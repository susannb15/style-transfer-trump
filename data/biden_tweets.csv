America is at its best when we’re OPTIMISTIC and we THINK BIG.
There’s no one better positioned on Earth to lead the world in the 21st century than America. We just have to believe it.

The Senate health bill isn't about health care at all—it's a wealth transfer: slashes care to fund tax cuts for the wealthy &amp; corporations.

"@washingtonpost Republican leadership's “health” bill would return us to a time when health care was a privilege for the wealthy, not a right for all."
"@washingtonpost By denying this right, Republican leadership’s “health” bill is fundamentally flawed. It can’t even be fixed on the floor."
@washingtonpost All Americans deserve the peace of mind that comes with knowing that you can get affordable care. But that’s now under threat.
"@washingtonpost If you believe health care is a right for all, make sure your senators know that this bill is a big step backward."

"Yesterday’s Supreme Court decision was a huge blow to workers.  It denies them the ability to take their employers to court if they're being cheated out of pay, forced to work in unsafe conditions, or sexually harrassed."
It favors the powerful over the powerless and stacks the deck even further against working people.  It's wrong.
"Today, the @OECD officially invited Colombia to become its 37th member.  Congratulations to President @JuanManSantos and the people of Colombia for all the hard work you’ve done to create a more prosperous and secure future for your country."
"Our men &amp; women in uniform are the heart, the soul, and the spine of this nation. Today we remember those among them who gave their lives for our freedom. As we honor their sacrifice, we must recommit to our sacred obligation to care for &amp; support the families they left behind."
"Last year, Virginians showed up to elect leaders who believe health care is a right, not a privilege. As a result, hundreds of thousands of Virginians now have the peace of mind that comes with health insurance. Don't ever question whether your vote matters -- it does. Show up."
"They may have murdered our heroes, but the dream still lives buried deep in our broken hearts. Fifty years after he was taken from us, Robert Kennedy still inspires. #RFK50"
"Putin’s Russia invaded its neighbors, violated our sovereignty by undermining elections, and attacks dissidents abroad. Yet our President wants to reward him with a seat at the table while alienating our closest democratic allies. It makes no sense."
"GOP all-out assault on healthcare continues. First, they want to cut funding for CHIP. Now DOJ trying to end protections for pre-existing conditions. We have to fight back."
"I said a year ago we’re living through a battle for the soul of this nation. Now there can be no doubt. Roe, Obergefell, Fisher, and more—so many of our fundamental rights, freedoms, and liberties—and the rule of law—are all at risk."
I wish this President would engage in conversations and nominate a consensus candidate. That’s what we’ve done in the past. That’s what America needs and deserves. He won’t.
I wish this Senate would force a consensus choice—as we did with Justice Kennedy—it no longer has the will.
Advice and consent. Absent that—which we’ve always had for nominees in election years in the past—we shouldn’t move forward with hearings or a vote before the mid-term elections.
"It’s up to us, America. Speak out. Rise up. Be heard. The price to be paid for putting our values at risk must be clear. Now. 

And show up to vote this November—in numbers like we’ve never seen."
"Another shooting. Another night in America where a father, a wife, a friend, a neighbor won’t be coming home. We can’t accept this. It must end. Congress must act. Our hearts are with the #CapitalGazette"
Keep our eyes on the horizon - look to the future. Nothing is beyond our capacity as Americans. Happy #FourthofJuly from the Biden Family.
"Today we honor the memory of Heather Heyer, whose spirit we see in every person who stands up to reject hatred and bigotry. Make no mistake: this fight goes on. The battle for the soul of this nation rests with each of us, everyday."
"In the time I have known him, John Brennan has never been afraid to speak up and give it to you straight. Revoking his security clearance is an act unbecoming of a President. If you think it will silence John, then you just don't know the man."
Aretha Franklin was so much more than a great entertainer. She inspired. She gave hope. She was part of the soul of the civil rights movement. We won't see her like again.
Kofi Annan knew that human beings acting together could make the world better. He dedicated his life to that belief. He insisted that defending human rights and dignity were part of our responsibilities to one another. We are all better for his influence on our world.
"Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales’s decision to end CICIG’s mandate represents a serious blow to anti-corruption efforts in the hemisphere. 

The US Administration should condition assistance on CICIG’s continued operation."
"Inspiring words from @BarackObama today.  A powerful reminder that it's on all of us to vote this fall if we want leaders who reflect the civility, character, dignity, and goodness of the American people. The stakes couldn't be higher, but Americans always rise to the occasion."
"In the wake of darker moments in our history, our spirit has become mightier. The bonds that unite us have become thicker.
 
Seventeen years after the 9/11 attacks, may we continue to live that legacy in our words and our deeds, every day. In America, we can overcome anything."
Dr. James Allison and Dr. Tasuku Honjo’s immunotherapy discovery uses our own body’s defenses to destroy cancer. Today’s @NobelPrize award is a significant leap toward ending cancer as we know it and paving the path to a cure. Congratulations and thank you.
"Joe Tydings and I were both inspired by JFK &amp; RFK and their call to service. In the Senate, he lived up to their example with an ironclad commitment to fight the abuse of power and work to ensure that every American gets a fair shot. Joe made America better—he will be missed."
"20 years have passed since the murder of young Matthew Shepard. We've come a long way, thanks to organizations like @MattShepardFDN, but our work isn’t done. We cannot stop fighting until every LGBTQ young person is affirmed, supported, and safe. #MSF20"
"This country has to come together. This division, this hatred, this ugliness has to end."
"What an honor to be joined by @Alyssa_Milano on tonight’s #ItsOnUs student organizing call. Alyssa, your courage reignited a movement, and your continued advocacy inspires me every day. Thank you."
"It’s the most fundamental American right: the right to vote — and for your vote to be counted. Count all the votes in Florida, Georgia, and Arizona. Count them fairly. Count them transparently."
"Every military family knows what it means to sacrifice. Every individual life and story matters. It is who we are as Americans. 

On #VeteransDay and every day we must stand up for the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us."
Congratulations to @kyrstensinema for a well-earned victory tonight. She’s going to do incredible work for Arizona. Credit to @MarthaMcSally as well for handling the results with true dignity and class.
"Grateful for the time spent with loved ones this Thanksgiving, and grateful for the sacrifice of those military families whose loved ones are on duty, unable to be with their families. From our family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving."
"I’ve had disagreements with Secretary Mattis, but we shared the view — long-held by Democrats and Republicans in this nation — that respect for our allies and a commitment to the most important and effective alliances in history made America safer."
It is clear this administration has abandoned those core American beliefs. Secretary Mattis’ presence and his voice of reason and experience will be missed in the Pentagon and the Situation Room.
"“Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex.” 

Another step forward for equality and basic dignity in Delaware tonight, as the Equal Rights Amendment is enshrined in our state’s Constitution."
"Congratulations to the two women who led the way: @RepLonghurst and @HansenForSenate, as well as all of the lawmakers, activists, and citizens who made this happen."
The spirit of Dr. King is still with us. It has burrowed deep into the soul of this nation. It will not let us rest. On #MLKDay we must heed Dr. King’s admonition from his final sermon and do our part to “make America what it ought to be.”
"An untested rape kit means a survivor without justice. I wrote the first rape kit backlog law because every survivor deserves closure, and because evidence shows testing kits can identify men who have committed multiple rapes - and might again. Test every kit. Every single one."
Students and survivors are making their voices heard. Grassroots organizers are working to make sure these guidelines are never put into effect.
"Fellow @UDelaware Blue Hen @Sage_Gaea of @knowyourIX has done so much for the students of Delaware through her advocacy, and is now fighting for students across the country."
"There is no place for racism in America. Governor Northam has lost all moral authority and should resign immediately, Justin Fairfax is the leader Virginia needs now."
Stacey Abrams achieved in a matter of minutes something Donald Trump failed to do in over an hour -- to embrace and give voice to the spirit and core values that make America great.
John Dingell was the Dean of the House. He earned that title — not just because he was there the longest — but because he led with great moral courage and vision. He was a friend and I will miss him terribly. Debbie is in my prayers.
Only a tyrant would prevent the delivery of food and medicine to people he claims to lead. The international community must support Juan Guaido and the National Assembly. It is time for Maduro to step aside and allow a democratic transition. The Venezuelan people deserve better.
"I know from personal experience the only way to overcome grief is to find purpose. The Parkland students &amp; families will not allow us to turn away from our responsibilities to those 17 fallen angels. We aren’t there yet, but with their determination &amp; insistence, we’ll get there."
"One year after the tragic massacre in Parkland, we’ve not done nearly enough to ensure this will never happen again. In the last year far too many have died from gun violence. But I have hope. #MSDStrong"
"When I wrote the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, I believed it would be a lifeline. But this Congress has turned it into a political football. It’s time to pass a strong reauthorization to the Violence Against Women Act. No more stalling. Lives are on the line."
"Since the passage of VAWA, annual rates of domestic violence have dropped by 63%. The National Domestic Violence Hotline responds to more than 26,000 people a month, creating a safety net for survivors. We have made progress, but there is much more to do. Right now."
"One in five women will still be victims of rape or attempted rape in their lifetimes. On average, three women a day are murdered by their husbands or boyfriends. Nothing is more urgent than reauthorizing and expanding the law that makes women safer."
"VAWA’s power is that it gets stronger with each reauthorization. This year can be no different. Like was done in 2000 and 2005 and 2013, we must expand the reach of VAWA to respond to the needs of survivors at risk every day."
"There is nothing more powerful that Congress can do to help women, strengthen families, and save lives than reauthorizing VAWA. Now."
"Stand with survivors and advocates like @nguyen_amanda, @ZerlinaMaxwell, @ruthmglenn, @DavidsonJess22, @Mariska, and so many others. Reauthorize VAWA now."
"Today I congratulated President @IvanDuque on his successful visit to Washington. Maintaining strong bipartisan support for #Colombia is vitally important to meeting key security and economic challenges in the hemisphere, including humanitarian aid for refugees from #Venezuela."
"@CynthiaNixon You’re right, Cynthia. I was making a point in a foreign policy context, that under normal circumstances a Vice President wouldn’t be given a silent reaction on the world stage. 

But there is nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights, and that includes the Vice President."
"Joe Boardman led @Amtrak through difficult times, taking over during the worst economic crisis since the Depression, and starting a modernization that will help deliver the 21st century rail system America deserves. My thoughts are with his wife Joanne and their family."
"No one should live in fear of being fired, evicted from their home, or denied service in a restaurant just because of their gender identity or who they love. The #EqualityAct is long overdue, and will ensure LGBTQ Americans are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve."
"On behalf of Jill, myself, and all of the Bidens, our hearts go out to the community in Christchurch suffering from today’s senseless violence. Friday prayers for those who were gathered at their mosques has seen families torn apart by hate."
"Whether it is antisemitism in Pittsburgh, racism in Charlottesville, or the xenophobia and Islamophobia today in Christchurch, violent hate is on the march at home and abroad. We cannot stand by as mosques are turned into murder scenes."
Silence is complicity. Our children are listening. The time to speak out is now.
"The people of Guatemala should be the ones to choose their next president. The stakes are high: promoting transparency, shared prosperity, and combating corruption. For this reason, the @TSEGuatemala needs to certify all eligible presidential candidates by the Sunday deadline."
"Whether on the assembly line, at the grocery store checkout, or in the boardroom, every woman deserves to make every penny a man doing the same job makes. The #PaycheckFairnessAct will help us get there. Congratulations @rosadelauro and thank you for your leadership on this."
.@NRA opposition to a full reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act is sickening. We must do more to protect victims of stalking and abuse. It makes no sense to allow those who perpetrated the abuse to have access to deadly firearms. We must stand up now for survivors.
"For centuries, Notre Dame Cathedral has withstood wars, revolutions, and the test of time. It is a symbol of faith &amp; a testament to history. And even as our hearts break to see it burn today during the holiest week of the year for Catholics, I have faith that it will rise again."
Looking forward to joining the women of @TheView today for my first live interview since announcing my 2020 campaign for President. Tune in 11e|10c|p on @ABCNetwork. #TheView
"Jill and I are devastated to hear about today’s shooting at the Chabad Poway synagogue. No one should have to worship in fear.

As a country, we must speak out against bigotry and gun violence. We’re in the battle for the soul of this nation—and it’s on all of us to act."
"Wishing everyone in the Orthodox Christian community a peaceful and joyful Easter celebration with friends, family and loved ones. God Bless."
"Dick Lugar was among the most decent men I have ever known. Kind, loyal, dedicated beyond measure to the service of the American people. Dick Lugar was my dear friend. 

Jill and I send our condolences to his wife Charlene and the entire Lugar family."
"I'm sick of this President badmouthing unions. Labor built the middle class in this country. Minimum wage, overtime pay, the 40-hour week: they exist for all of us because unions fought for those rights. We need a President who honors them and their work."
"We must turbocharge our efforts to address climate change that threatens communities across the country. Through clean, renewable energy and cleaner, safer, faster transportation, America will not only help the environment but provide millions of good-paying middle-class jobs."
"By making post-secondary education and training affordable to and making sure the economy works not only for folks with a four-year degree but also for those who complete on-the-job training and trade programs, too."
"Whether you’re covered through your employer, on your own, or not at all - you should have a choice to buy into a public option health plan like Medicare."
"We need to get rid of the capital gains loophole for multimillionaires. I’m going to change it so millionaires and billionaires don’t pay lower tax rates than teachers and firefighters. We need to reward work in this country, not just wealth."
"Companies continue to squeeze every last penny out of workers, making it harder and harder for Americans to make ends meet. It’s way past time we make a $15 minimum wage the law of the land."
This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs and hedge fund managers. It was built by you. The great American middle class. That’s the story of America and together we can rebuild the backbone of this nation.
"Twelve years of education is not enough. In order to rebuild a strong middle class, we must provide skills needed to do the jobs of the 21st Century."
"The Affordable Care Act was a huge step forward for this country. Now we have to finish the job and make health care a right, not a privilege, and give everyone the peace of mind they deserve."
"Today, The House will hold it's first hearing on the Equal Rights Amendment in 36 years. It's way past time to give all people protection under the Constitution--human rights should never be caught up in the whims of whichever political party is in power. We need the #ERANow."
"The violence in Venezuela today against peaceful protesters is criminal. Maduro's regime is responsible for incredible suffering. The U.S. must stand with the National Assembly &amp; Guaidó in their efforts to restore democracy through legitimate, internationally monitored elections."
I’m the proud husband of a teacher and know first-hand the impact of their work. Teachers around the country and in South Carolina deserve to earn a living wage and have smaller class sizes so that America can continue to out-educate and lead the world. #AllOutMay1
"Today, the House votes on #HR9, the #ClimateActionNow Act, which restores our commitment to the #ParisAgreement. We need to face facts on climate change. It’s already here. It is a major threat to our future and we simply cannot wait to take action."
"On Holocaust Remembrance Day, let us pause and reflect on the millions of Jews who lost their lives at the hands of the Nazi regime.

The events of the last few months remind us that it’s not enough to just say never again—we must speak up and act against hate."
"Last year, Floridians voted to restore voting rights to those who served their time for felonies. But today, Florida's Senate votes on a bill that would instead create a modern-day poll tax, suppressing the vote of tens of thousands of Americans. This is unacceptable."
"I’ve seen the selfless heroism of firefighters firsthand — they run toward danger and risk their lives every single day for strangers. On International Firefighters' Day, I extend my deepest gratitude to all the men and women who keep our communities safe."
"On this first day of Ramadan, Jill and I wish peace and happiness to Muslims around the world celebrating the holy month. Ramadan Kareem."
"Congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, on the birth of their baby boy! The truth is there’s no better job than being a parent. Jill and I wish you the best of luck on your next chapter."
"@samanthapetrick Hey Rocco, happy 9th birthday! Sorry I missed the party. I hope you got some ice cream with that #Biden2020 cookie."
Kendrick Castillo will not collect his high school diploma this week because he gave his life trying to protect his classmates from another senseless act of violence in an American school yesterday. My heart goes out to his family and all those affected by yesterday's shooting.
We must remember Kendrick's name and sacrifice. We must ensure his legacy lives in our shared commitment to stopping these tragedies. Children shouldn’t fear going to school and parents shouldn't need to rely on the uncommon courage of an 18-year-old hero to keep their kids safe.
I’m proud to stand with Uber and Lyft drivers across the country today. Every worker in this country deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
I’m proud to have been one of the first to introduce climate change legislation. What I fought for in 1986 is more important than ever — climate change is an existential threat. Now. Today.
We need policies that reflect this urgency. I'll have more specifics on how America can lead on climate in the coming weeks.
"Republicans in AL, FL, GA, and OH are ushering in laws that clearly violate Roe v Wade and they should be declared unconstitutional. Roe v Wade is settled law and should not be overturned. This choice should remain between a woman and her doctor."
"No one should be fired, denied a home or access to services because of who they are or who they love. But that’s not the reality for many LGBTQ Americans.

Today’s historic passage of the #EqualityAct moves us one step closer to righting this wrong — the Senate should act now."
"The life of my love — the love of my life — the person who put our family back together. I love you, Jilly! @DrBiden"
Thanks so much for following along this afternoon! Follow @TeamJoe to stay up-to-date on everything happening on the campaign. #TeamJoe signing off!
"My dad had to make that walk in Scranton, Pennsylvania. It wasn’t until I was older that I realized how hard it must have been for him.

But he was not alone. This story isn’t unique to the Bidens. Too many people around this country have had to make that walk."
Trump doesn’t understand the struggles working folks go through. He doesn’t understand what it’s like to worry you will lose the roof over your head. He doesn’t understand what it’s like to wonder if you’ll be able to put food on the table.
"Yesterday, Trump tried to attack me at his campaign rally by saying I abandoned Pennsylvania.

I’ve never forgotten where I came from. My family did have to leave Pennsylvania when I was 10 — we moved to Delaware where my Dad found a job that could provide for our family."
"And he doesn’t understand that the longest walk a parent can make is up a short flight of stairs to their child’s bedroom to say, honey, I'm sorry. We have to move. You can’t go back to your school. You won’t see your friends because Daddy or Mommy lost their job."
"In the 25 years since we passed the Violence Against Women Act, we’ve made great strides in protecting women from abuse. But the latest reauthorization is being held up by the @NRA. It’s outrageous. This shouldn’t be a partisan issue—the Senate should pass the #VAWA immediately."
"Over the last year, six children have tragically died in US custody at the border. It’s unacceptable. It’s not who we are. And silence is complicity. It’s on all of us to stand up and speak out. America is a nation of immigrants. We must guarantee everyone's treated with dignity."
"With so much happening on the campaign, we want to make sure you’re up-to-date on the latest news. Text JOIN right now to 30330 to make sure you don’t miss a thing!"
"Every #MemorialDay, Jill and I remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice in service of our nation. Our troops are the heart, soul, &amp; spine of America—may we never fail to honor the memory of those who have fallen and ensure their spirit lives on in both our words and deeds."
"Our plan will increase teacher pay and provide them with the support they deserve. We’ll invest in all children from birth, so that regardless of their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability they are prepared to succeed in tomorrow’s economy."
"@KamalaHarris @DrBiden Thank you @KamalaHarris from me, Jill, &amp; all the Bidens for your kind remembrance of Beau today. 

My dad used to say that you know you are a success as a parent when you turn &amp; look at your child &amp; realize they turned out better than you — I'm so proud of the man Beau became."
"Thad Cochran was a friend and a true patriot in every sense of the word. Jill and I are sending our condolences to Thad’s family, he will be sorely missed."
11 innocent lives cut down. 11 more futures denied. When will we finally say enough is enough? It’s long past time to hold our leaders accountable. Jill and I are heartbroken that more American families are suffering tonight in Virginia Beach.
"Pride is about standing up to the voices of injustice and discrimination and declaring that everyone has the right to live proud, open, and free. It's about love. We join the LGBTQ community in celebration and remember the fight is not over. We march on. Happy #PrideMonth"
Today is the anniversary of China's brutal crackdown in Tiananmen Square. Authorities tried to stop peaceful calls for political change with rifles &amp; tanks. The courage of the Tiananmen generation hasn't been silenced &amp; still inspires the fight for freedom and justice worldwide.
"China’s continuing oppression of its own people, especially the abuse and internment of more than one million Uyghurs, is one of the worst human rights crises in the world today. It can’t be ignored. Human rights must be at the core—not periphery—of our engagement in the world."
"As the sun sets around the world, Jill and I want to extend our warmest wishes to those marking the end of Ramadan. May your celebrations be filled with family and joy. #EidMubarak"
"75 years ago, far from home, on those bloody beachheads of Normandy, thousands of brave young Americans risked everything to prove that freedom, justice, and democracy would never bend before the forces of fascism and intolerance."
"With uncommon courage and unfailing honor, Allied forces claimed the first few feet in the drive to turn back an empire born of hatred and prevent it from consuming Europe. They did it not for personal posterity or political gain, but simply because there was no other choice."
We will never forget what the conviction and mettle of those young patriots achieved—for all of us.
Their valor cemented in history their place of honor and it planted the seeds of what would grow to become the greatest military alliance in the history of the world—one that would preserve the peace and extend the hard won gains of democracy for their children and grandchildren.
"Today, we honor all those who answered duty’s call on June 6, 1944, not only in memorials and remembrances, but in recommitting ourselves to the urgent task of defending those values for which they fought and so many died."
"Women’s rights and health care are under assault in a way that seeks to roll back every step of progress we’ve made over the last 50 years. If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone’s zip code."
"I know how to beat the NRA because I’ve done it before - twice. I shepherded through the passage of the Brady background check bill in 1993, and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in 1994. As president, I will defeat the NRA again."
We can’t let a special interest group dictate the safety of the rest of the country. That’s why defeating the NRA is a key element of our education policy we introduced last week.
"We will be rolling out policies to reduce gun violence in the coming months, but it’s clear we need to: 
- Close the loophole that allows individuals to buy guns online or at gun shows without a background check.
- Ban the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines."
There are actions that Congress can take right now if they were to listen to the majority of the American people who want to see our government take action to stop gun violence.
"Today is #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay. Our team, and people across the country, are wearing orange in remembrance of the countless lives that have been cut short by senseless acts of gun violence in America."
We don't need to convince the American public that common-sense measures to reduce gun violence are a good idea. 2 in 3 people believe that we need stricter gun laws.
This is politics at its worst. We should all feel safe to walk the streets of our own cities and towns. Our workers should feel safe at work. Our students should always feel safe at school.
We need action. But the NRA and gun manufacturers have such a firm grip on Republicans in Congress that they refuse to consider common-sense gun reforms.
"Happy birthday to one of the strongest people Jill and I know, @GabbyGiffords. You are an inspiration to so many people. Your courage and your advocacy have made our country a better place."
"Hey everyone, @TeamJoe here. We’re taking over to keep you in the loop on our event in Ottumwa, Iowa. Stay tuned! #TeamJoe"
"When it comes to President Trump’s tariff war with China, one thing is clear: America’s farmers and manufacturers are getting crushed – no one knows that better than Iowa. 

To Trump, the people getting hurt are just pawns in his game. #TeamJoe"
"He thinks he’s being tough. Well, it’s easy to be tough when someone else is feeling the pain. How many farmers across Iowa and across this nation are facing the prospect of losing their business, of losing their farm because of Trump’s tariffs? #TeamJoe"
"Trump doesn’t get the basics. He thinks his tariffs are being paid by China. Any freshman econ student could tell you that the American people are paying his tariffs.

The cashiers at Target see what’s going on – they know more about economics than Trump. #TeamJoe"
We can’t afford four more years of an administration that gambles with the livelihoods of American families. Working families deserve a president who is fighting for them. #TeamJoe
Thank you for following along this afternoon! Follow @TeamJoe to keep up with everything happening on the campaign. #TeamJoe
President Trump is bringing his secret one page agreement with Mexico to Iowa. The Iowans being crushed by his tariffs would like to see it.
President Trump thinks his tariffs are being paid by China. Just like he thinks Mexico is building the wall.
"Prayers are not enough to end these senseless mass shootings. This violence is not normal. As a country, we have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to stop the gun violence epidemic."
"Today in 1967, the Supreme Court struck down interracial marriage bans in Loving v. Virginia—a decision that inched us closer to our founding ideals of equality, equity, &amp; fairness.

The decision reminds us progress doesn’t happen on its own—every generation has to fight for it."
President Trump is once again welcoming foreign interference in our elections. This isn’t about politics. It is a threat to our national security. An American President should not seek their aid and abet those who seek to undermine democracy.
Every worker in this country deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages and benefits — and the right to collectively bargain. I’m proud to stand with Detroit security officers today as they fight for a $15 minimum wage and union rights. #OneDetroit
This is simple. No candidate running for office should help foreign governments undermine our democracy. That includes the sitting President of the United States. Our elections should be decided by the American people — not Vladimir Putin.
"The extraordinary bravery shown by hundreds of thousands in Hong Kong, marching for the civil liberties &amp; autonomy promised by China is inspiring. And the world is watching. All of us must stand in support of democratic principles and freedom."
"This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers, CEOs, or hedge fund managers. It was built by the American middle class. It’s time we recognize that.

We’ve got to build an economy and a tax code that rewards work, not just wealth."
"7 years ago, @BarackObama and I offered security to DREAMers, young people brought here as kids who only know America as home. Trump is trying to break our country's promise to them &amp; continues to threaten their status.

DREAMers are Americans. It’s time we kept our word to them."
"Four years ago, a white supremacist walked into ""Mother Emanuel"" and gunned down nine brave souls, including my friend Clementa Pinckney. It's not enough to remember them. We have to fight for them. We are in a battle for the soul of this nation."
"Today, I took @EricHolder's @demredistrict pledge to support #FairMaps. For too long, gerrymandering has allowed politicians to pick who they represent. That’s wrong. I’m committed to fair redistricting where elected officials are accountable to those they represent."
"I was honored to join @UniteThePoor, @RevDrBarber, and @liztheo at today’s #PPCMoralCongress Presidential Forum."
"I talked about how the greatest sin is the abuse of power — whether economic, or physical, or social. And, it’s our duty to fight back against those who would abuse it.

That starts with access to a real living wage — a $15 minimum wage."
"I declared that we have to do everything we can to protect the most sacred, fundamental right we have: the right to vote."
"Lastly, I discussed how my health care plan will include access to a Medicare-like public option for anyone who wants it."
"It will also include premium-free access to this public option for people who would otherwise qualify for Medicaid, but have been denied access to it by governors and state legislatures who have refused the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion."
"Hey there - @TeamJoe here. President Trump dismisses everything he doesn’t want to hear as “FAKE NEWS” -- so as he announces his re-election, we want to make sure you have the real facts on his record:"
"Let’s be clear: President Trump inherited a growing economy from the Obama-Biden administration. And now, he’s in the process of squandering it."
"Trump continues to undermine our standing in the world.

Our core values of inclusivity, diversity, respect for the rule of law, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion are under attack here at home and abroad."
"Trump’s response to Charlottesville two years ago was abhorrent, but it’s not just that. It’s happening every day. Separating children from their parents at the border. Attacking women's rights. Rolling back LGBTQ protections. 

We’re better than this."
"Trump’s policies appear intentionally designed to aggravate the situation to scare Americans into re-electing him. Cutting off aid to Central America will increase migration to our Southern border, not reduce it."
"America was founded on the ideals of equality, equity, &amp; fairness—but has failed to live up to that promise for all people. In 2019, the unemployment rate for black people is almost twice that of white people. Children born poor are twice as likely to stay poor if they’re black."
"As we recognize Juneteenth and the progress we’ve made since slavery, we must also double down on our efforts to root out systemic racism. We have to make sure we’re working to move closer to that more perfect union, to the idea of America that has inspired so many generations."
President Trump's Iran strategy is a self-inflicted disaster. Two of America's vital interests in the Middle East are preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and securing a stable energy supply through the Strait of Hormuz. Trump is failing on both counts.
He unilaterally withdrew from the hard-won nuclear agreement that the Obama-Biden Administration negotiated to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Trump promised that abandoning the deal and imposing sanctions would stop Iran’s aggression in the region.
"But they’ve only gotten more aggressive. Trump also promised that walking away would somehow lead to a better deal – instead, the predictable has happened: Iran is building back up its nuclear capability."
"It’s sadly ironic that the State Department is now calling on Iran to abide by the very deal the Trump Administration abandoned.

By walking away from diplomacy, Trump has made military conflict more likely. Another war in the Middle East is the last thing we need."
Make no mistake: Iran continues to be a bad actor that abuses human rights and supports terrorist activities throughout the region.
"What we need is presidential leadership that will take strategic action to counter the Iranian threat, restore America's standing in the world, recognize the value of principled diplomacy, and strengthen our nation and our security by working strategically with our allies."
"I support @PPact because women and transgender individuals' health care is essential. Historically, women — and particularly women of color — have been put in a position where they cannot access health care, in a more extreme way more than any other part of the population."
"Trump’s erratic, impulsive actions are the last thing we need as Commander-in-Chief. No president should order a military strike without fully understanding the consequences. We don’t need another war in the Middle East, but Trump’s actions toward Iran only make that more likely."
"The Trump Administration is arguing in the 9th Circuit that migrant children held in detention centers without soap, toothbrushes or beds are in conditions that are “safe and sanitary”.

It’s an all-out assault on human dignity and our standards as a nation. We must do better."
"We must secure our borders, but “build the wall” is a slogan divorced from reality. We need to focus on improving screening procedures at our legal ports of entry &amp; making smart investments in border technology. These policies will do more for our security than a wall ever could."
"DREAMers are Americans, and Congress needs to make it official. The millions of DREAMers and undocumented individuals in the United States can only be brought out of the shadows through fair treatment, not ugly threats."
"One year ago, the Supreme Court upheld Trump's Muslim ban—one of this administration's most egregious attacks on our core values. Wielding the politics of fear and intolerance by slandering entire religious communities as complicit in terrorism is wrong, and it’s not who we are."
"All marriages, at their root, are about love. And four years ago, the Supreme Court affirmed that simple proposition in Obergefell v. Hodges. Thank you to the generations of LGBTQ trailblazers who refused to bend before the voices of intolerance. Your courage changed the world."
Today the Supreme Court refused to stop politicians rigging our democracy by writing election rules for their own benefit. It couldn’t have happened without Justices put there by Donald Trump and Republicans — another reason why Democrats must take back the White House in 2020.
"Today’s decision from the court hopefully means there will not be a question on the 2020 Census, but we have much more work to do to ensure all voices are heard in our democracy."
"Make no mistake, the Trump Administration added a citizenship question to the Census to deliberately cut out the voices of immigrants and communities of color. It’s wrong and goes against our core values as a nation."
"In America, every worker deserves fair treatment, safe workplaces, and the right to join a union. Period. I’m proud to stand in solidarity with airport workers across the country as they strike for their right to organize. #RespectUSworkers"
"In an hour, I’ll take the stage for the first Democratic debate to discuss my vision for the country. As I’ve said from day one, I’m running for president for three reasons: to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild its backbone — the middle class, and unify all Americans."
"We know in our bones this election is different. We have a president who promotes hate and division. Encourages white supremacists. Embraces dictators. And damages our alliances internationally.

Our politics traffics in division. And our president is the divider in chief."
"Every day we are being reminded what this election is about. Who we are. What we stand for. What we believe. I am running to offer our country a different path – not back to a past that never was, but to a future that fulfills our true potential as a country."
"We have to rebuild the backbone of this nation – the middle class. And this time make sure everyone comes along, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or disability."
The poor are getting poorer and the bottom is falling out of the middle class. Income inequality is on the rise — made worse by the Trump tax cut that was a giant give-away to the super-wealthy.
"It’s time to reward work, not just wealth. On day one, I’ll move to: eliminate the Trump tax cut for the super-wealthy, cut the unjustified loopholes in our tax code, and use that money to invest in America’s future."
We need to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act. I was proud every day to serve alongside President Obama as Vice President – but never more so than the day the Affordable Care Act passed. Now we have to finish the job.
"Under my plan, everyone will have the option to buy into a public health plan like Medicare. And we’ll guarantee that the poor – who otherwise would be covered by the Medicaid expansion – are automatically covered, free of charge."
We can do all this and more – all that stands in the way is a broken political system. We have to unite this country. And we can do it without compromising our principles. That’s the only way we’re going to be able to harness the incredible potential of the American people.
"I’m about to take the debate stage. The large, diverse Democratic field is evidence of our party's strength. And above all, we all agree that we need to make Donald Trump a one-term president. #DemDebate"
"Hey everyone — @TeamJoe here! We’re taking over @JoeBiden’s account while he’s on stage for tonight’s Democratic debate. Throughout the evening, we’ll be giving you the facts on Joe and his record. #DemDebate"
"This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs and hedge fund managers. 

It was built by you. 

By ordinary people doing extraordinary things. That’s the history of the journey of America.
#DemDebate"
"As Vice President, Joe Biden worked with the leaders of the Northern Triangle (Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras) to institute reforms tackling corruption, violence, and economic inequality in their countries, reducing migration to the U.S. 
#DemDebate"
"The Iraq war was a strategic mistake that cost the U.S. dearly. As President, @JoeBiden will use military power responsibly, and never commit our forces to a conflict without fully preparing for the consequences. #DemDebate"
"The members of the NRA are not our opponents — the vast majority of them support common-sense reforms, including universal background checks. The gun manufacturers who bankroll the NRA are our opponent. 

As president, Biden will defeat them.
#DemDebate"
"That’s a wrap! Thanks for following along with us for night two of the Democratic debate. Make sure to follow @TeamJoe to stay up-to-date on everything happening on the campaign.
#DemDebate #TeamJoe"
"The same forces of hatred rooted in 'birtherism' that questioned @BarackObama's American citizenship, and even his racial identity, are now being used against Senator @KamalaHarris. It’s disgusting and we have to call it out when we see it. Racism has no place in America."
"Yet again, Donald Trump has demonstrated that he is more concerned with a photo op for himself than getting results for the American people. He has repeatedly elevated Kim Jong Un — a murderous tyrant — on the international stage in exchange for almost nothing."
"In this case, all Trump achieved was a mere promise to restart working-level negotiations — negotiations that should have never ended."
"Diplomacy is important, but diplomacy requires a strategy, a process, and competent leadership to deliver. After three made-for-TV summits, we still don't have a single concrete commitment from North Korea."
"Not one missile or nuclear weapon has been destroyed, not one inspector is on the ground. If anything, the situation has gotten worse. North Korea has continued to churn out fissile material and is no longer an isolated pariah on the world stage."
"And even as Trump has rushed to legitimize a dictator in North Korea with dozens of nuclear weapons, he trashed the Iran nuclear deal — a deal that was working to keep Iran far away from a single nuclear bomb."
"Iran needs to get back into compliance with its nuclear commitments, but Trump appears to have no plan for ensuring that result either. His policy of maximum pressure has produced worse than minimum results."
"Iran has now restarted its nuclear program and has become more, rather than less, aggressive. Trump's Iran policy has alienated us from our allies and taken us to the brink of another war in the Middle East.

Everything this president does is backwards."
"Income inequality is on the rise — made worse by the Trump tax cut that was a giant giveaway to the super-wealthy. We’ve got to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class.
 
That starts by rewarding work, not just wealth."
"The Department of Commerce just announced the 2020 Census will not have President Trump’s citizenship question. This is not only a victory for immigrants and Latinos, but for all Americans. Everyone deserves to be counted and have their voices heard without fear."
"Today marks 55 years since the signing of the Civil Rights Act — the landmark piece of legislation that brought our nation closer to fulfilling the promise that was made two centuries earlier in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A promise of equality, equity, and fairness for all."
It took the courage and determination of generations of African Americans who refused to wither in the face of racism and intolerance. Their resolve fundamentally changed the character of our nation for the better.
"The Civil Rights Act for the first time made real the possibility of equal access to employment. It outlawed discrimination in public facilities, and it gave the Attorney General of the United States of America the power to enforce the law to combat discrimination."
"It also laid the groundwork for other milestones and freedoms to follow — from the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Because when justice rings out for one group, it rings for all groups in America. We’re all made better."
"But as we mark the 55th anniversary, we must recognize that the work is not done. Too many Americans still face the sting of systemic racism and discrimination. We must double down on our efforts to root out these evils and ensure America lives up to its promise for all."
"El Departamento de Comercio anunció que el formulario Censo 2020 no tendrá la pregunta de ciudadanía de Trump. Esto no es solo una victoria para los inmigrantes y latinos, sino para todos los estadounidenses. Todos merecemos ser contados sin temor!"
"America is an idea — stronger than any army, more powerful than any dictator. It gives hope to the most desperate people on Earth. Instills in us the belief that no matter where you start in life, there's nothing you can't achieve.

That's worth celebrating. Happy #FourthofJuly"
"As I celebrate today with friends &amp; family, I am reflecting on the promise those rebels envisioned 243 years ago. America hasn’t lived up to that promise for most people—but we’ve never stopped trying. We must continue in our pursuit until we achieve equality &amp; liberty for all."
"We have to be against his policies that are further entrenching economic inequality in this nation. That are rigging the system against the middle class.

That too is an attack on our democracy, on our liberty."
"It’s not enough to be against the way Donald Trump conducts himself — we have to be against the way he assaults the dignity of women, people of color, and immigrants."
"We have to take on the inequalities in our system that are causing too many today—in America and around the world—to question their faith in the ability of democracy to deliver for them.

It’s not enough to be for political equality. We have to be for economic fairness as well."
"My liberty, depends on yours. Our liberty as a nation rests on our ability to ensure equal access and equal opportunity — not just for our own children, but all our children."
"America is the heart of the Free World, and we must defend it. That is how the #FourthOfJuly is best honored — by remembering that our Declaration is first and foremost a call to arms, in defense of liberty."
"And ever since then, presidents and patriots have gathered together on the Fourth to reflect on the greater meaning of our American experiment."
"243 years ago, a group of rebels in Philadelphia pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to a revolutionary idea, to the self-evident truth that all men — and women — are created equal."
"But we must also remember, as JFK put it, that ours is “not the individual liberty of one but the indivisible liberty of all.” Donald Trump doesn’t get that."
What will Donald Trump say this evening when he speaks to the nation at an event designed more to stroke his ego than celebrate American ideals? Will he speak to the example America must set to inspire the world?
"Will he offer a robust defense of the democratic values that have always been our strength in times of crisis? We all know the answer to that.

Donald Trump is incapable of celebrating what makes America great because he doesn’t get it."
"Every year on the #FourthOfJuly, presidents, elected leaders, and everyday Americans come together at parades, bbqs, and baseball games to celebrate humankind’s highest ideal — liberty. That’s what we’re celebrating today in Iowa."
"The Democratic Party is lucky to have leaders like Eric, and I look forward to continuing to work with him on the pressing issues facing Americans."
".@EricSwalwell ran a passionate campaign, and I commend him for bringing more attention to the urgent need for gun safety reform in America."
His leadership on the House Intelligence Committee and his influential voice pushing the Trump Administration to secure our elections have helped make clear the stakes for our country in next year's election.
"The Affordable Care Act was and is a big deal. It covered 20 million more people, protects more than 100 million people with pre-existing conditions, and expanded Medicaid — giving millions of Americans the peace of mind that comes with health insurance."
"We can’t tear down the ACA. We should protect and build on it. In America, health care should be a right—not a privilege.

As president, I’ll do everything in my power to stand up to the attacks on the ACA and expand coverage to ensure everyone has access to the care they need."
"The abuse of a child is one of the most heinous, despicable abuses of power imaginable. It is inexcusably poor judgment for a US Attorney to seek leniency for someone guilty of it. Secretary Acosta should provide his resignation immediately."
"Today, we celebrate Journeyman Lineman Recognition Day and the work @IBEW does to keep lineworkers safe. These brave men and women do the hard work of powering America’s electric grid, economy, and future. Our country can't function without the important work they do."
"We must once more harness that power and rally the Free World to meet the challenges facing our world today—and it falls to the United States of America to do it.

No other nation has the capacity. No other nation is built on that idea—that promise. And it’s in our self-interest."
"No army on earth can match how the electric idea of liberty passes freely from person to person, jumps borders, transcends languages and cultures—how it can supercharge communities of ordinary citizens into activists and organizers and change agents."
"The threat Donald Trump poses to our national security, and to who we are as a country, is so extreme we cannot afford to ignore it.

His erratic policies and failures to uphold basic democratic principles have muddied our reputation and our place in the world."
"In 2019, foreign policy is domestic policy, and domestic policy is foreign policy. They are a deeply connected set of choices we make about how to advance the American way of life and our vision for the future."
"Today in New York City, I laid out my foreign policy vision for America. A vision built on restoring dignified leadership at home and respected leadership on the world stage."
I’m heartbroken to hear of the passing of Héctor Figueroa. Héctor was a stalwart champion in the fight to ensure every worker receives the respect and dignity they’ve earned. My thoughts are with his family and his loved ones.
President Trump’s ICE raids are inhumane. His scare tactics solve nothing. We shouldn't be terrorizing communities and splitting up families. We should provide a pathway to citizenship and find a lasting solution.
Las redadas de inmigración (ICE) del presidente Trump son inhumanas. Sus tácticas no resuelven nada. No deberíamos estar aterrorizando comunidades y dividiendo familias. Debemos proporcionar un camino hacia la ciudadanía y encontrar una solución duradera.
"I understand the appeal of Medicare for All — but folks supporting it should be clear that it means getting rid of Obamacare. And, I'm not for that.

We should protect and build upon the Affordable Care Act and the progress we’ve made. Not tear it down and start over."
"Summer vacation season has started, but many hardworking Americans like the @ATUComm members currently striking the VTA/TCI aren’t taking a break in their fight for safe working conditions, higher wages, and good benefits. I’m proud to stand with them."
"President Trump’s entire re-election strategy is based on fear and hatred of migrants — this is just the latest example.

We can enforce our immigration laws with dignity — and fix the asylum system so that it is both fair to those who need protection and deters those who do not."
"Justice Stevens was a decent, honorable man who served our country well. He understood that the most important thing about being on the Court is treating people with dignity and respect. I was honored to have known him. @DrBiden and I are sending our prayers to his family."
"My plan recognizes how much rural communities contribute to this nation and how much they’ve been hurt by this president’s damaging policies. We are going to build a pathway to the middle class for rural Americans, in rural America."
"We will pursue a trade policy that works for American farmers, transform our agriculture sector, triple funding for rural broadband, and bring cutting-edge manufacturing jobs to rural America."
A Biden administration will help rural communities fully access federal resources and tackle persistent poverty in rural America.
"Rural health care will be a top priority in the Biden administration. Under our plan, rural hospitals won’t be threatened by having to get by on low Medicare reimbursement rates for all."
"We will provide rural hospitals with the adequate funding and flexibility they need to keep their doors open, double funding for community health centers, and expand the pipeline of rural health care providers."
"During Beau’s fight with glioblastoma, we learned about the incredible breakthroughs made in cancer treatment — and those that are right over the horizon. This is a fight we can't postpone. I know — with the power of America’s best minds — we can end cancer as we know it. #GBMDay"
"We’ve heard it before throughout our history, but it has no place in America in 2019.

It’s clear that Donald Trump is trying to divide us by race and gender. It’s immoral. Our children are listening."
Donald Trump thinks that our nation's great diversity makes us weak — because he has no idea what makes us great.
"Here's what has always made America great:

Honesty. Decency. Treating everyone with dignity. Demonizing no one — not the poor, the powerless, the immigrant, the other. Giving hate no safe harbor. Understanding that, as Americans, we are part of something bigger than ourselves."
"These members of Congress — children of immigrants, just like so many of us — are an example of exactly what makes America great."
"So, Mr. President, I am here to tell you this. This is OUR country: The United States of America. You'll never understand what makes us strong. And that's why the American people are going to vote you out of office next year."
"Four days ago, the President of the United States suggested that four elected members of Congress, all women of color, ought to ""go back"" to the countries ""from which they came."" And every day since he has repeated this ugly, racist refrain."
"Governor @RicardoRossello's comments are shameful. Hateful language should be given no safe harbor -- regardless of political title. The people of #PuertoRico will be heard, and they will decide who leads their government."
"Los comentarios del gobernador @RicardoRossello son vergonzosos. El lenguaje de odio no debe ser protegido, independientemente del título político. El pueblo de #PuertoRico será escuchado y decidirán quién va a dirigir su gobierno."
That's what we're capable of when we come together in service of something larger than ourselves. That's the America I have faith in.
"In that moment, we weren't thinking about being Democrats or Republicans. We weren't thinking about a way to contort the nation's victory in favor of one political faction or another. We were, quite simply, Americans—joined together in our wonder, awe, and shared humanity."
"Fifty years ago today, in every corner of our country, Americans gathered together to watch our nation put three astronauts on the moon. For a moment, we all held our breath together, knowing we were about to bear witness to a first for mankind."
"Seven years ago, our nation watched in horror at the news from Aurora, Colorado. 12 innocent lives, full of so much promise, were cut short in an act of terror. Many more injured and traumatized. Today, we recommit to taking action to reduce gun violence"
"9 years ago today, I proudly stood alongside President Obama as he signed the Wall Street reform and consumer protection bill into law. 

In the midst of the financial crisis we inherited, we fought to protect working Americans from predatory practices and prevent another crash."
Trump’s continued racist attacks against these members of Congress cannot be tolerated or excused. This is not who we are. We must hold him accountable for his words.
"It’s about time we start rewarding workers with the resources to live with dignity &amp; respect—that begins with better wages and benefits, and the right to collectively organize and strike.
Today, I stand with @unitehere airline catering workers as they rally together at DCA. #1Job"
"Russia undermined our democracy by interfering in the 2016 election. That's a fact. We need a President who will stand up to the Kremlin, push back against Putin, and take immediate steps to ensure the security of our elections."
"Governor @RicardoRossello’s resignation is a testament to the power of everyday people to effect change and a critical opportunity for Puerto Rico, which has been battered by natural disasters and corrupt governments for far too long. #PuertoRicoSeLevanta"
"Because a union fought for their private health insurance plan, Marcy and her husband were able to retire with dignity and respect. That’s why my plan to protect and build on Obamacare will give folks the option to choose what’s best for them."
The marine transit system in Alaska is vital to rural communities—but faces draconian cuts in funding. IBU is on strike to ensure this lifeline for Alaskans will continue to serve communities from Ketchikan to Kodiak. The governor must restore full funding immediately. @ILWU
"I've always been proud to have cosponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act, signed into law 29 years ago. Thanks to the vision &amp; persistence of @SenatorHarkin &amp; many disability leaders, this bill was a critical step in the fight for equal rights for people with disabilities."
"Growing up with a stutter, my parents taught me from a young age that being different is no barrier to success. Instead, the barrier is far too often our laws, our institutions, and our culture. The ADA began to change all of that."
.@RepCummings is one of the finest people I’ve ever served with. It is despicable for you to attack him and the people of Baltimore this way. Once again you have proved yourself unfit to hold the office. A President is supposed to lift this nation up. Not tear it down.
"Since the historic passage of the Affordable Care Act, Congressional Republicans have been fighting to it tear down. Two years ago today, they continued their crusade in an attempt to pass a “skinny repeal” of Obamacare—it failed."
.@TheRevAl is a champion in the fight for civil rights. The fact that President Trump continues to use the power of the presidency to unleash racist attacks on the people he serves is despicable. This hate has no place in our country. It's beneath the dignity of the office.
"We have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to stop America’s gun violence epidemic — that starts with taking on the powerful gun lobby and passing common-sense gun safety laws.

I’ve beaten the @NRA twice. And I’ll do it again in the White House."
"54 years ago, President Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into law. This landmark legislation changed the lives of millions by providing the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care."
Now I’m handing the account over to my team before I take the stage. They’ll keep you up-to-date on what’s happening at tonight’s #DemDebate. Make sure to follow along!
"We deserve leaders that unite us around our shared goals, rather than prey on our divisions. That’s why I’m running for president. To unite our country and put us on a different path — not back to a past that never was — but to a future that fulfills our true potential."
"As we gather in Detroit, it’s important that we recognize the significance of the Motor City. Because few cities embody the American spirit better than Detroit.

When it was knocked down flat on its back, it didn’t give up. It came roaring back."
"Detroit — and our country as a whole — is like its people: resilient and tough. Defined by a work ethic that is unmatched by any place in the world. And when given half a fighting chance, there’s nothing the American people can’t do."
"Tonight, I’ll take the stage in Detroit for the second #DemDebate. I’m excited to have the opportunity to discuss the issues on voters’ minds, why I’m running for president, and my bold vision for the future of our country."
"Hey everyone, @TeamJoe here! We’re taking over for tonight’s #DemDebate to give you the facts about Joe’s record on the issues and vision for our country. Stay tuned!"
"Mr. President, this is America. We're stronger because of this diversity, not in spite of it. #DemDebate"
"Healthcare is the most important issue to Americans. Senator Harris won't be able to beat Trump with double-talk on healthcare.
We have a plan that builds on the ACA by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system easier to navigate."
"As Vice President, Biden was a champion for efforts to implement the federal mental health parity law, improve access to mental health care, and eliminate the stigma. 

As president, he'll enforce our mental health parity laws and expand funding for mental health services."
"Because of the Affordable Care Act, 20 million Americans gained health insurance. Millions more gained critical protections. But the work isn’t over. As president, Biden won’t rest until everyone has access to the quality, affordable care they deserve. #DemDebate"
"Donald Trump is the problem with our immigration policy. He's using family separation as a weapon against desperate people seeking safety and a better life.

We need to defeat Donald Trump. #DemDebate"
Trump's immigration policies are an assault on human dignity. We aren't a country that denies children soap and a toothbrush. This is not who we are. #DemDebate
Las políticas de inmigración de Trump son un asalto a la dignidad humana. No somos un país que niegue a los niños jabón y cepillo de dientes. Esto no es lo que somos. #DemDebate
"The 1994 Crime Bill included: 

-The ground-breaking Violence Against Women Act
-Bans on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines
-Funding for drug courts and prevention

"In 2009, the Obama-Biden administration made a big bet on rescuing the US auto industry. It paid off:

-More than 646,000 auto jobs
-Auto production doubled in the US
-Auto sales hit an all-time high

Detroit was on the front lines of that recovery.
#DemDebate"
"Biden will stand up to the abuse of power by polluters who disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities. He’ll work to ensure that communities across the country from Flint, MI to Harlan, KY to the NH Seacoast have access to clean, safe drinking water."
"When it comes to trade, either we're going to write the rules of the road for the world or China is—and not in a way that advances our values. 

Meanwhile, this administration has launched trade wars against the very allies we need with us to change China’s behavior.
#DemDebate"
"Vice President Biden has fought for women's rights his whole career:

✓Wrote the Violence Against Women Act
✓Co-sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment 9 times
✓Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act: 1st Obama-Biden bill signed into law 
✓Co-sponsored the Pregnancy Discrimination Act"
"Finally, Joe Biden has been integral to some of the biggest child care tax credit wins in our history, including in the Recovery Act and the fiscal cliff deal.

And as president, he'll expand the child care tax credit to up to $8,000 per family.
#DemDebate"
"This attack from Senator Gillibrand has been two weeks in the making, and it STILL isn’t accurate. Let's set the record straight:"
"Here's the truth about Joe Biden's vote:

He wasn't opposed to the child care tax credit itself. He was opposed to this specific tax credit being made available to affluent people."
"Joe Biden believes that women have a constitutional right to choose. Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, and Biden will work to codify it. He’ll continue to fight for a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions with her doctor.
#DemDebate"
"Joe Biden has long believed that the US should narrow rather than broaden its military efforts in Afghanistan, and has for years advocated for ending the war responsibly. We can't keep spending tens of billions of dollars a year to sustain a stalemate.
#DemDebate"
That’s all we have for tonight’s #DemDebate—thanks for tuning in! Make sure to follow @TeamJoe to keep up-to-date with everything happening on our campaign.
"The U.S. has a responsibility to extend Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans fleeing desperate circumstances—violence, oppression, starvation. The House passed a bipartisan bill to take action, now @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell must bring it up for a vote. #TPS4VZ"
"I was surprised at all of the attacks on President Obama's record at the #DemDebate. The Obama-Biden Administration passed Obamacare, lead the world on combating climate change, and saved our economy from the brink of disaster.

He was a great president. We don’t say that enough."
"America must defend the values that unite us—we must lead the Free World. 

As president, I will remind the world who we are. The United States does not coddle dictators. The United States stands up for democracy."
"Donald Trump is echoing his authoritarian heroes, again—this time using China's anti-democracy talking points to describe the peaceful protests in Hong Kong as ""riots."" It's shameful.

When people suffering under oppression look to the U.S. for hope, Trump has nothing to offer."
"In the last three years, President Trump has turned our world upside down internationally and economically. People are hurting. The soul of our country is collapsing because of his presidency.

We have to be honest, straight forward, and authentic about what we will do to fix it."
"Heartbroken to hear the news from El Paso. Our thoughts are with those impacted by yet another senseless act of gun violence in America.

How many lives must be cut short? How many communities must be torn apart? It’s past time we take action and end our gun violence epidemic."
Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines don’t belong on our streets. We must stand up to the @NRA and gun manufacturers—they don’t own this country. We the people own this country.
"We have to address what’s happening in America. We continue to bear witness to acts of terror carried out with a common thread: hatred of “the other.” We saw it in Charlottesville two years ago, at synagogues in Pittsburgh and Poway, and now in El Paso."
"We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. And in this moment, we all have a responsibility to declare with conviction that hatred and bigotry and white supremacy have no place in America. We will give hate no safe harbor."
"At least 29 lives stolen, families broken, communities shattered in El Paso and Dayton within 13 hours. Dozens more wounded. Between those two mass shootings, dozens more were killed and injured by gun violence that didn't make national headlines."
"We can’t fix a problem if we refuse to name it: white nationalism. An ideology emboldened by a president who stokes the flames of hatred and coddles white supremacists with messages of support.

We must do what Trump won't: condemn this evil and eradicate it from our society."
"Thoughts and prayers won’t solve our broken gun laws. We need politicians with the courage to stand up to the powerful gun lobby and tell them that they don’t own this country.

I’ve beaten the @NRA twice, and I’ll do it again in the White House."
"The fight for civil rights is one of the things that got me engaged in politics. And when I was ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, we successfully extended the #VotingRightsAct for 25 years."
"But our job is not done. The #VotingRightsAct has been gutted by the Supreme Court &amp; voting rights are under siege across the country.

As president, I will restore the VRA, stand up to attacks on the right to vote, &amp; renew our efforts to ensure every American’s voice is equal."
"The words of a president matter. They can move markets. They can send our brave men and women to war. They can bring peace.

And they can unleash the deepest, darkest forces in this nation — like Donald Trump has chosen to do."
"When he said after Charlottesville that there were “very fine people on both sides” he gave license and safe harbor for hate to white supremacists, Neo-Nazis, and the KKK.

Those words stunned the nation and shocked the world."
I said at the time that we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. I said it again when I announced. It’s why I’m running for president.
"How far is it from Trump’s saying this “is an invasion” to the shooter in El Paso declaring “this attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas”?

Not far at all."
"How far is it from the white supremacists and Neo-Nazis in Charlottesville – Trump’s “very fine people” – chanting “You will not replace us” to the shooter at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh saying Jews “were committing genocide to his people.”

Not far at all."
"In both clear language and in code, this president has fanned the flames of white supremacy in this nation."
"I wish I could say this hate began with Trump and will end with him. It didn’t &amp; it won’t.

The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push-and-pull between the American ideal that we are all created equal &amp; the harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart."
"The honest truth is both elements are part of the American character. At our best, the American ideal wins out. But it’s never a rout. It’s always a fight. And the battle is never finished."
"At moments when we have been tested most, American presidents have stepped up. They led, opposed hate, and chose to fight for the best of the American character.

We don’t have that today. Our president has aligned himself with the darkest forces in this nation."
"Trump offers no moral leadership, no interest in unifying the nation, and no evidence the presidency has awakened his conscience in the least.

Instead, we have a president with a toxic tongue who has unapologetically embraced a political strategy of hate, racism, and division."
So it’s up to us. We’re living through a rare moment in this nation’s history. Where our president isn’t up to the moment. Where our president lacks the moral authority to lead. Where our president has more in common with George Wallace than George Washington.
"We are almost 330 million Americans who have to do what our president can’t. Stand together. Stand against hate. Stand up for what—at our best—this nation believes.

If we stand together, we will win the battle for the soul of this nation."
The @NRA doesn’t own this country. We the people own this country.
Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines don’t belong on our streets.
"Five years ago, Michael Brown's life was taken in Ferguson. His death stirred the conscience of our nation and awakened a generation of activists. We must ensure justice rings out for all in America — regardless of skin color."
"We need gun safety reform &amp; leaders who will step up to get it done. Gov. Sununu instead has decided to stand with President Trump in putting the gun lobby over common-sense reforms that will keep Granite Staters safe.

As president, I’ll take on the NRA &amp; win—again. #NHPolitics"
"Now is not the time to cower in the face of the @NRA, now is the time to stand up with courage and conviction and pass gun safety legislation. Lives depend on it."
".@DrBiden and I wish everyone celebrating #EidAlAdha hope, faith, and joy. Eid Mubarak!"
"It’s unacceptable that children learn to fear mass shooters alongside their ABCs.

It's unacceptable that people feel unsafe on their weekly grocery run.

It's unacceptable that living in fear of gun violence has become our new normal."
"The brave protestors in Hong Kong are demanding the rights and freedoms promised to them. The U.S. should be leading the free world to rally support behind them and, with one voice, defend our shared democratic ideals and the desire for liberty that beats in every heart."
"President Trump has emboldened white nationalists with messages of support, called Mexicans ""rapists,"" and told members of Congress to ""go back"" to where they came from.

The words of a president matter. And Trump has used his to unleash the deepest, darkest forces in our nation."
"Before I was Vice President, before I was a Senator — I started my career as an elected official on the New Castle County Council. Local races matter. I'm proud to sign the @runforsomething pledge to support candidates up and down the ballot to invest in our party’s future."
I have always been a stalwart supporter of Israel—a vital partner that shares our democratic values. No democracy should deny entry to visitors based on the content of their ideas—even ideas they strongly object to. And no leader of the free world should encourage them to do so.
"Gov. @Hickenlooper ran a strong campaign, talking about the urgent need to rebuild our middle class and standing up to President Trump's trade wars. Coloradans are lucky to have John in their corner, and I look forward to seeing what he does next."
A Biden administration will ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We will get these military-style weapons off our streets.
"I look forward to joining @GiffordsCourage and @AMarch4OurLives at their forum to discuss how we can take on the @NRA and end our gun violence epidemic. Together, we will get it done."
Let’s be clear: racism and hate have no safe harbor in America. We are stronger because of our diversity—not in spite of it.
"My plan to protect and build on Obamacare will not only provide coverage for uninsured Americans, but it will also make health care more affordable for those who already have coverage."
We cannot afford four more years of a president who ignores the disastrous effects of climate change. My plan for a Clean Energy Revolution &amp; Environmental Justice will address the climate emergency &amp; protect our communities for generations to come.
"99 years ago today, the 19th Amendment was ratified—enshrining in our Constitution that the right to vote cannot be denied based upon sex.

Today, access to the ballot box is still out of reach for too many Americans—it’s up to every single one of us to break down the barriers."
We will make Donald Trump a one-term president.
"Our teachers and firefighters should not pay a higher tax rate than Wall Street CEOs. That’s why I’ll repeal President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy and close capital gains loopholes.

It’s time we reward work, not just wealth."
"On day one, I will eliminate President Trump’s decision to limit asylum and undo his executive orders that eliminated Obama-Biden enforcement priorities on national security and public safety."
".@JayInslee brought an important voice to this race, arguing powerfully that climate change damages our health, national security &amp; economy. The people of Washington are fortunate to have a Governor who fights to make their lives better now &amp; to protect our planet for the future."
Firefighters face danger every day to protect our communities—we must be there for them in their time of need. Our thoughts are with the families of Justin and Brian as the search continues—and we thank those working tirelessly to bring their brothers home.
Building a more inclusive middle class is at the heart of this presidential campaign. That's why I support @Culinary226 and the Station Casino workers who voted to unionize. The will of the workers must be respected and management has to come to the negotiating table immediately.
"We need to take action now to address our climate crisis.

That starts with beating Donald Trump."
".@SethMoulton brought a vital voice to this primary, advocating for the urgent need to undo President Trump’s damage abroad and restore American leadership on the world stage. His passion for and knowledge of American foreign policy are impressive and needed in Congress."
"The U.S. stood with the Baltic States during the Soviet occupation—their flags always flew in D.C., affirming America's defense of democratic values. Today, we must stand with the people of Hong Kong &amp; ensure the U.S. remains a beacon of hope to people around the world."
"30 years ago, 2 million people joined hands to form the Baltic Way—a chain of human determination that reached across Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in defiance of Soviet oppression. It was—and remains—a powerful demonstration of the irrepressible desire for freedom."
"Today, demonstrators in Hong Kong, inspired by the iconic Baltic Way protest, formed a human chain to demand China live up to its promises to the people of Hong Kong. They once more showed the world the common yearning for liberty that unites us all."
"It’s time to remember who we are. We are Americans: We treat each other with dignity, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor."
"Es hora de recordar quiénes somos. Somos estadounidenses: nos tratamos con dignidad, no dejamos a nadie atrás y no le damos cabida al odio."
"I’m proud to stand in solidarity with @CWAUnion workers who walked off the job last night. @ATT must respect workers' rights, negotiate in good faith, and work to secure a fair contract."
"A year ago, we lost a true patriot, a hero, and to me—a friend. John McCain's character, courage, and honor made him a giant among all of us. His deep, unshakeable belief in the soul of America and our values inspired us all and provided hope to the world. I miss him every day."
"La emergencia climática que enfrentamos no solo afecta nuestro medio ambiente, sino que también amenaza nuestra salud, seguridad nacional y bienestar económico. Necesitamos tomar medidas urgentes y drásticas para abordarlo ya, lo que haré como presidente."
"America was built on a simple proposition: all men — and women — are created equal. We haven't lived up to that promise for most, but haven't stopped trying. As we celebrate the 19th Amendment and #WomensEqualityDay, we must continue our fight to truly achieve equality for all."
"When it comes to meeting the existential crisis of our time, Trump has walked away from the table — literally. If we give Trump four more years, the planet may never recover from his utter disregard for the climate crisis and scientific fact."
The distance Trump has put between the U.S. and the rest of the world on the issues that matter most to Americans couldn't be more clear. There is no more telling metaphor for this administration's abdication of American leadership than the empty chair at the G-7 climate meeting.
"After three days, we have even more evidence of how President Trump's disastrous foreign policy has left the U.S. isolated. Rather than looking to America for vision, our closest democratic allies sought to manage and mitigate the damage Trump might do at this year's G-7."
"He honorably served our nation in uniform and in Congress, he would make his home proud every single day. I admire Dan and am thrilled to support him."
".@McCreadyForNC is precisely the kind of leader that North Carolina deserves: one who'll put country over party, who's brought jobs to his community, and who will protect coverage for those with preexisting conditions — not dismantle it to cut taxes for the rich."
"64 years ago, 14-year-old Emmett Till was brutally murdered in Mississippi. His death sparked national outrage and served as a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement. It serves as a reminder of the need to reject intolerance in all its forms. We must give hate no safe harbor."
"As so many others have said, cruelty is their point. It is their only point, and it’s all they have to run on: fear, anger, division, and cruelty. We must restore the soul of our nation."
We are running out of words to condemn the inhumanity of this administration. An administration that pulls children from the arms of their parents and stalks families in their neighborhoods will now deport children who are in life-saving treatment for dire conditions like cancer.
"There is no national security justification for further traumatizing sick kids at their most vulnerable. Like all bullies, Trump is purposefully targeting the little guys—but I would have thought even he would understand that kids with cancer and cystic fibrosis were off-limits."
No sabemos ya qué decir para condenar la inhumanidad de esta administración que arranca niños de los brazos de sus padres y acosa a las familias en sus vecindarios. Ahora deportará a niños que están recibiendo tratamientos de vida o muerte por afecciones graves.
"No hay justificación para traumatizar aún más a los niños enfermos en sus momentos más vulnerables. Como todo abusón, Trump está acosando a los más débiles, pero atacar a niños con cáncer y fibrosis quística es intolerable."
"Como tantos otros han dicho, la crueldad es su meta. Es su única meta, y es lo único que tienen para postularse: el miedo, la ira, la división y la crueldad. Debemos restaurar el alma de nuestra nación."
"This can’t just be a campaign to beat Donald Trump. This has to be a movement grounded in the values and ideals that define our nation best: honesty, decency, treating everyone with dignity and respect, and giving hate no safe harbor.

That’s who we are as Americans."
"Esta no es solo una campaña para vencer a Donald Trump - es un movimiento basado en los valores que definen nuestra nación: la honestidad, la decencia, y el tratar a todos con dignidad y respeto, mientras le damos la espalda al odio. Eso es lo que somos como estadounidenses."
"@GovernorBullock Thanks for the recommendation, @GovernorBullock! I’d love to try it next time I’m in Decorah."
"Obamacare covered 20 million additional Americans, protects over 100 million with pre-existing conditions, and allows young adults to stay on their parents’ coverage until age 26.

We can’t afford to tear it down and start over. We should protect and build on it."
"I’m heartbroken, sickened, &amp; angry. Weeks after the horror in El Paso, another community in Texas has been terrorized by gun violence. Enough. We must end this epidemic.

@DrBiden &amp; I send our thoughts to those affected &amp; thank our law enforcement who responded at great risk."
"Les Gelb was a giant of American foreign policy, and several generations of thinkers and policy makers owe their success to Les' mentorship and intellectual generosity. @DrBiden and I send our deepest condolences to Judy, Adam, Caroline, Alison and all his grandchildren."
"It has been 186 days since the House passed the bipartisan universal background check bill. 
 
@Senatemajldr Mitch McConnell and the Senate should pass it immediately.
 
Lives are at stake."
"Together, we will beat the @NRA. We will end this gun violence epidemic."
"This Labor Day, when you cross paths with someone working a job that makes your day-to-day life better—and I promise you, it will happen many times today—tell them ""thank you.""
 
Tell them you appreciate the work that they do. That it matters to you, and to your community."
"Say thank you to the people who build our roads and bridges. Keep our water systems working. Teach our kids and take care of the sick among us. Race into our burning buildings. Grow our food, build our cars, and pick up the garbage off our streets."
Say thank you—because these are the people who make America run. Not the Wall Street bankers. Not the CEOs or hedge fund managers. Ordinary people doing extraordinary things.
"The 40-hour workweek
Minimum wage
Overtime pay

They’re all because of unions. It’s time we recognize that."
"Four years of Betsy DeVos is more than enough.

As president, I’ll name a Secretary of Education who is actually an educator."
Hey everyone — @TeamJoe here! We’re taking over for tonight’s CNN #ClimateTownHall. We’ll keep you updated as Joe Biden takes the stage to discuss his plans to combat climate change.
"We can't turn a blind eye to the way in which environmental burdens are distributed unevenly along racial and socioeconomic lines.

Biden will right these wrongs and stand up to fossil fuel companies  who disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities."
"If Joe Biden was president, there would be no empty chair at the G-7. #ClimateTownHall"
"The Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face. It powerfully captures two core truths:

1️⃣ This is an existential crisis requiring immediate, ambitious action.
2️⃣ Our environment and economy are connected.

#ClimateTownHall"
"The clean energy economy of the future presents an enormous opportunity. President Biden will create 10 million well-paying jobs in the United States that will grow a stronger, more inclusive middle class in communities across the country. #ClimateTownHall"
"Climate change is an urgent threat to our environment, health, economy, and national security. There’s no time for on-the-job training. We need a leader who is ready on day one — and that’s Joe Biden. #ClimateTownHall"
"President Trump continues to:

🔴 Deny the science in front of his own eyes
🔴 Attack the progress made by the Obama-Biden Administration
🔴 Spew lies like “windmills cause cancer”

Defeating him is essential to making any progress on climate change. #ClimateTownHall"
That’s all we have for tonight’s CNN #ClimateTownHall! Make sure to follow @TeamJoe to stay up-to-date on everything happening on the campaign.
"Two years ago, President Trump attempted to end DACA—throwing lives into chaos &amp; forcing our DREAMers to live in fear as the Supreme Court decides their fate. It's cruel.
 
DREAMers are Americans. It's time for Congress to keep our promise to them &amp; provide a path to citizenship."
"Hace dos años, el presidente Trump intentó terminar con DACA, obligando a nuestros DREAMers a vivir con miedo y caos. Es cruel.

Los soñadores son estadounidenses. Es hora de que el Congreso cumpla con nuestra promesa y les proporcione un camino hacia la ciudadanía."
"President Trump stokes the flames of hatred, coddles white nationalists with messages of support, and preys on our deepest divisions. If we give him four more years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.

We can’t let that happen."
"Obamacare prohibits insurers from denying coverage for the 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions.

President Trump wants to gut the ACA and tear that protection away. We can’t forget that."
"Mexico isn’t paying for the wall.
American military families are.
 
China isn’t paying for the tariffs.
American farmers and manufacturers are.
 
The American people continue to foot the bill for President Trump’s senseless political games."
"I support @McCreadyForNC because of his honorable service to our nation &amp; because of his values: he'll fight to protect North Carolinian’s health care &amp; take on prescription drug companies.

If his opponent has his way, 44,000 people in #NC09 stand to lose their health coverage."
"There is no distinction between mental health and physical health — it’s health. On #WorldSuicidePreventionDay, we must recommit to eliminating the stigma around mental health and ensuring everyone has access to the care they need."
"Puerto Rico is still rebuilding from the devastation of Hurricane Maria. Now, instead of supporting the recovery, President Trump is defunding $400 million in planned military projects in Puerto Rico to build his wall. It's unacceptable."
"Puerto Rico aún se está recuperando de la devastación del huracán María. Ahora, en lugar de apoyar la reconstrucción, Trump está desviando $400 millones de dólares para su construir su muro que estaban planificados para proyectos militares en Puerto Rico. Es inaceptable."
America’s strength is and has always been rooted in our diversity. Immigrants have always made us stronger. Donald Trump doesn’t get that.
La fuerza de los Estados Unidos está y siempre ha estado arraigada en nuestra diversidad. Los inmigrantes siempre nos han hecho más fuertes. Donald Trump no entiende eso.
"Each 9/11, we remember that resilience and courage live in the hearts of all Americans—especially our brave first responders. 18 years later, we reaffirm that Americans will never bend to terrorism, and we will never forget those we lost."
"All workers deserve the right to bargain for good wages, benefits and working conditions—including gig workers. That is why I'm pleased the CA Legislature passed AB5. As president, I will enact a federal law to ensure gig workers get the full protections they deserve."
"Senators Sanders and Warren would put an end to the employer-sponsored and union-negotiated plans that more than 100 million Americans currently have.

That's a non-starter for us.

#DemDebate"
"Senator Sanders' Medicare for All plan would require raising taxes on the middle class.

Joe Biden:
""There will be a deductible—in your paycheck.""

#DemDebate"
Attempts to compare President Trump and President Obama on immigration are far-fetched. #DemDebate
"The Obama-Biden Administration did not conduct workplace raids—in fact, it ended them. #DemDebate"
The Obama-Biden Administration did NOT terrorize families and indiscriminately target people who had lived here for years. #DemDebate
"The Obama-Biden Administration did NOT prosecute asylum seekers, or those coming here in search of opportunity. #DemDebate"
"If we don't write the rules to protect American labor and the environment, China will—and not in a way that advances our values. When it comes to trade, we've got to work with allies—not against them. #DemDebate"
It's past time to end the war in Afghanistan. Joe Biden has long believed that we should narrow our focus to counter-terrorism operations. We can't keep spending tens of billions of dollars every year to sustain a stalemate. #DemDebate
It’s important to have a plan that meets the urgency of this climate crisis. But it’s going to take more than plans—it’s going to take leadership. Biden has the relationships with key foreign leaders and the experience to get this done. #DemDebate
Joe Biden knows how to rally the world to meet the climate crisis because he’s done it before. Biden worked alongside President Obama to get the world—including China—to agree to the Paris Accord; and he will be prepared on day one of his presidency to push beyond those goals.
"Throughout his career, Joe Biden has:

Fought redlining.

Fought school lines drawn to keep races &amp; classes separate.

Fought to put public housing in white neighborhoods.

Fought for more resources to prosecute hate crimes.

#DemDebate"
"K-12 education isn’t enough. Many parents don’t have access to early educational resources for their kids. A Biden administration will provide Universal Pre-K, to help ensure that no child’s future is determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability. #DemDebate"
"There was only one candidate onstage who helped create—and then signed—a Pledge for Election Integrity, promising to use no disinformation or tolerate outside interference in the election or our democracy. #DemDebate"
We need a president who can deliver progress on the most pressing issues facing Americans. Joe Biden will be that president. #DemDebate
There was only one candidate onstage who has flipped a Senator's vote to help pass once-in-a-century health care reform. #DemDebate
Ten candidates took the stage tonight. But there was only one candidate onstage who has defeated the NRA twice and passed an assault weapons ban. #DemDebate
There was only one candidate onstage who stood at President Obama’s side to lead a nation out of a recession and put middle-class Americans back to work. #DemDebate
"There was only one candidate onstage who has the experience—from Scranton, PA, to the White House—to hit the ground running as President. And that candidate is Joe Biden. #DemDebate"
"That’s all we have for tonight, folks! Thanks for following along. Make sure to follow @TeamJoe to stay up-to-date on what’s happening on the campaign. #DemDebate"
I’m running for president because we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. It’s time for us to pick our heads up and remember who we are — this is the United States of America. There’s not a single thing we can’t do.
"Debemos hacer todo lo que esté a nuestro alcance para abordar la emergencia climática. Como presidente, trabajaré para convertirnos en una economía de energía limpia con emisiones netas cero para el 2050. Volveremos a liderar el mundo en la lucha contra el cambio climático."
"My North Star as president will be rebuilding the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, we'll make sure everyone comes along."
"Obamacare was a huge step forward—providing protections to over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. We can’t stop there. As president, I’ll protect &amp; build on Obamacare to ensure every American has the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care."
Obamacare fue un gran avance: proporcionó protecciones a más de 100 millones de estadounidenses con afecciones preexistentes. No podemos parar allí. Como presidente protegeré y expandiré Obamacare para garantizar que todos tengamos acceso a atención médica asequible y de calidad.
"Gun violence tragedies are not inevitable. Together, we can end this epidemic."
"America is an idea that has grown stronger through the unique contributions of Hispanic communities. Where would we be without Justice Sonia Sotomayor, César Chávez, @HildaSolis, Dolores Huerta and others who have changed our world for the better? #HispanicHeritageMonth"
"Los Estados Unidos es una idea que se ha fortalecido a través de las contribuciones únicas de la comunidad hispana. ¿Dónde estaríamos sin la juez Sonia Sotomayor, César Chávez, @HildaSolis, Dolores Huerta y otros que han mejorado nuestro mundo? #HerenciaHispana"
"259 days into 2019.

300 mass shootings.

We cannot go on like this."
"Our firefighters and teachers should not be paying a higher tax rate than someone making $50 million a year.

We’ve got to repeal President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy and create a tax code that works for the middle class."
No one should be fired simply because of who they are or who they love. We must pass the Equality Act and ensure LGBTQ Americans are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.
"When domestic abusers have easy access to guns, the result can be fatal. Gov. Sununu should work with the NH legislature to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. 

I wrote &amp; passed the Violence Against Women Act. I’ve taken on the NRA twice — and as president, I’ll do it again."
"We need a president who believes in science over fiction. As president, I will fight for rigorous fuel economy standards that protect our health, our environment, and our economy."
I’m more optimistic about America’s future today than I was when I was first elected to the Senate as a 29-year-old kid. There’s not a single thing we cannot do — if we do it together.
"Wealthy special interests and corporations have dominated our politics for far too long.

It’s time we overturn Citizens United and create a public financing system for our elections."
Our students deserve better than four more years of Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos.
Inspired by the courage and determination of young people across the world as they take to the streets for today’s #ClimateStrike. Climate change is an existential threat that we cannot wait to address. It's up to all of us to take action—future generations are counting on us.
"Saddened to hear of the passing of Maurice Ferré — the father of modern-day Miami. A trailblazer and a true public servant, he paved the way for others as the first Hispanic mayor of Miami. He will be deeply missed. Jill and I are keeping his loved ones in our hearts."
"Happy Homecoming, Delaware State University! I’m biased, but you are the greatest HBCU in the country."
"Let’s be clear, Donald Trump pressured a foreign government to interfere in our elections. It goes against everything the United States stands for.

We must make him a one-term president."
"I’m running for president to restore the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, everyone is going to come along."
"Tonight, you made history, @theebillyporter. And as you did it, you reminded us that there is so much more that unites us than divides us. You blazed a trail that will mean so much to so many young people who can now imagine themselves standing on that stage because of you."
"Republicans should never have allowed the 1994 ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines to expire.

As president, I’ll take on the @NRA once again to ban these weapons of war and get them off our streets."
"Wishing a happy birthday to the rock and roll legend, @springsteen. Your ability to connect with everyday Americans and the issues they face is unrivaled. We are all better off because of your talent, your passion, and your voice."
"I’ve seen firsthand how hard America’s teachers and support staff work with little support and few resources. They deserve better. I’m proud to support Chicago’s educators as they fight for fair wages, full staffing, and smaller class sizes."
The pay gap that Native women face — due to both their gender and the color of their skin — is unacceptable. We must right these wrongs and close the gender pay gap once and for all. #NativeWomensEqualPay
President Trump's actions are an abuse of power. They undermine our national security. They violate the oath of office. If we allow a President to get away with shredding the United States Constitution — that will last forever.
"Donald Trump pressured Ukraine to manufacture a smear against a domestic political opponent — the “transcript” made that clear. It’s an abuse of power that violates the oath of office and undermines our democracy.

Congress must hold him accountable."
"We have a President who believes there is no limit to his power, who believes he can do anything and get away with it, and who believes he is above the law.

This isn’t a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. This is a national issue."
"Every day it becomes clearer, the core values of our nation — our very democracy — are at risk with President Trump in the White House.

We must hold Trump accountable. We cannot let him get away with shredding our Constitution."
I believe our elections should be decided by the American people — not foreign governments.
It’s clear — we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. It’s time to pick our heads up and show the world who we are. We are the United States of America — there is nothing beyond our capacity.
"We need to take the next step in improving our nation’s health care system. The Affordable Care Act was an historic first step — we need to build on it, not start from scratch. I’ll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure everyone has access to affordable, quality health care."
"President Trump is trying to hijack this election to distract from how he has turned his back on America's families: sabotaging our health care, prioritizing tax cuts for the super-wealthy, and rolling back our progress on climate change.

We won't let him get away with it."
"We can combat climate change.
We can end our gun violence epidemic.
We can ensure every American has access to quality, affordable health care.

It’s all within our reach if we unite this country. There’s not a single thing we cannot do — together."
President Trump is trying to hijack this election. We cannot let him get away with it.
"Being middle class isn’t a number. It’s a value set. It’s about the issues that matter to every American family: a good education, economic opportunity, access to quality, affordable health care.

We've got to rebuild the middle class and, this time, ensure everyone comes along."
"Two years ago, we watched in horror as 58 precious lives were cut short in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. As we remember those we lost in Las Vegas, we must honor them with action. We cannot let the scourge of gun violence tear our communities apart any longer."
"President Trump asked a foreign government to interfere in our elections, and now he's spending $10 million on attack ads against me. It's clear that he is trying to influence the primary and pick his opponent.

Why? Because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum."
".@DrBiden and I are sending our best wishes to @BernieSanders, Jane, and the whole Sanders family. Anyone who knows Bernie understands what a force he is. We are confident that he will have a full and speedy recovery and look forward to seeing him on the trail soon."
"En el 1994, el senador Feinstein y yo dirigimos la lucha para prohibir las armas de fuego para asalto y las revistas de alta capacidad. Luchamos contra el @NRA y los vencimos.

Como presidente, volveré a prohibir estas armas de guerra. Las sacaremos de nuestras calles."
"52 years ago, Thurgood Marshall became the first African American Supreme Court Justice. A legal giant in the struggle for civil rights—he relentlessly pushed America closer to our promise of liberty, equality, and justice for all. His voice forever changed the course of history."
The idea of Donald Trump attacking anyone’s integrity is a joke.
"It has been 219 days since the House passed the bipartisan universal background check bill. Every day since, @senatemajldr McConnell has refused to bring it up for a vote.

Enough. How many more Americans must die for Senate Republicans to stand up to the @NRA and take action?"
Donald Trump is the definition of corruption.
He does not understand the immense responsibility demanded of all those who hold the office of the president of the United States. He sees only the power – and how it can benefit just one person: Donald Trump.
"Our first president, George Washington, famously could not tell a lie. Trump seemingly cannot tell the truth — about anything. He slanders anyone he sees as a threat. It's why is he is frantically pushing flat-out lies, debunked conspiracy theories and smears against me."
"It’s the same cynical playbook he returns to again and again. But this time it won’t work, because the American people know me—and they know him. I will put the integrity of my whole career in public service to this nation up against Trump’s lack of integrity any day of the week."
"While the House does its job on impeachment, I’m going to stay focused on what matters: improving the lives of Americans and fighting to ensure that the United States is once again the leader of the free world."
"And to Trump and those who facilitate his abuses of power, and all the special interests funding his attacks against me: Please know that I’m not going anywhere. You won’t destroy me, and you won’t destroy my family. And come November 2020, I intend to beat you like a drum."
"Jill and I are devastated to hear about last night’s shooting in Kansas City. No one should ever have to fear that they, or their loved ones, may not return home due to senseless violence.

We must come together as a country to put an end to these tragedies once and for all."
Elena @De11eDonne is the pride of Delaware. Wishing her well as she recovers — we need more professional athletes like her sharing their support for inclusive sports. I'm looking forward to seeing her back on the court soon.
President Trump continuously dishonors everything it means to hold the office of President of the United States of America. We must make him a one-term president.
"We cannot, and will not, stand for President Trump’s corruption. We will beat him like a drum."
"As president, I will make passing the Equality Act a top legislative priority. A Biden administration won’t rest until we truly achieve full equality, and everyone is treated with dignity and respect under the law."
"This week, the Trump Administration is set to argue before the Supreme Court that it’s legal to discriminate against someone simply because of who they are or whom they love. It’s a dangerous attack on the civil rights of LGBTQ Americans and everything we stand for."
"A president should use the full might of the executive branch to secure justice, dignity, and safety for all. Instead, President Trump does the opposite — callously exerting his power over the most vulnerable.

We must send a clear message: We will not stand for this."
"Firefighters and teachers should not pay a higher tax rate than the wealthiest in our country. As president, I will reverse President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy and create a tax code that works for the middle class.

It’s time we reward work, not just wealth."
".@DrBiden calls community colleges America’s best kept secret — she's right. A Biden administration will invest in these institutions, providing every American with two years of community college or other high-quality training programs without debt."
"A Biden administration will take concrete action to address the student debt crisis in our country. We will expand access to Pell Grants, more than halve income-based payments on undergraduate federal student loans, and make student loan forgiveness work for public servants."
"Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions play a vital role in our communities. A Biden administration will invest $70 billion in these institutions to improve affordability, build high tech labs and facilities, and support student success."
"No one should live in fear of being fired because of who they are or whom they love. We must stand up to President Trump’s relentless attacks on LGBTQ rights and continue the fight for full equality—because every American deserves to live open, proud, and free. #RiseUpOct8"
Jill and I wish Jewish communities around the world an easy fast as they gather to observe Yom Kippur. The Day of Atonement is an important reminder of the obligation we all share to reflect on our actions and recommit to our values in the year ahead. L’Shana Tovah.
"I have spent my entire career fighting the abuse of power.

Donald Trump has spent his entire career abusing his power."
"Jill and I send our best wishes to those taking part in the Hindu festival of Navratri. As the nine days of celebration come to a close, let us remain optimistic of the triumph of good over evil and the opportunity of new beginnings."
"With his words and with his actions, President Trump has indicted himself.

He should be impeached."
"Two days ago, Trump impulsively gave Turkey a green light to invade Syria, blindsiding our military. Today, we see the consequences—Turkish forces attacking the fighters that helped us take on ISIS. It’s a betrayal, takes pressure off the terrorist threat, &amp; leaves us less safe."
"Last night, history was made in the birthplace of the civil rights movement, when Steven Reed became the first African American mayor of Montgomery."
"Only a little farther north, Timothy Ragland won his race to become both the youngest and first African American mayor of Talladega. I'm confident they will serve the people of Alabama well."
"But that's not all — he betrayed our brave troops, who sacrificed alongside them. He betrayed our word as a nation — raising doubts among our allies around the world about America's security commitments."
"Trump made this decision on a whim, after a phone call with Turkish President Erdogan. There was no process. No consultation with our military, our diplomats, or our allies. Trump got rolled, plain and simple, because he has no idea what he's doing."
Looking forward to joining @AndersonCooper at tonight’s #EqualityTownHall to discuss the work that remains in the fight for LGBTQ rights. Tune in to CNN at 8PM ET to watch live.
There is no distinction between mental health and physical health — it’s health. Period. We've got to combat the stigma and ensure everyone has access to the care they need and deserve. #WorldMentalHealthDay
Honored to be asked a question at tonight's #EqualityTownHall by my friend Judy Shepard. It was a privilege to work with her to secure the passage of legislation that extended our hate crimes laws to crimes based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
"I spent my night at the HRC forum talking about the fundamental respect every human being deserves. You spent yours showing how little respect for anyone else you have. America is so much stronger than your weakness, @realDonaldTrump."
"To LGBTQ people suffering persecution anywhere: the American people are on your side. And as president, I will ensure the U.S. leads the world to defend human rights for all."
Today is a reminder to every girl on the planet: nothing is beyond your capacity or capability. And all of us must work to ensure that girls around the world have the chance to participate fully in society and that their rights are respected. #DayoftheGirl
"Living open and proud is a daily act of bravery — bravery that resides in the heart of every single LGBTQ individual.

To those who have come out and to those who haven’t, know that I’m proud of you. You are loved and you are accepted just as you are. #ComingOutDay"
"Let me make something clear to President Trump: I’m not going anywhere.

You’re not going to destroy me. And you’re not going to destroy my family. I don’t care how dirty the attacks get."
"We believe Americans should decide American elections. But Trump will do anything to get re-elected, including violating the most basic norms of our democracy. It's dangerous.

We cannot give him four more years in the White House."
"President Trump believes he can and will get away with anything he does. We all laughed when he said he could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it.

Now, he is shooting holes in our Constitution. We cannot let him get away with it."
"I was proud to work with Matthew’s parents, Judy and Dennis, to extend our hate crimes law to cover sexual orientation and gender identity. But there’s still more work to be done — we can’t rest until every single American can live open and proud without fear."
"21 years ago, Matthew Shepard passed away after a brutal anti-gay hate crime — an attack that shook the conscience of our nation. As we honor his memory, we must remember that members of the LGBTQ community — especially trans women of color — are still targeted with violence."
@SarahEMcBride @MaraKeisling @NCTEActionFund Thanks Sarah. I'm proud of you and so is Beau.
Donald Trump is a threat to our democracy. He must be impeached.
"On #IndigenousPeoplesDay, we recognize the resiliency of indigenous communities and celebrate their rich contributions to society—while recommitting to the work that remains to come to terms with our past as a nation, to honor our promises, and work to right our wrongs."
Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history.
"Overturning Citizens United isn’t enough. Ridding our politics of big money and corporate special interests demands more. We must go further.

I will introduce a constitutional amendment to get all private dollars out of our federal elections."
"Philadelphia's office cleaners work hard every day to keep the city's buildings clean. They deserve the dignity that comes with a living wage, access to health care, and a secure retirement. I stand with @32BJSEIU cleaners in their fight for a fair contract. #BuildingJustice"
"This election is about you. Your children. Your family. And you can’t wait for a president fighting for you when it comes to health care, or jobs, or education, or guns, or climate. The world can’t wait for America to once again lead a stable, peaceful international order."
"Fixing what's broken in this country will take vision—and yes, it will take plans. But that’s not enough.

It also takes the proven ability to get it done. And there is no one on tonight's stage who has a stronger record of passing important, consequential legislation than I do."
"From the Voting Rights Act renewal, to the ban on assault weapons, to the Violence Against Women Act, to Obamacare, to the Recovery Act that kept us from sliding into a Depression, I’ve delivered progress for you.

I know what it takes to get it done."
"Folks, we have to do more than beat Donald Trump.

We have to beat him like a drum.

When I take the #DemDebate stage tonight, I'm going to show you that I'm the best candidate to do just that.

Let's go."
"For days, pundits have let Donald Trump define the conversation around tonight's #DemDebate.

Well, Trump doesn't get to pick the Democratic nominee. And I’m not going to be distracted by all his lies, smears, distortions, and name-calling. He’s picked a fight with the wrong guy."
"“Russia, if you’re listening…”

“I would like you to do us a favor…” to Ukraine’s president

“China should start an investigation.”

Our President has asked three foreign powers to intervene in our elections on his behalf — and those are just the ones we know about! #DemDebate"
"On day one, Joe Biden will move to:

✅ Eliminate the Trump tax cut for the super-wealthy
✅ Eliminate the unjustified loopholes in our tax code
✅ Use that money to invest in America’s future

#DemDebate"
"Our firefighters and teachers work tirelessly to make our communities safer, better places to live. They should not pay a higher tax rate than the super-wealthy. #DemDebate"
"As president, Joe Biden will repeal Trump’s tax cuts for corporations and the super-wealthy, and build a tax code that rewards work, not just wealth. #DemDebate"
Donald Trump betrayed our partners in the Syrian Democratic Forces and put at risk our gains against ISIS. This is a disaster of his own making. #DemDebate
"The United States has a vital national interest in Syria to ensure the lasting defeat of ISIS. We know that this terrorist group plotted to attack our homeland in the past, and we cannot let that threat re-emerge. #DemDebate"
"“We have an erratic, crazy President who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy.”

#DemDebate"
"Roe v. Wade is the law of the land. Period.
 
As president, Joe Biden will stand up to attacks on a woman’s constitutional right to choose and enshrine Roe into federal law. #DemDebate"
"Let’s put this in perspective: if you eliminate every single solitary soldier, tank, satellite, nuclear weapon, eliminate the Pentagon and it would only pay for 4 months of Medicare for All. 4 months.

Where do the other 8 months come from? Your paycheck. #DemDebate"
"The Kurds were integral in helping us defeat ISIS — and too many lost their lives. Now, President Trump has abandoned them. It's shameful."
"Proud to stand with @CTULocal1, @SEIU73, and every teacher and support staff member striking today for better staffing and quality schools for our students. It's time we support all workers with the pay and dignity they deserve. #FairContractNow"
"Every young person deserves to be affirmed and accepted exactly as they are — regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. Today on #SpiritDay and every day, we must ensure LGBTQ youth hear that message loud and clear."
Donald Trump is the most reckless and incompetent Commander-in-Chief we’ve ever had.
"Eliminate all private dollars from federal elections.

Overturn Citizens United and end dark money groups.

Ban lobbyists from donating to candidates they lobby.

It's time we ensure our government works for the people — not just the powerful."
"From day one, a Biden administration will be focused on rebuilding the backbone of our country — the middle class. And this time, we’ll make sure everyone comes along — regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability."
"Congratulations for making history, @Astro_Christina and @Astro_Jessica. Because of you, every girl knows that even the stars are not beyond her reach. #AllWomanSpaceWalk"
".@realDonaldTrump, we have a message for you: release your tax returns or shut up about corruption.

Get yours today:"
"15 years ago, I worked to help pass the North Korea Human Rights Act. We made our values clear to the brutal regime in Pyongyang. Trump has instead made excuses for the dictator in the North and refuses to appoint a special envoy for human rights in NK. It is disgraceful."
"Our firefighters and teachers should not be paying a higher tax rate than the super-wealthy. We’ve got to rebuild the middle class and, this time, make sure everyone comes along."
Hosting the G7 at Trump’s hotel? A president should never be able to use the office for personal gain.
"Thoughts and prayers won’t end our gun violence epidemic. 

It’s past time we take on the @NRA and pass common-sense gun safety reform — that starts with banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and requiring universal background checks."
"I’m not going to be distracted by all of President Trump's lies, smears, distortions, and name-calling. I’m going to stay focused on the issues that matter to you—because action cannot wait when it comes to health care, or jobs, or education, or guns, or climate."
"Donald Trump has asked three foreign governments to interfere in our elections on his behalf. In full view of the American people, he has violated his oath of office and betrayed our nation.

He must be impeached."
"There used to be a basic bargain in America—when your company did well, you shared in the prosperity. We must restore that bargain &amp; stand up to corporate profiteering.

I support @Teamsters25 as they strike against @RepublicService for a living wage, health care, and pensions."
"The moral obligation of our time is to restore, rebuild, and respect the backbone of America—the middle class. That mission will be my North Star as president."
"I'm proud to stand with @seiuhcpa and Regional Hospital of Scranton workers in their fight for higher wages, access to affordable health insurance, and a fair contract that invests in the future of their hospital."
"As president, I would press for dialogue to prevent further violence and instability. Investing in Haiti’s prosperity and security is in the national security interest of the United States."
"At a time when labor is under attack and Trump's reckless trade wars threaten millions more farms and families around the country, @TimRyan has been a clear voice for those at risk of being left behind. He'll continue to be a fierce force for them in Congress."
The powerful gun lobby has controlled our politics for far too long. Enough is enough. We the people own this country — not the @NRA.
"Donald Trump lacks the moral authority to lead our country. Every day he spends in the White House, he further debases the values and ideals of our nation. We must make him a one-term president."
Congressman Elijah Cummings was a lion of democracy and a powerful ally in the fight for the soul of our nation. I am honored to have served alongside him and known him as a friend. May his passion and purpose live on as he rests in heavenly peace.
"Today, we remember the lives taken one year ago at the Tree of Life Synagogue. We must constantly strive to live up to the American ideal that we're all created equal, while facing the harsh reality that hate has long torn us apart. The battle isn't over. We must end this hate."
Tonight on @60minutes I’ll lay out what I believe we need to do to ensure that America’s word means something again on the world stage. Tune in at 7pm ET.
Donald Trump has no strategy for securing our nation against terrorist threats. He has no strategy for anything. Every day that he directs American national security is a dangerous day for the United States.
"In a Biden administration, our:

- Secretary of Education will be an educator
- EPA Administrator will know climate change is real
- Attorney General will defend the Constitution, not the president"
"Filipino-American History Month is an important opportunity to honor the rich history of the Filipino-American community, including the legacy of brave Filipino veterans who fought in World War II, and all the ways they strengthen our nation."
"I welcome the House’s passage of H Res 296, which recognizes and condemns the Armenian Genocide of 1915-23. By acknowledging this genocide we honor the memory of its victims and vow: never again."
"For too long, corporations have stifled workers’ right to organize and collectively bargain for the pay and benefits they deserve.

That ends with a Biden administration.

We will hold corporations and executives personally accountable for interfering with the rights of workers."
"Proud to stand in solidarity with @TWULocal100 and @Transportworker in their fight for a fair contract. The 40,000+ bus and subway workers who move New York deserve the dignity that comes with fair wages, good benefits, and job security. #TWUrally2019"
The American people can’t afford four more years of Donald Trump’s art of no deals.
The next president will inherit a world in disarray. There’s no time for on-the-job training — I’ll be ready on day one.
"In the wake of tragedy in his hometown, @BetoORourke responded with compassion and leadership, looking into the eyes of people who just lost loved ones and pledging his total resolve. His passion for solving our gun crisis has been inspiring to anyone who has seen him."
Progress is bringing people together to get real results. It’s not accusing someone of being a Republican because they don’t share your approach to achieving universal health care. I know what it takes to get things done. I fought to pass Obamacare — I will fight to build on it.
"We have one year to determine the mark Donald Trump will leave on our country. There's too much at stake to take the next year for granted. We must work together to take back the White House, win the Senate, hold the House and elect Democrats down the ballot. #OneYearOneTeam"
"In one year, we will give Trump a nickname of his own: Former President Donald Trump."
"A country that ignores the threat to the very survival of this planet isn’t just troubled — it’s morally bankrupt.

We must get the climate change denier out of the White House and take urgent action to address the climate emergency."
"Proud to stand with folks in Las Vegas fighting against a proposed ordinance that effectively criminalizes homelessness. Like we did in the Obama-Biden Administration, we should focus on providing housing first and work to find long-term solutions to end homelessness."
"Trump's Cuba policy hurts families on &amp; off the island. Administrations of both parties have supported family reunification, and I support @DebbieforFL &amp; @DonnaShalala's work to reunite Cuban families. As president, I will reinstate the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program."
"Ten years ago today at Fort Hood. Two years ago in Sutherland Springs. In total, 39 lives taken because of our gun violence epidemic. We must honor the memory of those we lost with concrete action on gun safety reform."
Congratulations to Governor-Elect @AndyBeshearKY on his hard-earned victory. He has served the people of Kentucky well as attorney general — the Commonwealth is in good hands with him in the governor's office.
"Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he proves how unfit he is to lead our country. We cannot give him eight years in the White House."
"Proud to stand with the @GeneralMills @RWDSU members in their fight for a fair contract. Every worker deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages, good benefits, and job security."
Getting the Violence Against Women Act passed is one of the highlights of my whole career. Now Senate Republicans are refusing to reauthorize it. To all the advocates and survivors speaking out - your voice makes all the difference. It always has. So keep it up. #VAWA4ALL
I led the successful fight in the 1980s to stop Jeff Sessions’ nomination for a federal judgeship. I hope the people of Alabama will stop him from rejoining the Senate next year.
"Every kid deserves a quality education and every family deserves to live in a safe, healthy community. That's why I support the California #SchoolsAndCommunitiesFirst initiative that will make corporations pay their fair share and invest in our communities to help them thrive."
"25 years ago, California approved Prop. 187 — a measure designed to strategically disenfranchise immigrant communities by stripping away access to health care and education."
"This anniversary is not only a reminder of the cruelty these communities, especially Latinos, have tirelessly faced, but it is also a testament to their steadfast resilience in the face of prejudice to spark change, in California and across our country."
"We have to start rewarding work, not wealth. As president, I will build a stronger, more inclusive middle class — not cut taxes for the super wealthy."
"Health care is a right. Every American should have the peace of mind that comes from access to affordable health care, and we can get there by protecting and building on Obamacare."
"The ACA was, and is, a big deal. It took generations of presidents trying to expand health care access, and President Obama and I got it done. 

I’ll fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to tear it down—Republican or Democrat."
"Together we can, and will, make Donald Trump a one-term president."
Looking forward to joining @ErinBurnett for tonight’s town hall in Iowa to discuss what’s at stake in this election and why I’m running for president. Tune in to @CNN at 9 PM ET to watch live.
"As president, I will ensure DREAMers are recognized as the Americans they are. In the meantime, the Supreme Court should overturn Donald Trump’s cruel decision so that DREAMers can continue to live fully in the only country they have ever known. Their #HomeIsHere."
"First Trump gave a green light to Erdogan to ethnically cleanse Kurds who helped us defeat ISIS. Now he welcomes Erdogan with open arms and sweetheart deals. It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that, once again, Trump’s personal interests, not US interests, are driving his policy."
The American people deserve to know what Donald Trump is hiding in his tax returns.
"The Affordable Care Act
An assault weapons ban
The Violence Against Women Act

There is no one in this race who has a stronger record of passing important, consequential legislation than I do. I know what it takes to get the job done."
"Another school shooting. How long will we go on like this? No kid should fear their safety in school &amp; no parent should worry whether their kid will come home.

Our hearts go out to Santa Clarita, but prayers aren't enough. We need real gun reform to make our schools safer."
"We will beat the @NRA.

We will pass common-sense reforms. 

We must end our gun violence epidemic."
This ugly ideology has no place in America—it is both offensive and dangerous that it has taken root in the White House. Stephen Miller must go now. Then we must ensure Trump is shown the door in 2020—and that his hateful ideology never again is given a voice in the Oval Office.
"President Trump continues to undermine registered apprenticeships—programs that provide a path to the middle class &amp; a good union job. As president, I will work to save these important programs &amp; ensure every American has the skills they need to get ahead. #SaveApprenticeshipWeek"
"I am deeply concerned about the unjust detainment of Jose Daniel Ferrer, a voice for change in Cuba, by the Cuban government. Ferrer must be released at once."
"The Foreign Service Officers who testified this week represent the best of America. They deserve our support &amp; thanks for their work to advance American interests, not the scorn &amp; harassment they get from the President. Every day, Donald Trump reminds us he's unfit to serve."
"Trump's intervention in the American military justice system to pardon service members accused or convicted of war crimes betrays the rule of law, the values that make our country exceptional &amp; the men and women who wear the uniform honorably. He is not fit to command our troops."
"I’m running for president to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, we have to bring everyone along regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability."
This election is about the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul.
"Something is wrong in America when the average Latina makes just over half what the average non-Latino white man makes. Donald Trump has undone much of what we did in the White House to fix the gender pay gap. When I'm president, I'll work to right that wrong. #LatinaEqualPayDay"
"On this Transgender Day of Remembrance, we honor the memory of those we’ve lost—at least 22 trans and gender non-conforming people killed this year—and recommit to ridding this hate-filled violence from our society. Everyone deserves to live open and proud and free without fear."
"This election is about the soul of our nation—and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. He has no regard for our Constitution and violates everything we stand for. It’s not hyperbole to say that this is about saving America.
 
We have to decide who we are and who we want to be."
"When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where no one has to worry about whether they can afford health care.

I fought like hell to get Obamacare passed and I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has led a transformation of our health care system."
"When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about a country where we can look our kids in the eye and tell them: “You will be safe at school.”

I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who has taken on the @NRA and won twice—and I can’t wait to do it again."
"@NRA When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the responsibility we have to our children to take on the threat of climate change.
 
I’m the only one on tonight’s stage who helped secure the Paris Agreement and the largest-ever U.S. investment in clean energy."
"@NRA When I talk about the soul of this nation—I’m talking about the values America stands for on the world stage. Values that have been tarnished by Trump.

I’m the only one on tonight's stage ready to rebuild our global reputation and restore our moral leadership on day one."
"@NRA The fight ahead of us is about more than just having plans. It’s about repairing our soul—and it will take someone with the proven ability to bring people together.

I've done it before—and at tonight's #DemDebate, I'm going to show you why I'm the best candidate to do it again."
"I’m about to take the stage for tonight’s #DemDebate, so I’m passing the account over to my team. They’ll keep you in the loop throughout the night on everything happening. Follow along here and on @TeamJoe for updates. Tune in to @MSNBC at 9 PM ET to watch live!"
"Joe Biden has the quickest, most effective plan to achieve universal health care coverage - at 1/30th the cost of Medicare for All. And, he doesn’t get rid of employer-based health care. #DemDebate"
"In a Biden Administration, plans with lower deductibles will become more affordable, coverage will be extended to more Americans, and the roughly 5 million low-income Americans who were denied Medicaid by their governors and/or state legislatures will finally gain coverage."
The next president will face a monumental task cleaning up Trump's mess. Joe Biden is the best candidate on the debate stage to immediately get to work restoring America’s place in the world. Because he’s done it before. #DemDebate
Joe Biden is a statesman with decades of experience on the world stage who can repair our relationships around the world and is ready to command our armed forces on day one. #DemDebate
"More than anything, we need a president who can deliver on climate change. Joe Biden has a proven record of bringing people together to achieve real, lasting solutions — at home and abroad. #DemDebate"
"Under President Trump, the North Korean nuclear threat is getting worse, not better. As President, Joe Biden will coordinate closely with our allies and hold China accountable for not putting pressure on North Korea. He'll see Kim Jong Un for what he is — a ruthless tyrant."
"Human rights should be at the core of our engagement with the world--not the periphery. As president, Joe Biden will hold accountable Saudi Arabia, China, and every nation that violates the human rights of their citizens. #DemDebate"
"Roe v. Wade is the law of the land. Period.

As president, Joe Biden will stand up to attacks on a woman’s constitutional right to choose and enshrine Roe into federal law. #DemDebate"
That’s all we have! Thanks for tagging along for tonight’s #DemDebate. Make sure to follow @TeamJoe to stay up-to-date on everything happening on the campaign.
The White House is not a place for on-the-job training. I'll be ready on day one.
"It’s clear that Donald Trump has abused the power of the presidency. Full stop.

He is the most corrupt president in modern American history."
"We need to build an economy that reflects our values.

My administration will reverse the Trump tax cuts for the super-wealthy and corporations. We'll then use that money to build a stronger, more inclusive middle class."
Corruption is Donald Trump’s middle name.
"Our hearts go out to the families of Iranian protesters who were killed this past week. Iranians, like people everywhere, have a right to protest peacefully without being brutally attacked by their own government and having the internet shut down for days. The world is watching."
Four more years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of this nation. We cannot stand by and watch that happen.
"I’m running for president to build an inclusive middle class where everyone comes along — regardless of race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability."
"It’s time we remember who we are as Americans: we treat each other with dignity, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor."
Our students and educators cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos.
"We must get Donald Trump out of the White House. Once we do, we can:

- Combat climate change
- Rebuild a more inclusive middle class
- Protect and build on Obamacare
- Ensure our government works for all Americans — not just the powerful"
"The American people are still waiting to see your tax returns, @realDonaldTrump. What are you hiding?"
"Obamacare provided protections to over 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. It was a huge step forward, but we can’t stop there. I’ll protect and build on Obamacare to ensure every American has the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care."
"Many of those seeking asylum on our southern border are fleeing horrific forms of gender-based violence. As president, I will restore asylum status for domestic violence survivors &amp; spearhead an initiative to end violence against women and girls in Central America. #16Days"
Jill and I greatly admire the work of @NobelPrize laureate @DenisMukwege and @PanziHospital for raising awareness and caring for survivors of sexual violence in eastern Congo. We must end impunity for perpetrators. #16Days
"It's time we start rewarding work, not just wealth. As president, I'll reverse Trump's tax cuts for the super-wealthy and build a stronger, more inclusive middle class."
"26 years ago, I fought to get the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act passed — and established the background check system that has kept guns out of the hands of so many dangerous individuals.

I’ve taken on the @NRA and beaten them — twice. As president, I’ll do it again."
"Jill and I would like to extend our greetings to those celebrating the Hmong New Year. Wishing you joyous, colorful celebrations throughout the country filled with music, quality time with family, and all blessings for new beginnings — Nyob Zoo Xyoo Tshiab!"
"Eight years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of our nation. We cannot let that happen.

We must make him a one-term president."
Congressman and former Admiral @JoeSestak has served his country bravely for decades. He ran his campaign with the same standards of strength and respect he has held his entire life. Thank you for your service.
"64 years ago today, Rosa Parks' courageous act forever changed our country and the course of history. We must continue to follow her brave example and speak out against injustice, wherever it is found."
".@GovernorBullock and I have always agreed on a central tenet of his campaign: every American deserves a fair shot. He has served Montana well and will continue to do so with fairness and strength. Thank you, Governor."
@DrBiden @MeghanMcCain Confirmed: true.
"Everyone deserves the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care. My administration will give people the choice between their existing plan and a Medicare-like public option. It’s the most effective way to achieve universal coverage."
Kamala Harris is an incredible talent with unlimited potential. Her career has been defined by taking on those who abuse power and seeking equity and justice for all people. Her intellect and insight will continue to be needed by the Democratic Party and the country.
"Every worker deserves fair wages, good benefits, and protections from sexual harassment. I’m proud to stand in solidarity with @hgsuuaw. I urge the university to negotiate in good faith to secure a fair contract with good health care benefits."
"Congratulations @AFLCIO on 64 years of empowering workers to bargain for what they deserve. The 40-hour workweek, paid leave, health care protections, a voice in your workplace safety — it’s all because of unions. It’s time we recognize that."
"A job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about dignity. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything is going to be okay—and mean it. Too many people today can’t do that.

We have to rebuild an inclusive middle class and restore the dignity of work."
.@DrBiden and I send our prayers to those affected by today's tragic shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola. We're grateful for the brave first responders who rushed to the scene and selflessly risked their lives to save others.
I'm proud to stand with @SEIU1984 and NH’s state employees as they fight for fair wages — Governor Sununu cannot shortchange workers with a contract that doesn't fairly compensate them. #UnionsForAll #NHPolitics
"The Voting Rights Act used to be one of our best tools to fight state laws designed to suppress the vote — particularly the votes of people of color. Then it was gutted by the Supreme Court, and Congressional Republicans have refused a legislative fix."
"Today, House Democrats led the way by passing a bill to restore the Voting Rights Act. All but one Republican voted against it. Shameful. Strengthening our democracy should not be a partisan issue. #HR4 #RestoreTheVote"
"We have a Secretary of Education who doesn't value our public schools, an EPA Administrator who doesn’t believe that climate change is an existential threat, and an Attorney General who puts the selfish interests of the President ahead of the American people. We deserve better."
We cannot stand by and let Donald Trump destroy the character of our nation. We must make him a one-term president.
".@DrBiden and I send our deepest condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues of former Iowa congressman and statesman, Berkley Bedell. Congressman Bedell’s legacy will be remembered as the epitome of public service. Iowa is a better place because he served there."
"No matter where you start in life, there should be no limit to what you can achieve. We’ve got to rebuild the middle class and this time, make sure everyone comes along."
"36,878 — that’s how many Americans have died from gun violence so far this year. We cannot go on like this any longer. We must take action to end our gun violence epidemic."
"It’s been just two months since John Deere laid off 160 workers in the Quad Cities in part because of President Trump’s reckless trade war—and now, a second round of layoffs is expected in the same community.

Trump’s failed policies are destroying American jobs."
"President Trump is leading the most corrupt administration in modern American history. At every turn, he has used the power of the presidency to benefit his own personal interests. It has got to end.

I'll ensure our government works for all Americans — not just the powerful."
@DrBiden Our gun laws make these hate-filled attacks even more deadly. We must pass common-sense reforms to keep guns out of dangerous hands and work to end our gun violence epidemic.
"We must take urgent action to end Donald Trump’s draconian immigration policies. In my first 100 days, we will:

- End his inhumane asylum policies
- End wasteful efforts to build a wall
- Reverse “Muslim bans”
- Reverse his “public charge” rule
- Protect Dreamers &amp; TPS holders"
We are so much better than who Donald Trump thinks we are — we cannot let him define us as a nation.
I’ll rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one—and rally the world to push our progress further and faster. It’s time to put an end to Trump’s shameful abdication of leadership. The future of our country and the world our children and grandchildren inherit hangs in the balance.
"Trump’s reckless decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement has put our ability to confront the climate crisis in jeopardy. It proves he doesn’t have any idea of what we’re up against, despite indisputable evidence. And it again confirms that he's incapable of real leadership."
Donald Trump has presided over the most corrupt administration in modern American history.
"Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he proves how morally unfit he is to lead our country. We must make him a one-term president."
@brianschatz @CarolynBMaloney It is long past time that every American has 12 weeks of paid leave to address their own health needs or care for any of their loved ones.
"President Trump abused his power, violated his oath of office, and betrayed our nation. This is a solemn moment for our country. But in the United States of America, no one is above the law — not even the President."
The defining characteristic of the Trump Administration is the abuse of power.
"I’m about to step on stage for tonight’s #DemDebate in LA. Follow along here and on @TeamJoe for updates throughout the night, and tune in to @PBS and @CNN at 8 PM ET to watch live!"
"My north star as president will be rebuilding the backbone of this country: the middle class. And, I’m going to make sure that this time everyone comes along. #DemDebate"
"If anyone has reason to be angry with the Republicans and not want to cooperate it's me, the way they've attacked me, my son, my family. I have no love. But the fact is we have to be able to get things done and when we can't convince them, we go out and beat them. #DemDebate"
"America's commitment to Israel’s security must be unwavering. The Obama-Biden administration provided unprecedented levels of assistance, including for Iron Dome. But true peace and security for Israelis &amp; Palestinians requires a two-state solution. Trump has set us back."
"The United States and our partners make up more than half of global GDP. If we stand together, China won’t be able to withstand the pressure. We should be mobilizing our allies to meet this challenge, not driving them away. #DemDebate"
I have long been a skeptic on Afghanistan. We must learn the lessons of the past 18 years. It is long past time to end America’s longest war and focus on what is achievable: a narrow counterterrorism mission. #DemDebate
"The ability to make change will come down to three things:
 
- Who can beat Trump?
- Who can help flip the Senate?
- Who can turn big ideas into change?
 
I am the best candidate on stage to do all three. #DemDebate"
"I’m more optimistic about our future today than I was when I got elected to the Senate as a 29-year-old. If we come together and act as one America, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish."
"When Champ and Major go to the vet, I want them to get the best care, and for their caretakers to be paid a fair wage. @marspetcareUS are standing in the way of unionization efforts at @VCAPetHealth and @bluepearlvet. Vet techs deserve a voice in the workplace."
.@DrBiden and I send our warm wishes to everyone celebrating Hanukkah in the United States and around the world. Chag Sameach!
"Jill and I would like to send our best wishes to everyone celebrating Kwanzaa. Today is the start to a seven-day reflection on the rich heritage of African-American culture, remembering the seven principles."
"I want to clarify something I said yesterday. In my 40 years in public life, I have always complied with a lawful order and in my eight years as VP, my office — unlike Donald Trump and Mike Pence — cooperated with legitimate congressional oversight requests."
"But I am just not going to pretend that there is any legal basis for Republican subpoenas for my testimony in the impeachment trial. That is the point I was making yesterday and I reiterate: this impeachment is about Trump’s conduct, not mine."
The subpoenas should go to witnesses with testimony to offer to Trump’s shaking down the Ukraine government — they should go to the White House.
"Our democracy is in trouble. We’re at the breaking point. And we need a president who will rise above the personal attacks and reach out to unite this nation.

If we come together and act as one America, there's nothing we can’t accomplish."
"As we move into the New Year, there's one thing I know: in 2020 we're going to beat Donald Trump and take back this country."
"It was a privilege to work with @JulianCastro during the Obama Administration, and a true honor to be in this talented field of candidates with him. He led his historic campaign with grace and heart and used his platform to lift the voices of others. Thank you, Mr. Secretary."
"If you're a teacher or a firefighter, you're probably paying more in taxes than Amazon or Netflix. We've got to make sure corporations pay their fair share."
"We're just one full day into 2020 and there have already been at least three mass shootings across the country.
 
Enough is enough. We have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to end this gun violence epidemic."
Let's be clear: Donald Trump does not have the authority to take us into war with Iran without Congressional approval. A president should never take this nation to war without the informed consent of the American people.
"On Día de los Reyes, as Christmas comes to a close, we are reminded of the call of the three kings: to give of ourselves without expectation, seek peace no matter how long the journey, and know that a bright future is within reach. Jill and I wish a Happy Three Kings’ Day to all!"
"I’m going to hold off on commenting on the news tonight until we know more, but there is one thing I will say: Jill and I are keeping our troops and Americans overseas in our prayers. We hope you’ll keep them in yours."
"I'm thankful no one was hurt in last night's attack. But we're only in this mess because Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran Deal (which even his advisors said was working), turned his back on our allies, and had no strategy for what comes next."
"Instead of using his statement today to lay out a coherent strategy on Iran, Donald Trump used it to mislead the country on the Obama-Biden record. He's been President for three years. It's time he stops blaming President Obama for his failures."
"Trump’s reckless policies have needlessly endangered our interests in the Middle East. But none of us should be under any illusions about the Iranian regime, and the Iranian people — like all people everywhere — have the right to peaceful protest. The world should support them."
"There’s enormous opportunity once we get rid of Donald Trump. We can:

- Address the climate emergency
- Build a more inclusive middle class
- Build on Obamacare
- Ensure our government works for everyone — not just the powerful"
"Cory, you campaigned with joy and heart, and instead of just talking about bringing people together, you did it every day. You made our politics better just by running. Grateful to you and looking forward to your continued leadership."
"The stakes of this election could not be higher. Eight years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of our nation. We can't let that happen.

We have to do everything in our power to make him a one-term president."
"We’re in a battle for the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. He has:

- Fanned the flames of hatred and bigotry
- Embraced dictators
- Ripped children from their parents' arms
- Degraded our national character

We have to get him out of the White House."
"I’m about to step on stage for tonight’s #DemDebate in Iowa. Make sure to follow along here and on @TeamJoe for updates throughout the night, and tune in to @CNN at 9 PM ET to watch live!"
In 2009 President Obama asked me to oversee our effort to bring home our combat troops. I’ll put my record and my judgment up against anyone in terms of who is the right person to be Commander in Chief. #DemDebate
"When Trump discarded the Iran nuclear deal he promised it would produce a “better” one and curb Iranian aggression—the reverse happened. Iran has restarted its nuclear program and become more provocative. I’ll return to smart, disciplined diplomacy to address the threats we face."
No one should shed a tear for Qassem Soleimani. But Trump’s reckless escalation and thoughtless withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal has made America less safe. We need a return to diplomacy and a steady hand at the wheel to navigate an increasingly dangerous world. #DemDebate
There’s a big difference between sending tens of thousands of American combat troops to the Middle East indefinitely – which I oppose and will end – and using small teams of special forces to support local forces doing the fighting to advance our common security. #DemDebate
No president can take our country to war without the informed consent of the American people. #DemDebate
"I wouldn’t meet with Kim Jong Un without pre-conditions. By meeting with him, Donald Trump gave Kim Jong Un what he was looking for: legitimacy. I will work closely with our allies and hold China accountable for its lack of pressure on the Kim regime’s bad behavior. #DemDebate"
"If we don’t write the global rules of the road for trade, cyber, climate change, and so much more, they may be written by China or other nations that don’t share our values. #DemDebate"
"I’ve been very clear about what my health care plan would do: Build on Obamacare by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system easier to navigate. #DemDebate"
Medicare should be able to negotiate prices with drug companies. #DemDebate
Child care is personal to me: I was a single parent as a young senator. I commuted home to Delaware every night to tuck my kids into bed. Child care should be affordable for every parent. #DemDebate
"Republicans have savaged my only surviving son. They’ve spread lies about me that networks won’t even carry. It doesn’t matter if they go after me.

As President of the United States, I have to be able to not only fight — I have to heal. And that’s what I’ll do if I’m elected."
"Look, I’ve been the object of Donald Trump’s affection now more than anyone else on this stage. I’ve taken all the hits he’s delivered, and I’m only getting stronger in the polls. #DemDebate"
"This is the United States of America. There’s not a single thing beyond our capacity, if we do it together. Let’s go do it. #DemDebate"
"It is a moral failing when children are ripped from their parents' arms, locked away in overcrowded detention centers, and denied toothbrushes and soap.

We have to end Donald Trump's cruel policies and build a fair and humane immigration system."
Weapons of war have no place in our communities. It’s time we take on the @NRA and ban assault weapons for good.
"There used to be a basic bargain in this country—when you worked hard, you shared in the prosperity you helped create. But CEOs and Wall Street continue to put profits over workers. It's wrong.

We have to restore the dignity of work and ensure everyone earns what they deserve."
"The 60th anniversary of our alliance with Japan reminds us that close partnership and deep cooperation are among our greatest assets. I understand the value of our alliances; they make us stronger. I would build on this legacy, rather than dismantling it."
"As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” As we seek to restore the soul of this nation from a long moral lapse, we look to those words and take solace that this too shall pass and justice will prevail. #MLKDay"
"Our government should work for everyone — not just the powerful or super-wealthy. We need to:

- Eliminate all private dollars from federal elections
- End Citizens United and dark money groups
- Increase transparency and accountability"
"We have to end Citizens United, but we can't stop there. It's time we eliminate all private dollars from federal elections and return our democracy to the people."
"47 years ago today, #RoevWade recognized a woman's constitutional right to choose — but that right is under attack across the country. We must codify Roe into law and fight back against any state laws that violate it."
An administration that gives trillions in tax cuts to giant corporations and the super-wealthy but cuts food assistance for the most vulnerable in our society is morally bankrupt.
"When we divert public funds to private schools, we undermine the entire public education system. We've got to prioritize investing in our public schools, so every kid in America gets a fair shot. That's why I oppose vouchers. #Espinoza"
It’s not hyperbole to say Donald Trump is a threat to our planet. We have to get him out of the White House and treat the climate emergency like the existential threat that it is. Our future depends on it.
Let’s be clear: Transgender equality is the civil rights issue of our time. There is no room for compromise when it comes to basic human rights.
"Happy Lunar New Year to all those celebrating throughout the country. I'm grateful for the contributions that the AAPI community has made to enrich America's diversity. I hope the Year of the Rat brings good fortune, health, and happiness to all."
"Make no mistake: Our best days still lie ahead. If we come together and act as one America, there's nothing that we can't accomplish."
Jill and I are sending our prayers to the Bryant family and to everyone who lost loved ones in today’s crash. It’s a reminder of how special — and fragile — life is. And it’s a reminder that we’ve got to make every day count.
"On #HolocaustMemorialDay and the 75th anniversary of Auschwitz's liberation, we honor the millions of Jews and other victims whose lives were extinguished by the Nazi regime. Today and every day, we must give hate no safe harbor to ensure such atrocities never again occur."
Let's be clear: Donald Trump's Muslim ban was never about safety — it was a blatant ploy to fan the flames of bigotry and score points with his political base. I will end it.
Let's remember one thing when it comes to impeachment: Donald Trump is on trial because he's afraid to run against me. He knows I’ll beat him this November.
The decision to allow the Trump Administration to discriminate against immigrants based on wealth is a cruel betrayal of our values. The next four years could have a generational impact on our federal courts — we have to make Donald Trump a one-term president.
Equal pay for equal work is common sense — and long overdue. That's why the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first law that the Obama-Biden Administration signed 11 years ago today. We have to continue the fight until we close the gender pay gap once and for all.
"It’s no understatement to say that Donald Trump represents an existential threat to the future of our country. He has repeatedly shown little understanding of — and zero regard for — our laws, our values, or our democracy.

We have to get him out of the White House."
"Time and time again, Donald Trump has proven he has no moral rudder. Instead of having respect for others, he insults and demeans. He preys on divisions and stokes hate, instead of healing and uniting.

Trump is everything we aspire not to be as Americans."
"We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency."
"When I say we need to restore the soul of the nation, I’m not talking about taking us back to an America that never existed—but propelling us forward to a place we’ve never been. Where we finally live up to our highest ideals and everyone gets a full share of the American dream."
"The next president will inherit a country divided — and a world in disarray. There will be no time for on-the-job training.

We need a president who is ready on day one."
"America's character is on the ballot. I don't believe we're the dark, angry nation we see in Donald Trump's tweets — we are so much better than who he thinks we are."
We need a president who is not only ready to fight but is also ready to heal this country — and that’s exactly what I’ll do as president. There’s nothing we’ve been unable to do when we do it together.
"Everybody knows who Donald Trump is — it’s time we show them who we are. We choose: 

Hope over fear. 
Science over fiction. 
Unity over division.
Compassion over cruelty. 
Truth over lies."
The fight against cancer is personal for me — like it is for so many people. And it's a fight we must win. With the incredible breakthroughs we've made in recent years — and with so many just over the horizon — I'm confident that we will end cancer as we know it. #WorldCancerDay
"Rosa Parks helped ignite a movement that changed the course of history. Let’s carry on her legacy by continuing to push our nation to finally live up to our highest ideals. We can’t rest until we achieve liberty, justice, and equality for all. #RosaParksDay"
"Last night, President Trump turned his constitutional obligation to inform Congress about the state of our union into an episode of reality television. It was a shameful display. #SOTU"
"Mayor Pete likes to call me part of the old failed Washington. Was it a failure when I helped pass Obamacare, the Paris Agreement, the Violence Against Women Act, or the assault weapons ban?

I have a stronger record of passing big, progressive legislation than anyone running."
Looking forward to discussing what’s at stake in this election and my bold vision for the future of our country at tonight’s town hall in New Hampshire. Tune in to @CNN at 8 PM ET to watch live.
"I firmly believe America's best days still lie ahead. If we come together and unite this country, there's not a single thing we can't do."
"John DiEleuterio had a huge heart and was a friend I counted on for over 50 years. As a Colonel in the National Guard and as the State Director in my Senate office, John served our country with dignity and distinction. Jill and I send our condolences to Maureen and his family."
It’s not hyperbole to say that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Everything that makes us who we are is at stake. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and take back this country.
We need a president who chooses compassion over cruelty.
We’re not only going to have to win the White House but we have to bring along the United States Senate. We can’t do that with someone who labels themselves as a Democratic Socialist. #DemDebate
Donald Trump should have been pinning a medal on Lt. Col. Vindman — not Rush Limbaugh. #DemDebate
"Donald Trump called our troops’ traumatic brain injuries “headaches.” 

If my son had still been there in Iraq, I’d have been so damn angry. 

Donald Trump does not deserve to be commander in chief for one more day. #DemDebate"
"As President, I will use military power responsibly and as a last resort. We will not go back to forever wars in the Middle East. #DemDebate"
"The United States must keep our commitments when we make them, otherwise we have no power to lead the world. The only way to not become the police of the world is to have allies that will join us in dealing with failed states and terrorism. #DemDebate"
"Five.

That’s how many times Senator Sanders voted against the Brady background check bill that has kept 3 million firearms out of dangerous hands.

I helped pass it.

We need a president who'll stand up to the @NRA — not stand with them against lifesaving gun safety measures."
Rebuilding the middle class and ensuring that this time everyone comes along starts with one word: unions. That’s why I look forward to signing the #PROAct as President. Congratulations to the House and labor movement for passing this landmark bill.
"It’s not enough to just end Citizens United — we have to eliminate all private dollars from our federal elections.

It's time we return our democracy to the people."
"I've lost a lot in my life, but I'll be damned if I'm going to stand by and lose my country too. We have to beat Donald Trump."
Experience matters. The White House is no place for on-the-job training. We need a president who will be prepared to clean up Donald Trump’s mess on day one.
"President Mandela was no ordinary man. When he stepped out of prison 30 years ago today, he immediately resumed his life's work to end apartheid. He showed us that trust and reconciliation are possible, delivering justice for his people."
"Thank you to all of our incredible supporters, volunteers, and staff in New Hampshire! Your hard work and faith in our campaign mean the world to me. Now, we’re headed to Nevada, South Carolina, and beyond."
99.9% — that’s the percentage of African-American voters who have not yet had a chance to vote in this nomination process. You cannot and should not win the Democratic nomination for President without the support of black and brown voters.
"We need a president who chooses unity over division. If we come together and unite this country, there’s nothing we can’t do."
"I'm looking forward to seeing @MichaelBennet continue the fight to unify our nation, and beat Donald Trump, in the Senate — Coloradans are lucky to have him in their corner."
"Under Donald Trump:

- Job growth has slowed
- Manufacturing is worse off
- Income inequality is higher than ever

He is squandering the growing Obama-Biden economy that he inherited — just like he has squandered everything else that he has inherited in his life."
".@AndrewYang is a leading voice about the challenges of the fourth industrial revolution. He brought fun and new ideas to the race. I'm grateful for it, and hope we hear more from him regarding how to ensure workers succeed in an era of increasing automation."
"Obamacare covered 20 million additional Americans, protects over 100 million people with pre-existing conditions, and allows young people to stay on their parents' plans until age 26.

We shouldn't tear all that down and start over — we should protect and build on it."
"I have said from the day I announced that we’re in a battle for the soul of this nation. That is even more true today. We have a president who has been sending dog whistles of encouragement and support to white supremacists and hate groups.

We have to beat Donald Trump."
"America is full of possibilities. With Donald Trump out of the White House, we can:

- Solve the climate crisis
- Rebuild the middle class
- Make health care a right
- Ensure our government works for all — not just the powerful"
No one needs an AR-15. Period. We have to get these weapons of war out of our communities.
"Donald Trump’s inhumane, fear-based immigration policies are a stain on our nation. We have to get him out of the White House and ensure our laws reflect our values as a nation of immigrants."
We are the United States of America. We are strong and great because of our diversity — not in spite of it. Donald Trump doesn't get that. We need a president who does.
We are so much better than Donald Trump.
"On #PresidentsDay, we remember the leaders who showed strength in moments of fear, who brought us together in moments of division, and showed empathy in moments of pain.

Then we remember that today, our President is Donald Trump. In November, let's end this chapter of history."
"We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Donald Trump: 

- Fans the flames of hate and emboldens white supremacists
- Embraces dictators
- Rips children from their parents' arms
- Spouts racist lies about immigrants

We have to get him out of the White House."
I know that these past few years have felt like a constant crisis. But this moment is more than a crisis — it’s also an extraordinary opportunity. It’s a chance for us to come back together as a nation to reassert the values that define us as Americans.
Lots of people on stage talked about health care tonight. I’m the only one who’s gotten anything done. #DemDebate
"You can sue tobacco companies. 

You can sue pharmaceutical companies.

The only companies you can’t sue are gun manufacturers because of a law Bernie Sanders voted for. #DemDebate"
I’ve been knocked down a whole hell of a lot. But I know how to get back up. We have to get up and provide safety and security for the American people. #DemDebate
"We have to take on the @NRA and pass real reform to end our gun violence epidemic. That starts with universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons, and holding gun manufacturers accountable.

I've beaten the gun lobby twice — and I'll do it again as president."
Last night’s debate took place blocks away from the site of the deadliest mass shooting in American history — where a lone gunman took 58 precious lives and injured hundreds of others. Yet there were zero questions about how we end our gun violence epidemic. It was unacceptable.
"We fall into the same pattern every time: a senseless act of violence occurs, politicians offer “thoughts and prayers,” and calls for reform fade away until the next tragedy inevitably occurs.

I’m sick and tired of saying “enough is enough.” We can’t go on like this any longer."
"I'm about to take the stage for tonight's town hall in Las Vegas, Nevada. Tune in to @CNN at 8 PM ET to watch live."
"America's teachers and school personnel have been forced to make ends meet with too little pay and too few resources to educate our kids. That'll change in my administration.

Thank you @AFTunion and @rweingarten!"
Vladimir Putin doesn’t want me to be President. He doesn’t want me to be our nominee. If you’re wondering why — it’s because I’m the only person in this field who’s ever gone toe-to-toe with him.
Donald Trump and Stephen Miller have raised the standard of cruelty with their inhumane immigration policies. We have to get them out of the White House and ensure our laws reflect our values as a nation of immigrants.
There is nothing that the United States of America can’t do if we do it together.
We need a president who will always choose compassion over cruelty.
Donald Trump is the most corrupt president we’ve ever had — and the American people deserve to know what he’s hiding in his tax returns.
"This election is about more than just beating Donald Trump. It’s about:

- Replacing Betsy DeVos with an actual educator
- Having an Attorney General who defends the Constitution, not the president
- Ensuring our EPA Administrator believes climate change is an existential threat"
The right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is. We should be making voting easier — not harder.
"With Donald Trump out of the way, there’s no limit to what America can achieve."
"Ban assault weapons.

Enact universal background checks.

Hold gun manufacturers accountable.

End our gun violence epidemic."
"Five. That’s how many times Senator Sanders voted AGAINST the Brady background check bill that has kept 3 million firearms out of dangerous hands.

We need to put a black woman on the Supreme Court.
"I taught constitutional law for a long time and here's the deal: No amendment is absolute. There are limits.

Common-sense reforms like background checks and a ban on assault weapons are not a violation of the Second Amendment. Period."
"A $15 an hour minimum wage is long overdue, but it’s just the start. We have to make sure every single worker receives the pay and dignity they deserve."
"With nearly 2 million Dominicans and their families in the U.S., we have so much to celebrate on Dominican Republic Independence Day! The everyday contributions of Dominican Americans to our country has enriched our lives and made us stronger."
I’m running for president to offer our country a different path — not back to a past that never was — but to a future that fulfills our true promise as a nation.
"America was founded on the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all. We’ve never fully lived up to that promise — but we’ve never stopped trying. We can’t rest until we reach our highest ideals and justice truly rings out for all."
"We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Donald Trump’s poisonous rhetoric has emboldened the worst among us to crawl out from under their rocks and spread their hate openly.

We have to get Trump out of the White House and give hate no safe harbor."
"Thank you, South Carolina! To all those who have been knocked down, counted out, and left behind — this is your campaign. Together, we will win this nomination and beat Donald Trump."

- Build on Obamacare — not scrap it
- Take on the @NRA and gun manufacturers — not protect them
- Stand up for the middle class — not raise their taxes and make promises that can’t be kept

Then this is your campaign."
Honored to have @BetoORourke join us on the stage tonight in Dallas. Tune in now to hear what he has to say:
"Whether you supported Pete, Amy, Beto, or any other candidate in this race — know that there is a home for you in our campaign. I will do everything I can to earn your vote."
The last few days have made one thing very clear: We are building the campaign that will beat Donald Trump.
"If you want a Democratic nominee who can:

- Beat Donald Trump
- Keep Nancy Pelosi as Speaker and hold the House
- Take the US Senate and state legislatures

Then this is your campaign."
"Let’s unite.

Let’s beat Donald Trump.

And let’s take back this country!"
".@MikeBloomberg, I can’t thank you enough for your support—and for your tireless work on everything from gun safety reform to climate change. This race is bigger than candidates and bigger than politics. It’s about defeating Donald Trump, and with your help, we’re gonna do it."
"I have said it many times in this campaign. This nation will be able to overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if this man is reelected, we won’t recognize this country in a few years.

We have to get Trump out of the White House."
"We need judges who will respect Roe v. Wade as the law, and we need a Congress that will protect reproductive rights. If I'm president, that leadership will start at the top."
"America was built on the simple idea that we're all created equal—but we've never lived up to it. We've had to fight for it. And we've got to recognize the women who have kept the fires of justice and equality blazing, lighting the way forward for us all. #WomensHistoryMonth"
We are building the coalition that will defeat Donald Trump.
"Senator @EWarren is the fiercest of fighters for middle class families. Her work in Washington, in Massachusetts, and on the campaign trail has made a real difference in people's lives. We needed her voice in this race, and we need her continued work in the Senate."
And to Bailey: Champ and Major would love to have you over any time.
We should not tear down Obamacare. Period. We need to protect and build on it with a new public option to ensure every American has access to the care they need.
We need a president who will choose unity over division.
"Climate change is the existential crisis of our time. On day one, I'll rejoin the Paris Agreement — and then rally the world to push our progress further."
"We are so much better than who Donald Trump thinks we are. This is the United States of America. We treat each other with dignity, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor."
"We're going to rebuild the great American middle class. And this time, we're going to bring everyone along regardless of race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability."
"If we give Donald Trump four more years in the White House, our planet may never recover."
We are in a battle for the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. We have to get him out of the White House.
"Our diversity is, and has always been, our greatest strength as a nation. Donald Trump doesn't get that — we need a president who does."
Jill and I wish a Happy Holi to those celebrating the arrival of spring and the Festival of Colors! May the rest of your year be filled with a rainbow of colors and optimism. #Holi2020
"Once we get Donald Trump out of the White House, we have an enormous opportunity to build the future this nation deserves. A future where every American has access to affordable health care, where we end our gun violence epidemic, and where we tackle the climate crisis head-on."
.@AndrewYang is one of the brightest minds there is when it comes to the challenges we face in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. I'm honored to have his endorsement — and look forward to working with him to ensure every worker can succeed in the changing 21st-century economy.
"After last night, we are one step closer to restoring decency, dignity, and honor to the White House."
"At this moment — when there is so much fear in the country and all across the world — we need American leadership. We need presidential leadership.

Today at 1:00 PM EST, I’ll be addressing the nation on how we should be moving forward to confront the #CoronavirusPandemic."
We need to ensure that every person who needs a coronavirus test can get one — and that the test is free. Period.
"No president can promise to prevent future outbreaks, but I can promise you this: When I'm president, we will be better prepared, respond better, and recover better. We'll lead with science and listen to the experts. And I will always, always tell you the truth."
"A wall will not stop the coronavirus.

Banning all travel from Europe — or any other part of the world — will not stop it.

This disease could impact every nation and any person on the planet — and we need a plan to combat it."
"I believe this nation can overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if he’s given eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation.

We can’t let that happen. We have to defeat Donald Trump."
"The White House is no place for on-the-job training — Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus has made that even more clear. We need a president who is ready to clean up his mess, take responsibility, and lead us forward on day one."
"I know many are anxious about the spread of the coronavirus and the threat it poses. And my thoughts are with all those affected, our first responders and health care providers who are putting themselves on the line for others, and everyone making sacrifices to stop the spread."
"This crisis requires a national response. Not just from our elected leaders, or public health officials—but from all of us. We must follow the guidance of the @CDCgov and health officials and take appropriate precautions to protect ourselves and, critically, to protect others."
"The right to vote is the most sacred American right there is. State election officials are working closely with public health officials to hold safe elections. If you are feeling healthy, not showing symptoms, and not at risk of being exposed to COVID-19: please vote on Tuesday."
"If you're exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 — or might be at risk — absentee or vote by mail options are the best way to make your voice heard, while protecting your neighbors."
"Across the country, middle and working class families are being squeezed by debt. This is a massive problem, and one that we need all of the best ideas to solve. That's why today, I'm adopting two plans from @BernieSanders and @ewarren to achieve this."
"First: Bernie has put forward a plan that would make public colleges and universities free for families whose income is below $125,000. It's a good idea, and after consideration, I am proud to add it to my platform."
"Second: Few people in the country understand how bankruptcy hurts working families more than Elizabeth Warren. Today, I am fully endorsing and adopting her bankruptcy plan, which she called ""Fixing Our Bankruptcy System to Give People a Second Chance."""
"When we have a coronavirus vaccine ready to go, it should be made widely available, free of charge. Period."
"This is a crisis. We’re at war with a virus. 

No one should have to pay for coronavirus health care costs. #DemDebate"
This is bigger than any one of us. This calls for a national rallying to come together. #DemDebate
"People want results, not a revolution. #DemDebate"
"All those people Bernie says he cares about would have been in deep trouble without the bailout in 2008/2009. It was about saving the economy — and I agree with Bernie, some bank executives should have gone to jail. #DemDebate"
People need help now. Not four years from now. Not eight years from now. We need a health care plan that can pass. #DemDebate
"Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady background check bill that has kept 3 million firearms out of dangerous hands, not once, not twice, but five times. 

We need a president who will stand up to the @NRA — not one who stood with them against lifesaving gun safety measures."
"If Senator @BernieSanders is the nominee, I will throw my full weight behind his campaign and do everything I can to get him elected. If I am the nominee, I hope he will do the same. Nothing can keep us from being united in the fight to defeat Trump. #DemDebate"
My running mate will be a woman. #DemDebate
"We have to treat climate change like the existential threat it is. As president, I will:

- End subsidies for fossil fuel corporations
- Ban new drilling on federal lands &amp; waters
- Hold oil executives accountable
- Rally the world to raise the commitments of the Paris Agreement"
Xenophobia is a disease. #DemDebate
"$90 billion in clean energy funding. A huge reduction in the cost of solar so that we'll never build another coal plant again. 



I did that. Bernie watched. #DemDebate"
We need a president who will always choose science over fiction.
"Thank you to our health care providers, first responders, grocery and other retail workers, and so many others that are keeping us safe and prepared. This coronavirus pandemic makes it clear that all workers deserve paid sick live, workplace protections and unemployment benefits."
"We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Donald Trump threatens everything we stand for, he has:

- Fanned the flames of hate
- Embraced white supremacists
- Separated families at the border
- Threatened our democracy

We have to get him out of the White House."
This crisis requires a decisive economic response. We need to do whatever it takes to deliver relief for our families and ensure the stability of our economy.
"This moment demands that we choose:

Hope over fear
Unity over division
Truth over lies
Science over fiction"
I know the American people have the capacity to meet this moment. There’s nothing we’ve been unable to accomplish if we do it together.
It is a national disgrace that millions of Americans do not have a single day of paid sick leave.
"The Obama-Biden Administration set up the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense to prepare for future pandemics like COVID-19.

Donald Trump eliminated it — and now we're paying the price."
"This is a moment to look out for our neighbors, care for the elderly, and thank the workers on the front lines of this fight. This is a moment to believe in one another.

When we do that, when we see the best in each of us, we’ll lift this nation up and get through this together."
.@TulsiGabbard has put her life on the line in service of this country and continues to serve with honor today. I’m grateful to have her support and look forward to working with her to restore honor and decency to the White House.
"Yesterday, President Trump said he was invoking the Defense Production Act, then turned around and said he wasn't planning to use it. The President should exercise these powers now. We need more ventilators, protective equipment, and critical supplies. We need action, not words."
"Doctors and nurses are making their own makeshift face masks today as they risk their lives to care for others. What other finding do you need to see to convince you to use every power you have to expand our supply of essential equipment, Mr. President?"
"I am calling on every CEO in America to publicly commit now to not buying back their company's stock over the course of the next year. As workers face the physical and economic consequences of the coronavirus, our corporate leaders cannot cede responsibility for their employees."
"Every CEO in America should be focusing on workers, families, and communities — not executive compensation and share prices."
"The least we can do for every grocery and retail worker working around the clock during this crisis is to provide a $15 minimum wage, paid sick leave, and strong workplace protections."
The president has been behind the curve throughout this whole response. He’s talking about yesterday rather than where we need to be tomorrow. The president needs to stop talking and start rallying government action with the urgency and ambition this moment demands.
"Now he’s switched to falsely telling us that he’s taking action that he has not taken, and promising results that he’s not delivering. People are scared. They're frightened. And their president is just exacerbating their concerns."
"In times of crisis, the American people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility. Donald Trump has not been that president. For months, he falsely told us we had nothing to worry about while praising China’s response for managing the coronavirus."
"From day one, the goal of our campaign has been to unite the country — and in times of crisis, that goal is more important than ever. If we come together and all do our part, we will overcome this. I promise."
"The coronavirus test should be made widely available and free.

The coronavirus vaccine, when ready, should be made widely available and free.

Treatment for coronavirus should be free, too.

We're in a crisis. No one should have to pay for their coronavirus health care costs."
"We owe a debt of gratitude to the first responders, health care providers, grocery and retail workers, transportation workers, public safety officials, and everyone working around the clock to keep our country running. Thank you, thank you, thank you for all you’re doing."
"No bill should pass without conditions on corporations to ensure the help they get goes to their workers, not their CEOs. No blank checks."
"No bill should pass without immediate, generous relief for workers who are losing jobs and hours, small businesses losing revenue, and communities facing emergency needs."
"On March 6th, Donald Trump claimed: “Anybody that wants a test can get a test.”

That was a flat-out lie then, and it’s still not true today. It’s a disgrace.

We need to ensure everyone who needs a test can get one free of charge. Period."
"We should also increase monthly Social Security checks by $200/month, as proposed by Senator Wyden and colleagues. Seniors and people with disabilities are uniquely at risk right now."
"In this moment of crisis, we should be sending federal resources to those who need it most. It's not just good economics — it's the right thing to do. We have to get this right."
"Additionally, we should forgive a minimum of $10,000/person of federal student loans, as proposed by Senator Warren and colleagues. Young people and other student debt holders bore the brunt of the last crisis. It shouldn't happen again."
"In January, Donald Trump claimed the coronavirus was “totally under control.”

In February, he said it would disappear.

Now, he’s saying it “could’ve been stopped pretty easily if we had known.”

Donald Trump knew. He failed to act. And now we’re paying the price."
"I know we are up to this challenge. The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. We can and will overcome this — together."
The stakes in this election couldn’t be higher. Donald Trump is wholly unfit to lead this nation — and that has become even clearer in the last few weeks. We have to vote him out of the White House.
"Let me be very clear: No one is expendable. No matter your age, race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability.

No life is worth losing to add one more point to the Dow."
The American people are rising to meet this moment. We need our president to do the same.
"It's hard to believe this has to be said, but if I'm elected president, I will always lead the way with science. I will listen to the experts and heed their advice. I will do the opposite of what we’re seeing Donald Trump do every day."
"The relief bill passed by Congress was a good start, but now we need to:

- Forgive at least $10,000 of student loan debt per person
- Provide emergency paid sick leave to everyone who needs it
- Ensure no one has to pay for COVID-19 treatment or an eventual vaccine"
"The coronavirus is not Donald Trump's fault, but his inept response is.

He ignored the warnings for months, downplayed the threat it posed, and failed to take the action needed to combat the outbreak.

It's one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history."
Let me be clear: No one should have to pay for coronavirus testing or treatment.
"As president, I will always choose hope over fear, unity over division, truth over lies, and science over fiction."
We will overcome this — together.
"I am issuing this challenge to the President: in the next 48 hours, direct the production and distribution of respirator masks, gloves, protective face shields and gowns to fill every supply request made by a governor to the federal government. 

Lives are at stake."
"The American people are generous, decent, good, and fair. In times of crisis, we come together as one. We look out for our neighbors and lend a hand to those in need. We will get through this, together. I promise."
"The medical professionals on the front lines of this crisis are American heroes — risking their lives in order to save others. We owe them more than we could ever repay, but we can start by ensuring they have the protective equipment they need to stay safe. #NationalDoctorsDay"
We have to place a temporary ban on evictions nationwide. No one should be forced out of their home in the middle of a pandemic.
I'm confident that the American people will meet this moment. There’s never been a challenge we've been unable to overcome if we do it together.
"Today and every day, @DrBiden and I are proud to stand with the trans community. We see you, we support you, and we will continue to do everything we can to ensure you are affirmed and accepted just as you are. #TransDayOfVisibility"
"Thank you to the governors who are meeting this moment with decisive action, a steady hand, and compassionate leadership. Thank you for stepping up when President Trump has not."
It is a national disgrace that our health care workers still don't have the protective equipment they need.
"It's now April, and:

- States still don't have enough tests
- Hospitals still don't have enough ventilators
- Health care workers still don't have enough masks

Donald Trump needs to use all available authorities immediately to solve these shortages."
"I know many folks are feeling anxious and worried. I just want you to know that you're not alone. Americans in every corner of the country are feeling the same exact way you are. We may be physically apart, but we are all in this together — and we will overcome this. I promise."
"Now more than ever, we need to choose hope over fear. We will beat COVID-19. We will overcome this. Together."
"I’ve done this work before. It’s hard, painstaking work.
 
I was in charge of administering the $800 billion Recovery Act — so I understand that the devil is in the details. It’s about follow-through."
"Those are the kinds of questions Trump will be responsible for. He doesn’t have a great record when it comes to delivering on promises, but I hope this time is different.
 
Being president is about taking responsibility. The blame game won’t cut it. Too many lives are at stake."
"The CARES Act provides money to help working people—how do we make sure it gets to them as quickly as possible?
 
There’s money for major corporations—how do we make sure that there is rigorous oversight to ensure it is used to help workers and not enrich top executives?"
"Donald Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he is responsible for failing to prepare our nation to respond to it."
Every day that Donald Trump refuses to use the full power of the Defense Production Act further threatens American lives.
"On #WorldHealthDay, we thank the tireless health care workers fighting COVID-19, and we see clearly why protecting the health of Americans requires U.S. global leadership—to coordinate an international response, strengthen health systems everywhere, and prevent the next pandemic."
"@blackenterprise Jill and I send our heartfelt condolences to the entire Graves family. As the founder of Black Enterprise, Earl Graves Sr. was a trailblazer in his own right, a leader in the American business community, and paved the way for many Black entrepreneurs to realize their dreams."
"The weeks ahead will be some of the toughest we’ve ever experienced as a nation. We need to face them with the same spirit and resolve that have guided us through previous crises. Because out of every trial and tribulation, America has always emerged stronger — and we will again."
"We know how hard this is. You have put the interest of the nation – and the need to defeat Donald Trump – above all else. And for that we’re grateful. But we want you to know: we’ll be reaching out. You’ll be heard by me. As you say: Not me, Us."
"And to Bernie’s supporters: I know that I need to earn your votes. And I know that might take time. But I want you to know that I see you, I hear you, and I understand the urgency of this moment. I hope you'll join us. You're more than welcome: You're needed."
"To Bernie and Jane, as friends, from Jill and me: You haven’t just run a political campaign; you’ve created a movement. And make no mistake about it, we believe it’s a movement that is as powerful today as it was yesterday. That’s a good thing for our nation and our future."
This nation has never been defeated when we’re together. And we’re not going to be defeated now.
"If we come together, we will defeat Donald Trump. And when we do that, we will not only do the hard work of rebuilding this nation — we will transform it."
Let me be clear: No one should have to pay for their coronavirus treatment.
The stakes in this election have never been higher. We have to come together and beat Donald Trump.
"Whether you supported Bernie or any other candidate throughout the primary, know that there is a home for you in our campaign. You're not just welcome — you're needed. And I will do everything I can to earn your vote this November."
"The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. There's nothing we can't do if we do it together."
"Now more than ever, we have to choose hope over fear, unity over division, truth over lies, and science over fiction."
"This new enemy may be unseen, but we have the tools, the expertise, the will, and the spirit to defeat it. There is nothing the American people can't accomplish if we work together."
We are in the middle of a global pandemic — and people need access to health care now more than ever. Donald Trump should reopen Obamacare enrollment immediately.
"To everyone on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19, thank you. We truly couldn't get through this without you."
"Leadership is about never proclaiming power. It’s about collaboration, it’s about coming together in a crisis and finding common ground. It’s about results.  

That’s who I am and the role I aspire to fulfill in guiding this democratic nation to better times."
"We won’t defeat this President by being like him. We’ll win by doing the opposite. Where he seeks to divide us, we’ll connect people. Where he shows cruelty, we’ll show compassion. And when he fights, we’ll fight harder. But we can’t do it without you."
"In the Biden family, we have a code: My mom used to always tell me, “Joey, no one is better than you. Everyone is your equal, and everyone is equal to you.” I’m working on building one for our campaign, too."
"Mayor @PeteButtigieg’s campaign had a set of “rules of the road” that helped define the character of his campaign and his supporters. I think it’s a good idea, and one I’d like @TeamJoe to adopt."
"When we emerge from this crisis, we can't just go back to the way things were. We need to build a better future for all."
We’re in the middle of a global pandemic. No one feeling ill should have to choose between earning a paycheck or staying home to recover. We need to provide paid sick leave to everyone who needs it immediately.
I know the American people will beat this. We’re brave and big-hearted. We’ve emerged stronger from every crisis that has tested us as a nation — and we will again.
Donald Trump says he’s a wartime president — it’s time for him to act like one.
"No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I can promise you that when I'm President, we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better. We'll listen to the experts and heed their advice. And I will always tell you the truth."
"We have to come together to make Donald Trump a one-term president. Once we do that, we will not only do the hard work of rebuilding this nation — we will transform it and create a better future for all."
"In times of crisis, Americans stand as one. We lend a hand to our neighbors and take care of those in need. It's who we are. In that spirit, and to celebrate the one-year anniversary of our campaign, we're hosting S.O.U.L. of the Nation Saturday this weekend."
The President needs to stop blaming others and do his job.
"Out of every trial and tribulation, America has always emerged stronger — and we will again. We will not be defeated."
"This Holocaust Remembrance Day, as we remember the millions of Jews who lost their lives at the hands of the Nazi regime, we recommit to ensuring such atrocities never again occur. With anti-Semitism on the rise, all of us must root out intolerance and give hate no safe harbor."
"The Trump Administration promised 27 million tests by the end of March.

As of now, only 4 million have been completed. It’s unacceptable.

We can’t safely reopen the economy without scaling up testing, and we can’t effectively scale up testing unless Donald Trump does his job."
"The climate emergency requires our urgent action. As president, I will:

- Ensure we achieve a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050
- Rejoin the #ParisAgreement and rally the world to go further
- Make the largest-ever investment in clean energy"
@OfficialJLD Stranger things have happened.
"This #EarthDay, let’s recommit to doing everything in our power to combat climate change. That starts with voting Donald Trump out of the White House this November."
Our planet cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump.
"Make no mistake: The climate crisis poses an existential threat to our future. But I know the American people have the spirit, power, and ingenuity to meet the challenge head-on. There’s nothing we’ve been unable to accomplish when we do it together."
"I can’t believe I have to say this, but please don’t drink bleach."
It’s stories like these that make me so proud to be an American and make me confident that we will overcome this. Because there’s nothing the American people have been unable to accomplish when we do it together.
"After seeing the shortage of masks around the country, Marilyn decided to step up and organize efforts in Northern Virginia to make homemade masks. Because of her selfless work, countless front line workers have the masks they need to stay safe."
"Across the country, people are stepping up and doing incredible things amid this pandemic. It’s who we are as Americans—in times of crisis, we stand as one. For #SOULSaturday, I called a few folks to thank them for all they’re doing. Here are some of their stories:"
"Brien usually works at the Ford Plant in Rawsonville, Michigan, driving a semi. But when the plant started assembling much-needed ventilators, he courageously stepped up and volunteered to help. His selfless actions will no doubt save countless lives."
"John, a Facilities Maintainer from Staten Island, recently contracted and survived the coronavirus. Shortly after he recovered, a colleague contracted the virus and needed plasma to battle it. John heroically stepped up and donated his plasma to help his coworker."
"Older adults are especially vulnerable to COVID-19. Recognizing that, Erica decided to organize youth in her community to buy groceries for seniors — ensuring they receive the food they need while staying safe at home. She's a true hero."
"One year ago, we launched this campaign. Whether you were on #TeamJoe from day one or have joined in recent weeks — I’m incredibly grateful for your support and hope I make you proud. Together, we’re going to beat Donald Trump, unite this country, and transform our nation."
"@AmandaLinton23 @templehospital Amanda, this is remarkable. Thank you for stepping up and supporting our front line heroes. I know the staff will greatly appreciate your donations."
"@a_zinsner8 @TeamJoe This is great, Addie. Tell your mom and sister I say thank you for lending a helping hand to your neighbors."
"@Im4fit Julie, I can’t thank you enough for all you’re doing to ensure folks have food and supplies during this crisis."
"@Emmieinthecity Michelle, this is a great idea. Thank you for doing what you can to ensure folks have the masks they need to stay safe."
@carobrissett @pizzahut I bet this made their day. Thank you for stepping up and doing what you can to help those on the front lines of this fight.
"Imagine the future we can build with Donald Trump out of the White House. A future where:

- Health care is a right
- We combat climate change
- We end our gun violence epidemic
- Our government works for all — not just the powerful

Let’s build that future, together."
The American people are stepping up and rising to meet this moment. It's time for our president to do the same.
America has always met every big challenge with an even bigger solution — this moment should be no different. We need an infrastructure program that will combat climate change and create good-paying jobs at the same time.
"Let me be very clear: No one is expendable.

We shouldn’t allow rationing of health care that discriminates based on age or disability."
"There are nearly 330 million people in the United States — and according to the Trump White House, we've only conducted 5.4 million COVID-19 tests. It's abysmal.

Donald Trump needs to scale up testing, and he needs to do it immediately."
"Throughout our history, we have emerged from every crisis stronger than before — and we will again."
"Wear a mask in public.
Read your daily briefings.
Listen to the experts.

This really isn't rocket science. It's common sense."
"With rent due in a few days and folks across the country worried they won't be able to make their payments, it's clear more needs to be done to provide relief. We need to freeze rent immediately for people who have lost their jobs and place a temporary ban on evictions."
"- More than 60,000 people in the U.S. have died
- 30 million have filed for unemployment
- At least 1 million have gotten sick

Enough with the late night Twitter tantrums, Mr. President. It's time for you to step up and lead."
"When we emerge from this crisis, we can't just go back to the way things were before. We have to build a better future for all.

We can and will transform this nation — together."
"As we mark the beginning of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, @DrBiden and I extend our best wishes to AANHPI communities across America. We look forward to celebrating your extraordinary accomplishments and contributions in the month ahead."
"When we come together and act as one America, there's not a single thing we cannot accomplish."
"On March 6th, Donald Trump said: “Anybody that wants a test can get a test.”

It was a lie then, and it's still not true nearly two months later. It's a disgrace, and it's slowing efforts to reopen safely.

This administration needs to act immediately to surge testing nationwide."
"My heart and Jill's are with the people of Puerto Rico in the wake of another damaging earthquake. As the island grapples with both the impact of this earthquake and this pandemic, we need to ensure they get the resources and assistance needed to recover as soon as possible."
Mi corazón y el de Jill están con Puerto Rico a raíz de los terremotos de hoy. Mientras la isla enfrenta el impacto de este suceso y la pandemia del COVID-19 tenemos que asegurarnos que reciban los recursos y la asistencia que necesitan para recuperarse lo más pronto posible.
This pandemic is bigger than any one individual or country. This moment requires all of us to come together — across the nation and around the world — to solve this crisis.
A free press is essential to a free society. That's why attacking the press and attempting to intimidate independent media is a standard part of the authoritarian playbook around the world. And it’s why Donald Trump’s efforts to demonize the media put us on such a dangerous path.
"Trump deflects legitimate questions with attacks. He bullies members of the press, instead of taking responsibility for his failures. His efforts to undermine public confidence in the integrity of reporting violate our core values and threaten our very system of government."
"The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. We can and will overcome this — together."
I've always believed that we've been at our best when we've acted as one America. This crisis is an opportunity for us to be that nation again. There's not a single thing we cannot accomplish if we do it together.
"Make no mistake: We can emerge from this crisis a stronger, better, and fairer nation. It’s within our power — we just need a president and an administration who are up for the task."
"Let me be clear: Essential workers on the front lines of this crisis deserve premium pay, emergency paid sick leave, and protections that keep them safe."
"Thank you to all the:

Firefighters
Paramedics
Police officers
Doctors
Nurses
Medical support staff
Grocery and retail workers
Meatpackers
Delivery drivers
Transit workers
And everyone else on the front lines of this fight.

You truly are the heart and soul of this country."
"The stakes in this election have never been higher. Over the last few months, we've seen how wholly unfit Donald Trump is to lead our nation.

We have to vote him out of the White House this November."
"The nurses on the front lines of this crisis are American heroes. We owe them more than we could ever repay, but we can start by ensuring they have the protective equipment they need to stay safe, emergency paid sick leave, and premium pay. #NationalNursesDay"
"I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: No one is expendable. No life is worth losing to add one more point to the Dow."
"I can't hit the campaign trail in-person due to COVID-19 — so instead, I’m traveling across the country from my home in Delaware. Head over to my Instagram to catch up on today’s trip to Florida 📲."
"Here's the simple truth: The United States of America has never been defeated when we're together — and we're not going to be defeated now.

We can and will overcome this."
"Donald Trump loves to crow about what a great economy he built.

This crisis has revealed what a failure Trumponomics has been. And American workers and families are paying the price. 

Tune in for my remarks live on @nowthisnews at 12 PM EDT."
"75 years ago on #VEDay, America and its allies defeated fascism in Europe. From the devastation of war, we built a lasting peace. Today, as we honor the veterans who sacrificed for us, let us remember the importance of uniting against common threats."
"We need to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class. And this time, we're going to bring everyone along.

We have to make sure every single person gets a fair shot at success."
There’s no quit in America. None at all. We’re going to get through this — and we're going to come out stronger.
"Ordinary people, given half a chance, have never let their country down.

That’s who I believe in. That’s who I’m in this race to fight for."
Don't let anyone tell you differently: We have the power to write the future we want for our country.
Donald Trump and his team seem to understand how critical testing is to their own safety. So why are they insisting that it’s unnecessary for the American people?
I believe everyone deserves a fair shot at success — not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd.
"Here's the deal: We can choose who our country works for. We can choose whether it works for just the wealthy — or everyone else as well.

That’s the choice we must make — all of us together — this November."
"There's nothing that the American people cannot accomplish when we stand together — one nation, united in purpose."
We are months into this crisis. There is simply no excuse for President Trump's failure to implement a national testing strategy.
"To all of our front line workers who are working day in and day out to keep our nation afloat during this crisis, thank you."
"We have the power to create the future we want. A future where:

- We end our gun violence epidemic
- We lead the world in combating climate change
- Everyone has access to the health care they need
- Our government works for all — not just the wealthy and well-connected"
"Trump's international failures have cleared a path for Cuba to join the UN Human Rights Council. This would betray Cuba's political prisoners and further undermine U.S. diplomacy. As President, I will lead by empowering the Cuban people and defending human rights."
"Los fracasos internacionales de Trump han abierto el camino para que Cuba se una al Consejo de Derechos Humanos de la ONU. Esto traiciona a los presos políticos en Cuba y mina aún más la diplomacia de los EE.UU. Como presidente, defenderé los derechos humanos del pueblo cubano."
Science over fiction.
"From this moment of crisis, we have the opportunity to not just rebuild our economy — but transform it."
"Behind every COVID-19 death is a family and a community that will never be the same.

Behind every unemployment claim is a life thrown into uncertainty — a person wondering how they’ll make ends meet.

There is a real human toll to this crisis. We cannot forget that."
"As we reflect on the incredible legacy of Brown v. Board of Education, we’re reminded of the urgent work that remains before us 66 years later. We can’t rest until every kid gets a fair shot, and we finally live up to our founding ideals of liberty, justice, and equality for all."
"A year ago today, the House passed the #EqualityAct, a long-overdue bill that would ensure LGBTQ+ people are treated with dignity and respect under the law. But @SenateMajLdr won't bring it up for a vote. It's unacceptable.

Passing it will be a top legislative priority of mine."
"In times of crisis, Americans stand as one. It's who we are. And it's how we're going to get through this — together."
Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history — and his recovery efforts are making that clearer than ever.
"- Expand vote-by-mail and early voting
- Implement online voter registration
- Ensure everyone can safely vote in-person

We need to do everything in our power to ensure every American can safely make their voice heard this November."
Donald Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus. But he does bear full responsibility for failing to protect our nation from the worst public health and economic crisis in our lifetime.
"It’s time we reward the people who actually make this country work. Not Wall Street CEOs — but the middle class. Ordinary women and men who are capable of doing extraordinary things when given half a chance.

That's who I'll fight for every single day in the White House."
We need a president who believes in science.
"During today’s Senate Banking Committee hearing, Secretary @StevenMnuchin1 refused to require corporations benefiting from $500 billion in CARES Act funds to keep workers on their payrolls. @EWarren asked him several times, each time he ducked and refused."
"That's exactly why @EWarren and I have called for more oversight. We need more conditions on corporations to ensure relief goes to their workers, not their CEOs. No $500 billion slush fund. No blank checks. The Trump Administration is prioritizing big corporations over workers."
The United States of America has always emerged stronger from every trial and tribulation — and we will again. We will overcome this.
"When we emerge from this crisis, we can’t just go back to the way things were before. We need to take this country to a place we’ve never been. Where we finally live up to our highest ideals and everyone gets a full share of the American dream."
"Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose to unite rather than divide."
Donald Trump needs to do his job and implement a national testing strategy.
"When I launched my campaign, I said we were in a battle for the soul of the nation — we’re seeing that soul on full display. Folks are reaching out to help one another and doing truly heroic things. It makes me so proud."
"In the middle of this crisis, President Trump is trying to cut food assistance. It’s morally bankrupt.

We should do everything in our power to ensure no one goes hungry in America."
"The hard truth is Donald Trump ignored the warnings of health experts and intelligence agencies, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and failed to take the action needed to combat the outbreak.

It’s one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history."
We can protect the sacred right to vote and protect public health at the same time.
"As Ramadan draws to an end, @DrBiden and I want to wish a safe and warm celebration to our Muslim friends and neighbors. Even though we can't be all together to celebrate, we hope it is filled with joy, family, and success for the year to come. #EidMubarak"
Make no mistake: I believe our best days still lie ahead. We can and will transform this nation — together.
Climate change poses an existential threat to our future — and time is running out to address it. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and tackle the challenge head-on.
The presidency is about a lot more than tweeting from your golf cart. It requires taking on the ultimate responsibility for the biggest decisions in the world. Donald Trump simply wasn’t prepared for that. I promise you I will be.
"We have always been able to take crises and turn them into opportunities — and we have the chance to do that once again. If we match our ambitions to the scale of the challenges we face, we can and will transform our country for generations to come."
There’s not a single thing the American people can’t do if we do it together.
So much of this could have been prevented if we had a president who listened to someone other than himself.
1 in 4 U.S. workers has filed for unemployment benefits in the last 10 weeks. It’s a crisis unlike anything we’ve seen in our lifetime — and the Trump Administration is failing to do enough to help.
"Donald Trump's wealthy donors got tens of millions of dollars in relief, while countless small businesses were turned away. It's no wonder he didn't want any oversight.

We need a government that works for all — not just the super-wealthy."
Wear a mask.
"Last year California passed #AB5, affording gig workers protections and benefits like a minimum wage and overtime pay.

Now, gig economy giants are trying to gut the law and exempt their workers. It's unacceptable.

I urge Californians to vote no on the initiative this November."
"We’re in the middle of a global pandemic — and not only is Donald Trump preventing people from getting the health insurance they need, but he’s also actively trying to terminate the insurance millions already have.

It’s morally reprehensible."
The hard truth is that this crisis didn’t have to be this bad.
"100,000+ lives lost across the country.
1,700,000+ confirmed U.S. cases.
40,000,000+ unemployment claims filed.

Donald Trump has failed our nation."
Enough.
"This is not abstract: a black reporter was arrested while doing his job this morning, while the white police officer who killed George Floyd remains free. I am glad swift action was taken, but this, to me, says everything."
"I will not lift the President’s tweet. I will not give him that amplification. But he is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many. I’m furious, and you should be too."
I will be speaking more about the events in Minnesota later today.
"It’s time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.

It’s time for us to face the deep, open wound we have in this nation.

We need justice for George Floyd."
"This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence.

This is a national crisis — and we need real leadership right now."
"If we are complacent, if we are silent, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence.

None of us can turn away. We all have an obligation to speak out."
"In this moment, the very soul of America is at stake.
 
We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being.
 
We have to finally make real the American promise: That all men and women are not only equal at creation, but throughout their lives."
"A country is crying out for leadership. Leadership that can unite us, leadership that brings us together, leadership that can recognize the pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time."
"The President held up a bible at St. John’s church yesterday. If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something: 

That we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves. 

That’s hard work. But it’s the work of America."
"I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation.

Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important—who we want to be. It’s all at stake.
 
That is truer today than ever. And it’s in this urgency we can find the path forward."
"When 100,000 Americans died because of his incompetent leadership, this president golfed.

When Americans peacefully protested outside the White House, this president tear-gassed them for a photo-op.

Donald Trump was elected to serve us all — but he only looks out for himself."
"If the Senate has time to confirm Donald Trump’s unqualified judicial nominees, it has time to pass legislation that will give true meaning to our Constitution’s promise of equal protection under the law.

No more excuses. No more delays."
"I ask all of America — not to deny our pain or cover it over — but to use it to compel our nation across this turbulent threshold into the next phase of progress, inclusion, and opportunity for our great democracy."
"If we stand together, we will rise stronger than before. A more equal, more just, more hopeful nation — closer to that more perfect union we must always strive to be."
The nation is crying out for leadership — but this president has nothing to offer.
"We are at our best when we open our hearts, not when we clench our fists."
"It's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike this president, I’ll do my job and take responsibility. I won’t blame others. And I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me — it’s about you."
We can’t take four more years of this.
"We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us.
 
We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us.
 
We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us."
It is long past time we made the promise of this nation real for all of our people.
Let’s be clear about something: The depth of this job crisis is not attributable to an act of God — but to the failure of a President.
"This #GunViolenceAwarenessDay, I am reflecting on the life of Hadiya Pendleton, whose murder inspired the #WearOrange movement.

The hard truth is that Black Americans are ten times more likely to die by gun homicide. It has to stop."
150 days.
"Today, we honor those who answered duty’s call on June 6, 1944, on the beachheads of Normandy. We must be a living memorial to their bravery and sacrifice—and recognize always that our strength is rooted in our fervid and unfailing defense of democratic rights and freedoms. #DDay"
"I promised George Floyd's family that he wouldn’t just become another hashtag — and I intend to keep that promise.
 
We need justice. And we need real police reform to ensure this never occurs again."
"We need to stand up as a nation — with the Black community and with all minority communities — and come together as one America. Because the pain is too immense for one community to bear alone.
 
It is the duty of every American to grapple with it — and grapple with it now."
"The words of a president matter. And time and time again, Donald Trump has callously used his to incite violence, stoke the flames of hatred and division, and drive us further apart.
 
We cannot give him another four years in the White House."
Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this moment.
"American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending. But we have the power to write the future we want for this nation.

Don't let anyone tell you differently."
"We're facing some of the greatest challenges in our history, and Donald Trump is patting himself on the back. He just has no idea what’s really going on in this country.
 
It's time for him to step out of his bunker and look around at the consequences of his words and actions."
"My Dad used to say there's no greater sin than the abuse of power.

Whether it's an officer bloodying a peaceful protester or a President defending him with a conspiracy theory he saw on TV.

I'm a Catholic – just like Martin. Our faith says that we can't accept either."
"Let me be clear: We can't leave this moment and once again turn away and do nothing.
 
We need justice. We need action. We need reform."
"Because of Donald Trump's negligence and incompetence:
 
- More than 110,000 people have died
- We have nearly 2 million cases of COVID-19
- Over 20 million Americans are out of work
 
And yet he’s patting himself on the back. Unbelievable."
"America was founded on the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all. We’ve never fully lived up to that promise — and we can’t rest until we finally do."
"Nothing about the fights we're facing will be easy. Racism has been a fixture in our society for hundreds of years. 
 
But I’m ready to get to work on day one. We can’t accept anything less from an American president."
It's in our darkest moments that we've produced some of our greatest progress — and we have that opportunity once again. Let's make this a moment of action to address systemic racism and propel our nation into an era of true equality and opportunity.
"Folks, we saw in 2016 what can happen when social media platforms are left unchecked and allow disinformation to run rampant. It puts the very integrity of our elections at risk.
 
We simply cannot let it happen again in 2020."
We need a president who chooses hope over fear.
"Donald Trump forgot about COVID-19, but COVID-19 didn’t forget about us. 

The President couldn’t wish away the virus in April, he couldn’t tweet it away in May, and he can’t ignore it away in June."
"We need real policing reform, and we need it now. Congress should immediately:

- Outlaw chokeholds
- Improve oversight and accountability
- Create a model use of force standard
- Stop the transfer of weapons of war to local police forces"
"Medgar Evers once said, ""freedom has never been free."" On this day in 1963, he paid the ultimate price in pursuit of freedom for his brothers and sisters. He was gunned down fighting to end racial injustice. We must honor him by carrying forward that cause in our own lives today."
"I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. That is truer today than ever. If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will fundamentally alter the character of this nation.
 
We can’t let that happen."
We need a national ban on chokeholds. Now.
"Our nation is at an inflection point. We can't go back to the way things were before — we have to take a bold step forward and usher in a new era of equality and opportunity.

We can do it, together."
We need a president who will fight to further LGBTQ+ equality — not roll back the hard-won progress we've already made.
"We’re facing some of the greatest challenges in our nation’s history — and it’s clear Donald Trump isn’t up for the job.

We need real leadership, right now."
"We need a president who heals — not one who fans the flames of hate.
 
We need a president who unites — not one who sows further discord for political gain.
 
We need a president who leads the way with a steady hand — not one who incites violence with his erratic tweets."
"In every corner of the country, people are raising their voices and demanding justice. It gives me so much hope.

Together, we’re going to transform this nation and ensure justice finally rings out for all."
LGBTQ+ rights are human rights. Period.
"This virus won’t just go away because you want it to, Mr. President. It’s time for you to step up and do your job."
"We can’t forget that in the middle of a global pandemic, the Trump Administration is trying to gut Obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. It's morally reprehensible."
"We have the power to write the future we want for this country. One where health care is a right, we lead the world in the fight against climate change, we end our gun violence epidemic, and our government works for all — not just the powerful.

Let’s do it together."
We need a president who chooses unity over division.
"The truth of our nation is that too often the color of your skin alone can endanger your life and, for far too long, systemic racism has oppressed communities of color in the United States.

It has to change."
"If John Bolton's accounts are true, it’s not only morally repugnant, it’s a violation of Donald Trump’s sacred duty to the American people to protect America’s interests and defend our values."
"Donald Trump wants to style himself a wartime president against an invisible enemy — but he has surrendered the fight.

Instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he has waved the white flag and retreated."
"Here’s my promise to you: On day one, I’ll send a bill to Congress that creates a clear roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and 11 million undocumented people who are already strengthening our nation. It’s long overdue."
Dreamers are Americans. Period.
"The decisions of the last few days should remind us all of the immense power of the Supreme Court — and the generational impact its justices can have.

We have the power to shape the Court's future this November — and we can’t forget that."
"#Juneteenth reminds us of how vulnerable our nation is to being poisoned by systems and acts of inhumanity—but it's also a reminder of our ability to change. Together, we can lay the roots of real and lasting justice, and become the extraordinary nation that was promised to all."
Donald Trump’s failure to fight the coronavirus with the same energy and focus that he uses to troll his enemies on Twitter has cost us lives — and is putting hope for an economic recovery at risk.
"I know it can be hard to keep faith that we will ever achieve that more perfect union we strive to be. But ours is a union worth fighting for — and we are all called to the cause.

None of us can turn away. None of us can stay silent."
"We're months into this pandemic and still don't have proper testing, PPE, or clear nationwide guidance. Instead, Donald Trump:

- Pushes dangerous, disproven drugs
- Stands in the way of the CDC
- Refuses to wear a mask

He is failing even the most basic test of leadership."
"Donald Trump is so eager to get back to his campaign rallies that he’s willing to put people at risk and violate CDC guidelines — as long as they sign a waiver promising not to hold his campaign liable.

Unbelievable."
Speed up the testing.
"We can overcome four years of Donald Trump. But if we give him eight years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.

We can't stand by and let that happen."
"It's worth repeating that this weekend, President Trump admitted he directed his administration to slow down coronavirus testing in the middle of a global pandemic.

He continues to prove just how unfit he is to lead our nation."
"The American people are tough, resilient, and always full of hope. There’s not a single thing we can't do if we do it together."
"We need a president who will expand access to quality, affordable health care — not rip it away."
"Workers called back on the job deserve access to regular, reliable COVID-19 testing."
Health care is a right for all — not a privilege for the few.
Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through a global pandemic.
"Last week, President Trump claimed the virus would ""fade away.""

Now, we're facing a record-high number of new cases, and it's surging across the country.

Trump refuses to listen to the experts and take action — and we're all paying the price."
"I know these times are dark, but I firmly believe that our best days still lie ahead. If we come together as one America, there's nothing that we can't accomplish."
"Every day that Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office, he proves just how unfit he is to lead our nation."
"Today the President shared a video of people shouting “white power” and said they were “great.” Just like he did after Charlottesville. 

We’re in a battle for the soul of the nation — and the President has picked a side. But make no mistake: it’s a battle we will win."
White supremacy should be rooted out and relegated to the pages of history — not promoted by the President of the United States.
"It's time we remember who we are as Americans: we treat each other with dignity and respect, we leave nobody behind, and we give hate no safe harbor.

We are everything that Donald Trump is not."
"As simple as it sounds, we need a president who listens. So much of this could have been prevented if Donald Trump listened to someone other than himself."
"I want every single American to know: if you’re sick, if you’re struggling, if you’re worried about how you’re going to get through the day — I will not abandon you. I will not leave you to face these challenges alone.

We are going to get through this — together."
"Mr. President, the American people didn’t make enormous sacrifices over the past four months so you could waste your time with late night rants and tweets.

Step up. Take responsibility. Do your job."
"If I’m elected, I’ll immediately reach out to Dr. Fauci and ask him to continue his incredible service to our country. 

I’ll have the nation’s top medical experts and scientists ready to advise our response on day one — and I'll actually listen to them."
"On the final day of #PrideMonth, here’s my promise to you: If I have the honor of being elected, I will be the most pro-equality president in our nation’s history. LGBTQ+ rights are human rights — and we can't rest until everyone is treated with dignity and respect under the law."
"As #ImmigrantHeritageMonth comes to a close, I want to make one thing clear: Immigrants have always made our nation stronger — our diversity is, and has always been, our greatest strength.

Donald Trump doesn't get that — we need a president who does."
"We need a clear message from the very top of our federal government that everyone needs to wear a mask in public. Period.

It’s not just about you — it’s about your family, your neighbors, your colleagues. It’s about keeping other people safe."
I’ll read my daily briefings.
"Donald Trump has called himself a ""cheerleader"" for the nation. But we don't need a cheerleader — we need a President. One who will:

- Lead by example
- Take responsibility
- Tell the unvarnished truth
- Listen to the experts and follow the science"
"We are five months into this crisis, and our health care workers still don't have the masks and protective equipment they need. It's a national disgrace.

Mr. President, use your authority and fix the shortage of PPE before you tee off for yet another round of golf."
"Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose science over fiction."
"This Fourth of July, one of the most patriotic things you can do is wear a mask."
American history isn’t a fairytale. The battle for the soul of this nation has been a constant push-and-pull for more than 240 years. But it’s a battle we can and will win — together.
"America was founded on the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all — and it's long past time we lived up to it."
"Make no mistake, our best days still lie ahead. If we come together as one America, there’s not a single thing we cannot do."
"Donald Trump wants to declare this health crisis over and unemployment solved so that he can get back to his campaign rallies. But he’s wrong — on both fronts.

We need a president who will actually do the work needed to get us through these crises."
"COVID-19 is surging across the nation, and this president is doubling down on his efforts to rip health insurance and protections away from millions. It's heartless and cruel and must be stopped."
"On this Venezuelan Independence Day, my thoughts are with Venezuelans who continue to work tirelessly for the cause of democracy. It’s time for free and fair elections so that the Venezuelan people can turn the page on the corrupt and repressive Maduro regime."
"We're going to beat Donald Trump. And when we do, we won't just rebuild this nation — we'll transform it."
"With COVID-19 surging across the nation, Donald Trump should be doing everything in his power to increase access to testing. Instead, he's doing the opposite. It's despicable."
"There’s enormous opportunity once we defeat Donald Trump. We are going to build our health care system, our economy, and our country back better than they've ever been before."
Donald Trump needs to do his job.
"Trump launched his 2016 campaign by calling Mexicans rapists.

He's spread racism against our Latino community ever since.

We need to work in partnership with Mexico.

We need to restore dignity and humanity to our immigration system.

That's what I'll do as President."
Four years of Betsy DeVos is more than enough. We need a Secretary of Education who is actually a public school educator.
"I do not buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past.
 
American manufacturing was the Arsenal of Democracy in World War II, and must be part of the engine of American prosperity now."
We can't just build back to the way things were before these crises — we have to build back better.
The American people deserve to know what Donald Trump is hiding in his tax returns.
"Through every trial and tribulation, we've always emerged stronger — and we will again."
"Determination. Resilience. Grit. The strength to get up no matter how many times you’ve been knocked down. Respect for hard work, and for the people who do it.
 
Those are the values I learned growing up in Scranton — and they're the values I’ll take to the Oval Office."
"I see a different America than President Trump. One that, despite all our flaws and shortcomings and failings, is still after more than two centuries dedicated to equality, liberty, human dignity, and justice.

I know we can reach our highest ideals — together."
"The United States has over 3 million cases of COVID-19, and over 130,000 people have died — yet Donald Trump continues to say it will just ""fade away."" It’s unbelievable.

We're paying the price for this president's incompetence every single day."
"We need a president who will always choose to unite rather than divide, because there’s nothing we can’t accomplish when we do it together."
"The stakes couldn't be higher this November. Time and time again, Donald Trump has failed the people of Puerto Rico.

As President, I'll spur economic development on the island and expand access to health care."
Donald Trump needs to spend less time playing golf and more time listening to experts like Dr. Fauci.
We shouldn't have to beg this president to listen to the experts.
"Every few weeks when he needs a distraction from the latest charge of corruption in his staff — or the conviction of high ranking members of his administration — Donald Trump announces it’s “Infrastructure Week.”

He's never delivered. I know how to get it done."
"Climate change is the challenge that's going to define our American future. And if I have the honor of being elected President, we won't tinker around the edges, we’ll seize this opportunity and meet this moment in history."
"Mr. President, “Open everything now,” isn’t a strategy for success. It’s barely a slogan. 

It’s long past time for you to step up and do your job."
"President Trump needs to do everything in his power to surge nationwide testing — including developing and evaluating more accurate, affordable, accessible, faster tests so we can reopen safely.

Infection rates are rising at an alarming pace. Mr. President, act now."
"We are months into this crisis, and our health care workers are still being forced to reuse masks. It’s unacceptable.

Mr. President, fix the PPE shortages before you tee off for yet another round of golf."
President Obama and I left a playbook for President Trump on how to fight pandemics. He flat-out ignored it. And we're all paying the price every day.
We have the power to write the future we want for our country. Don't let anyone tell you differently.
"I’ve released 21 years of my tax returns — why hasn’t Donald Trump?

We deserve to know what this president is hiding."
"Eleven. That's how many times we've broken the single-day record for new COVID-19 cases in the last month.

This virus isn't going to ""just disappear"" like President Trump wants. It's surging — and we need real leadership from this White House to slow its spread."
"We are made in the image of God, and then there is John Lewis. He was truly one-of-a-kind, a moral compass who always knew where to point us and which direction to march. To John’s family, friends, staff, and constituents, Jill and I send you our love and prayers."
"Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose hope over fear."
"In this moment of crisis, we have the chance to build a new American economy. One where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead.

Together, we'll get it done."
"Imagine the future we can create with Donald Trump out of the White House. A future where we:

- Tackle the climate crisis
- Build a new American economy
- End our gun violence epidemic
- Ensure our government works for all, not just the wealthy few"
"Every day it becomes clearer: We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Who we are. What we believe. Who we want to be. It’s all at stake.

We have to vote Donald Trump out this November."
"In honor of John Lewis, C.T. Vivian, and all the essential workers who have selflessly risked their lives, the Senate should pass a bill that ensures working people get real relief — extended unemployment insurance, rental support, and guaranteed sick leave. #StrikeForBlackLives"
"Donald Trump simply doesn’t understand: We can’t deal with our economic crisis without solving the public health crisis.
 
And for all his bluster about his expertise on the economy, he is unable to explain how he will actually help the working families hit the hardest."
"We need to make high-quality child care affordable and accessible. As president, I'll give every 3- and 4-year-old access to free, high-quality preschool. And low- to middle-income families won’t spend more than 7% of their income on quality care for children under age 5."
"Home health workers do God’s work, but aren’t paid much. They have few benefits, and 40% are still on SNAP or Medicaid. It's unacceptable.

I'll give caregivers and early childhood educators a much-needed raise."
"For your family, for your neighbors, for your country — wear a mask."
"10 years ago the Obama-Biden Administration signed Wall Street reform to prevent the abuse that led to the Great Recession. Donald Trump and the Republicans have tried to tear it down ever since. As president, I'll protect it so we can rebuild an economy that works for everyone."
"Today, the House passed the #NoBanAct because no one should be discriminated against or singled out based on the faith they practice. I will end President Trump's Muslim Ban on day one and sign this bill into law."
"COVID-19 infections are going up.

The number of deaths is going up. 

This morning it was announced that, once again, the number of unemployment claims is going up. 

Donald Trump is moving us backwards. The American people are paying the price."
We need a president who listens to someone other than himself.
"This is the United States of America. We don’t settle — we aspire.

Let’s get to work."
"I know times are tough, but I want you to know you're not alone. We're all in this fight together. And together, we'll emerge stronger than before."
"President Trump ordered his administration to slow down coronavirus testing, he tried to block CDC funding, and he has ignored the experts from day one. His actions defy both logic and humanity.
 
What kind of president actively undercuts efforts that will save lives?"
There is no quit in America — and you deserve a president who won’t quit on you.
No one should have to work more than one job to make ends meet. We have to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and build an inclusive middle class that brings everyone along.
"As Hurricane Hanna makes landfall, Jill and I are sending our prayers to the people of South Texas. We must ensure that affected residents get the support they need — and get it quickly. If you are in an impacted region, please heed the advice of local officials and seek shelter."
100 days.
"Tonight, Jill and I are thinking about the 150,000 families left emptier by this virus.

To anyone who’s struggling, sick, or wondering how they’ll get through the day: know that I will not abandon you. 

We’ll fight through this crisis together, and emerge stronger than ever."
"The Senate and this President should pass the bill to restore the Voting Rights Act — renamed yesterday in memory of John Lewis.

If they don’t, it will be one of the first things I do as president."
"A change of “tone” over a few days does not change the facts of the last four years.

Donald Trump fails the basic threshold test of being president: the duty to care about the entire country, not just his re-election prospects."
"This election is not just about voting against Donald Trump. It’s about rising to this moment of crisis, understanding people’s struggle, and building a future worthy of their courage and ambition to overcome."
"To support more Black and Brown small businesses, my administration will launch a new Small Business Opportunity Initiative. We're going to make sure that those with the best ideas are not denied the venture capital or financing they need because of their race or zip code."
"My housing plan will give a $15,000 tax credit to first-time home-buyers, expand affordable housing, and reverse President Trump’s efforts to gut fair housing enforcement.

We're going to remove the barriers to homeownership that hold back too many Americans of color."
Donald Trump voted by mail. You should be able to as well.
"I have no illusions about how tough the road ahead is. But I’m optimistic for one reason above all others: I know the history and the heart of this country.

There is nothing we're unable to achieve when we do it together."
"We need an effective, coordinated nationwide testing and tracing program. We need more PPE for health care workers. We need a comprehensive plan to get this virus under control.

We need this president to do his job."
It’s time Senate Republicans back their effusive praise of John Lewis with action. Pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act.
You won't have to worry about my tweets when I'm president.
.@DrBiden and I wish all our Muslim friends and neighbors a blessed #EidAlAdha. May your sacrifices on this day be accepted and strengthen you during these challenging times. Eid Mubarak!
"It’s been over six months since the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States, and President Trump still doesn't have an effective plan to contain its spread. It's an unjustifiable failure of leadership that costs lives every day."
"We’re facing some of the biggest challenges in our history — and it’s abundantly clear Donald Trump just isn’t up for the job.

We need real leadership — and we need it now."
"If we give Donald Trump four more years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of this nation.

We can’t let that happen."
"Enhanced unemployment benefits expired for millions overnight.

We don’t have an effective nationwide testing program or a plan to control the virus.

Our health care workers still don’t have enough PPE.

Enough with the weekend golf trips, Mr. President. Do your job."
"Now more than ever, we need a president who believes in science."
It’s not enough to just go back to the way things were before these crises — we need to build back better than ever. We have to create a new American economy where everyone gets a fair return for their work and an equal chance to get ahead.
"This is a moment to summon the purpose we felt one year ago after El Paso. A moment to recommit to the battle for the soul of this nation. A battle against white supremacy, hatred, and gun violence.

It won't be easy — but it's a battle we must win."
Jill and I mourn the loss of the nine service members who perished in a training accident off the coast of California. These brave young men made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their fellow Americans. Our deepest condolences go out to their families.
"Every American should be able to safely make their voice heard this November. We need to:

- Expand vote-by-mail and early voting
- Implement online voter registration
- Make it safe and easy to vote in-person"
"On July 1st, Donald Trump predicted the coronavirus was going to ""just disappear.""

He was wrong — and more than 25,000 Americans died due to the virus last month.

Mr. President, step up and do your job before even more American families feel the pain of losing a loved one."
"One year ago, just hours after the massacre in El Paso, nine precious lives were cut short in Dayton. In the wake of the tragedies, Donald Trump promised the most modest of gun safety policies, then caved to the @NRA and failed to deliver."
"As president, I’ll take on the powerful gun lobby to pass universal background checks, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and close loopholes to keep guns out of dangerous hands. We can and will end our gun violence epidemic."
"Our hearts and prayers are with the people of Lebanon, and the victims of the horrific explosion in Beirut. I urge both the Trump Administration and international community to immediately mobilize assistance to the thousands injured in the blast."
"From day one, Donald Trump downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, ignored scientists, and refused to take action. 

Now, nearly 5 million cases and more than 150,000 deaths later, it's crystal clear we're paying the price for his failed leadership."
"Eight years ago, a white supremacist targeted a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, WI — ultimately taking seven lives in an unspeakable act of terror. To truly honor those we lost, it's up to all of us to stand up to bigotry in our lives, give hate no safe harbor, and reduce gun violence."
"Folks, a lot of you have been asking when I’m announcing my running mate, and I promise I’ll let you know soon. But here’s what I can tell you right now: I’m going to tell my supporters first — so text FIRST to 30330 to be the first to know."
"55 years ago today, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law — bringing us one step closer to that more perfect union. As we mark its anniversary, we’ve got to continue our fight to restore the VRA and protect the sacred right to vote."
Let me be clear: Voting is a right — not a privilege. Anyone who tells you otherwise can’t be trusted to hold the highest office in this land.
"I believe that the right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is. To protect it, we’ve got to:

- Pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act
- Enact automatic and same-day voter registration
- Stand up to Republican voter suppression efforts"
"Earlier today, I made some comments about diversity in the African American and Latino communities that I want to clarify. In no way did I mean to suggest the African American community is a monolith—not by identity, not on issues, not at all."
"Throughout my career I've witnessed the diversity of thought, background, and sentiment within the African American community. It's this diversity that makes our workplaces, communities, and country a better place."
"My commitment to you is this: I will always listen, I will never stop fighting for the African American community and I will never stop fighting for a more equitable future."
President Trump called Arizona “a model for applying a science-based approach to the decreasing cases and hospitalizations without implementing a punishing lockdown.” He said Governor Ducey’s approach should be used by other states—but here’s what’s really happening in Arizona:
"Gov. Ducey is rushing reopening without adequate testing and contact tracing.

He’s withholding support for increased testing and making local leaders plead for it.

He’s refusing to implement a mask mandate and turning his back on older Americans and those at greater risk."
"Here’s how COVID-19 affected Arizonans under the Trump—Ducey model:

- An infection rate—still—of nearly 20%
- The fifth-highest number of current hospitalizations in the country
- More than 4,000 deaths from COVID-19
- More than 183,000 cases
- Lengthy delays in test results"
"I believe every American deserves a fair shot at success — not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd. That’s why as president, I’ll reverse Donald Trump’s giant tax giveaways to the super-wealthy and big corporations, and build an economy that works for everyone."
"I can’t believe I have to say this, but we can’t let Donald Trump open up the Grand Canyon for uranium mining."
"No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I'll promise you this: when I'm President we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better."
"Our nation is desperate for leadership — leadership that can unite us and steer us through these crises. But at the most critical moment of his presidency, Donald Trump has nothing to offer."
"Between the coronavirus and the economic crisis, this is a tough time for our country, I know. But I firmly believe that our best days still lie ahead. Together, we will climb out of these crises and emerge stronger than before."
"It’s an important choice, and I want you to be one of the first to know who I’ve picked as my running mate – text FIRST to 30330 to get notified when I’ve made my decision."
"The United States just passed 5 million reported infections of COVID-19. It’s a number that boggles the mind and breaks the heart. Each time the number goes up, it represents a life altered, a family stricken with anxiety, a community on edge. It shouldn’t have gotten this bad."
Our planet can’t take four more years of Donald Trump. We have to get him out of the White House so we can start treating the climate crisis like the urgent threat it is.
It's been six years since Michael Brown's life was taken in Ferguson — reigniting a movement. We must continue the work of tackling systemic racism and reforming policing.
We can’t let Donald Trump destroy the U.S. Postal Service.
Every single eligible American should have the opportunity to vote-by-mail this November. If it's good enough for Donald Trump — then it's good enough for you and me.
"To the millions of Americans struggling to get by right now — those who can't find a job or pay the bills: I want you to know that I see you, and I won't forget you — and I'm going to fight every day in the White House to build an economy that works for you."
"Donald Trump said that if he’s re-elected, he’ll defund Social Security.

We can't let that happen."
Social Security is the bedrock of American retirement — giving countless Americans peace of mind and the ability to retire with dignity. I've been fighting to protect and expand the program throughout my career — and I'll continue that fight as president.
"I promise you if I'm elected, I won't waste any time getting this virus under control.

I'll call Dr. Fauci and ask him to stay on. I'll bring together top experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.

We'll get it done, together."
"I have the great honor to announce that I’ve picked @KamalaHarris — a fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country’s finest public servants — as my running mate."
"Back when Kamala was Attorney General, she worked closely with Beau. I watched as they took on the big banks, lifted up working people, and protected women and kids from abuse. I was proud then, and I'm proud now to have her as my partner in this campaign."
"Right now, America faces: 
 
- The worst pandemic in 100 years
- The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression
- The most powerful calls for racial justice in a generation
 
I need someone alongside me who's smart, tough, and ready to lead. @KamalaHarris is that person."
"If @KamalaHarris and I are elected, we’re going to inherit multiple crises, a nation divided, and a world in disarray. We won’t have a minute to waste.
 
That's exactly why I picked her: She's ready to lead on day one."
"As the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, @KamalaHarris grew up believing in the promise of America because she saw it firsthand.

Together, Kamala and I are going to fight every single day in the White House to make sure that promise is fulfilled for all Americans."
"Whether it's taking on the big banks or pushing for marriage equality—Kamala never shies away from fighting tooth and nail for what's right. It's why I chose her to be my running mate.

She'll wake up every day thinking about how to make life better for the people of our country."
"We’ve all watched @KamalaHarris in the Senate go toe-to-toe with Trump officials trying to hide the truth, asking the tough questions that need to be asked — and not stopping until she gets an answer. She’s ready to do this job."
"This morning, little girls woke up across this nation — especially Black and Brown girls who so often may feel overlooked and undervalued in our society — potentially seeing themselves in a new way: As the stuff of Presidents and Vice Presidents."
"Working families need someone on their side...because they certainly don’t have anyone on their side with this president.
 
That’s going to change in the Biden-Harris administration."
"If you’re worried about whether you’ll have a job, worried about the poisons in the air you breathe and water you drink, worried about your civil rights or even your basic dignity being under attack—@KamalaHarris has had your back. Now, we have to have hers."
One of the reasons I chose @KamalaHarris is because we both believe you can define America in one simple word — possibilities.
"Heather Heyer was a brave young woman who saw what was happening in her hometown of Charlottesville and decided to fight against it. 

Let us honor her memory by continuing to stand against hate."
"Three years ago today, white supremacists descended on Charlottesville with torches in hand and hate in their hearts. Our president said they were ""very fine people.""
 
It was clear then, and it's clear now: We are in a battle for the soul of our nation, and we must win."
"We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. And if we're going to get through these crises — we need to come together and unite for a better America.

@KamalaHarris gets that — and I believe there's no better person to help me get the job done."
"I first met @KamalaHarris through my son Beau. They grew close while fighting to take on the big banks — and he had enormous respect for her and her work.

There is no one’s opinion I valued more than Beau’s, and I’m proud to have Kamala standing with me on this campaign."
"Today marks 85 years since the Social Security Act was signed into law, providing protection for the most vulnerable. Now we’re living in a moment where we must strengthen our commitment to Social Security — not defund it."
"Voting by mail is safe and secure. And don't take my word for it:
Take it from the President, who just requested his mail-in ballot for the Florida primary on Tuesday."
"People are losing their homes. Millions have already lost their paychecks. Our country is in crisis.

The virus isn’t taking a break — Republicans shouldn’t either. The House did their job. President Trump, bring the Senate back and pass a relief bill. Now."
"I know just how important Social Security is for countless Americans. That's why as president, I'll protect and strengthen it — not defund it."
I know a thing or two about being Vice President — and I know @KamalaHarris is the best partner I could have for the fight ahead.
"Mr. President, Jill and I are sad to learn of your younger brother Robert’s passing. I know the tremendous pain of losing a loved one — and I know how important family is in moments like these. I hope you know that our prayers are with you all."
We need nationwide mask mandates.
".@KamalaHarris is smart, tough, and experienced. She knows how to govern and make the hard calls.

She's ready to hit the ground running on day one."
"Here’s my promise to you: If I’m elected president, I will always choose to unite rather than divide. 

I’ll take responsibility instead of blaming others. 

I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me — it’s about you."
"As Attorney General of the largest state in the country, @KamalaHarris took on the big banks over mortgage fraud, and Big Oil when they wanted to pollute without consequences.

She's the kind of fighter I need alongside me in the White House."
"The hard truth is that our economy wasn't working for folks long before this crisis. It's why we can't just go back to the way things were — we have to build back better. 

We've got to create an economy that works for everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected."
Just imagine where we would be right now if we had a president who listened to the scientists.
"Thank you @Gwen4Congress and the people of Milwaukee for hosting this year's Democratic National Convention. I wish we could be there to celebrate in person, but I look forward to virtually coming together with folks across the country to make history. #DemConvention"
"Our nation was founded on a simple idea: All men—and women—are created equal.

We’ve never fully lived up to it, but we won’t stop trying.

As we mark the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, let’s make sure we don’t wait another 100 years to fulfill that founding promise."
Be a patriot. Protect your fellow citizens. Wear a mask.
It is the honor of my life to accept the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States of America. #DemConvention
"Jill loves fiercely, cares deeply, and nothing stops her when she sets her mind to making something right. For all of you across the country, just think of your favorite educator who gave you the confidence to believe in yourself. That’s the kind of First Lady Jill will be."
The brave citizens of Belarus are showing their voices will not be silenced by terror or torture. The U.S. should support Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya's call for fair elections. Russia must be told not to interfere—this is not about geopolitics but the right to choose one's leaders.
"Let’s make history tonight, @KamalaHarris."
"Hillary: tonight, I’m reminded of one of your favorite sayings — rooted in the faith we both share: “Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, for as long as you can.”

Thanks for always living by that, and reminding us to do the same."
"Kamala Harris will be an incredible Vice President.

Now let’s get to work. We don’t have a minute to waste."
"Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19 — but he does bear full responsibility for the failed national response. 

We've got to hold him accountable this November."
"I first ran for Senate when I was 29 years old, and I’m as optimistic about our future now as I was then. 

It’s time to set our nation on a new path. One where we finally live up to our highest ideals and everyone has a fair shot to get ahead."
"As our Muslim friends and neighbors mark the start of the Islamic New Year and honor the sacrifice made during the holy month of #Muharram, let us all recommit to standing together in the struggle for compassion, equality, and justice."
It is with great honor and humility that I accept this nomination for President of the United States of America.
"Who we are as a nation, what we stand for, and who we want to be — that's on the ballot this November."
"Our president has failed in his most basic duty to this nation. 

He failed to protect us.
He failed to protect America.
And that is unforgivable."
"I have always believed you can define America in one word: Possibilities. 
 
In America, everyone should be given the opportunity to go as far as their dreams and God-given ability will take them."
"To everyone celebrating the Hindu festival of Ganesh Chaturthi in the U.S., India, and around the world, may you overcome all obstacles, be blessed with wisdom, and find a path toward new beginnings."
"Love is more powerful than hate. 

Hope is more powerful than fear. 

Light is more powerful than darkness.  

This is our moment. This is our mission."
"I give you my word: If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us, not the worst. I will be an ally of the light, not of the darkness."
"America is at an inflection point. 

We can choose the path of becoming angrier, less hopeful, and more divided.

Or we can choose a different path, and together, take this chance to heal, to be reborn, to unite. A path of hope and light."
"As president, the first step I will take will be to get control of the virus that's ruined so many lives.
 
Because I understand something this president doesn't. 
 
We will never get our economy back on track until we deal with this virus."
President Obama and I established a White House office to prepare our nation for future pandemics. Donald Trump eliminated it — and we've been paying the price every single day.
"I promise you that as president, I will protect America. I will protect you and your family. I will defend our nation from threats seen and unseen.

It's the least of what we should expect from an American president."
"As we celebrate #WomensEqualityDay and the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, we have got to renew our efforts to protect the sacred right to vote.

Every eligible American should be able to make their voice heard at the ballot box. Period."
"180,000 people have died from this COVID crisis. And the heartbreaking truth is that it didn't have to happen this way."
"When Donald Trump says tonight you won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America, look around and ask yourself: How safe do you feel in Donald Trump’s America?"
"- 180,000 lives lost
- Nearly 6 million confirmed cases of COVID-19
- Over 25 million Americans out of work
- Countless small businesses on the brink of closing

That's Donald Trump's America. We're living it every day. We can't take four more years."
"Donald Trump calls himself a wartime president. But now, instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he’s waved the white flag.

He abandoned the American people when we needed him most."
"From the moment COVID-19 emerged, President Trump downplayed the threat it posed, refused to listen to the experts, and failed to take action to contain its spread.

Now, we’re paying the price."
Remember: every example of violence Donald Trump decries has happened on his watch. Under his leadership. During his presidency.
"We can't let George Floyd and Jacob Blake become just another pair of hashtags.

This is a moment of action.

It's long past time we reform policing, reverse systemic racism, and make our communities safer."
"As we mark the 57th anniversary of the March on Washington and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech, we must continue the hard work of perfecting our union. It's up to all of us to carry on the march toward equality, liberty, and justice for all."
"America was built on a simple idea: All men — and women — are created equal. 

It’s time we ensured all people are treated equally as well."
"The true power of @ChadwickBoseman was bigger than anything we saw on screen. From the Black Panther to Jackie Robinson, he inspired generations and showed them they can be anything they want — even super heroes. Jill and I are praying for his loved ones at this difficult time."
We have a president more interested in beating people at golf than beating COVID-19.
I believe there's not a single thing the American people can't accomplish if we do it together. We're going to overcome these crises and emerge stronger than before.
"We must not become a country at war with ourselves.

A country that accepts the killing of fellow Americans who do not agree with you. A country that vows vengeance toward one another.

But that is the America that President Trump wants us to be, the America he believes we are."
"Donald Trump has been president for almost four years.

The temperature in the country is higher, tensions run stronger, divisions run deeper.

And all of us are less safe because he can’t do the job of the American president."
"There’s a lot happening, but I hope we don’t overlook the brave fire fighters &amp; emergency responders in the wake of Hurricane Laura.

When the storm hit, they stayed behind—even while their homes were being destroyed—to help their community recover.

True American heroes."
"We are facing so many crises under Donald Trump:
 
COVID.
Economic devastation.
Unwarranted police violence.
Emboldened white nationalists.
A reckoning on race.
Declining faith in a bright American future.

The common thread? A president who makes things worse — not better."
Does anyone believe there will be less violence in America if Donald Trump is reelected?
"Donald Trump may believe mouthing the words law and order makes him strong, but his failure to call on his own supporters to stop acting as an armed militia in this country shows you how weak he is."
"I want a safe America — safe from COVID, safe from crime and looting, safe from racially motivated violence, safe from bad cops. 

And let’s be crystal clear: Safe from four more years of Donald Trump."
"The simple truth is Donald Trump failed to protect America. So now, he’s trying to scare America."
"Trump and Pence are running on this: “You won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.”

And what’s their proof?

The violence you’re seeing in Donald Trump’s America."
"Donald Trump keeps telling us if he was president, you'd feel safe.

Well, he is president — whether he knows it or not."
"More cops have died from COVID this year than have been killed on patrol.

Nearly one in six small businesses in this country are closed.

Do you really feel safer under Trump?"
"Tonight, President Trump declined to rebuke violence.

He wouldn’t even repudiate one of his supporters who is charged with murder.

He is too weak, too scared of the hatred he has stirred to put an end to it."
"Across the country, people rely on public transportation to get to work, see loved ones, and access essential services. But that's all under threat because Republicans refuse to do their jobs.

Congress must act now to save public transit."
.@DrBiden and I send our best wishes to members of the Jain faith concluding the holy observance of Paryushan and Das Lakshan. May we all find peace and reconciliation in our lives. Michhami Dukkaddam and Kshamavani!
"Last month we raised $364.5 million — 95% of the donations from grassroots supporters like you and the majority online.

Working people are powering our campaign — and I’m grateful.

We’ve got a long way to go to close the fundraising gap and win — but we can do it. Together."
Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos are the worst possible people to lead our nation’s schools through this pandemic.
"I've always believed we're at our best when we act as one America. It's time for us to come together, propel our nation across this turbulent threshold, and build a better future for all."
"Right now, classrooms should be humming with excitement for a new year and students’ hopes for their futures.

Instead, many are silent and empty because President Trump didn’t do his job.

America’s families are paying the price for his failures."
"Now is not the time for a victory lap, Mr. President. Just because your wealthy friends and donors are doing well doesn't mean everyone else is.

Get off the golf course. Call the leaders of Congress to the White House. And make a deal that delivers for working people."
"I'm grateful for everyone who found work in August and found that glimmer of hope — but there is real cause for concern in this morning's jobs report.

The pace of job gains in August was slower than in July. And significantly slower than May or June."
"The fact is we're more than six months into this pandemic, and:

- 11.5 million Americans don't have their jobs back
- Almost 30 million are on unemployment
- We're down 720,000 manufacturing jobs
- Nearly 1 in 6 small businesses have closed their doors"
"As president, I will:

- Call for nationwide mask mandates
- Implement widespread testing
- Accelerate the development of treatments and vaccines

I’m ready to work on day one to contain the spread of this virus and get our country back on track."
It’s time we reward work — not just wealth.
"Donald Trump promised to be ""the greatest jobs president God ever created.""

But in reality, he's on track to become the first president in modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than when he entered.

American workers can't take four more years of his failed leadership."
We need to restore honor and decency to the White House.
"The 40-hour workweek
Minimum wage
Overtime pay
Health care 
Workplace safety protections

They’re all because of unions — and it’s time we recognize that."
"For years, President Trump and Republicans have waged a war on America's labor unions. 

It will end on my watch.

I'll sign the PRO Act — making it easier for workers to organize and collectively bargain — and be the strongest labor president workers have ever had."
"It's not enough to just thank our essential workers — we need to pay them. As president, I’ll:

- Raise the minimum wage to $15
- End the tipped minimum wage
- End the sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities
- Ensure everyone has strong benefits"
"Wall Street didn't build this country — the middle class did. And unions built the middle class.

Donald Trump doesn't understand that. We need a president who does."
"At our best, America has always been generous, kind, and optimistic. We treat each other with dignity, give hate no safe harbor, and leave no one behind.

I believe we can be that nation once again."
"This economy may be working great for Donald Trump and his wealthy friends — but it's not working for the rest of America.

It's time we change that."
Donald Trump is incapable of providing the leadership this moment requires.
"3: What is the plan to allocate and distribute vaccines to Americans cost-free, safely, equitably, and without politics?
 
President Trump should release a detailed distribution plan to ensure every American — not just the wealthy and well-connected — receives the vaccine."
"2: Who will validate that the Administration’s decision to greenlight a COVID-19 vaccine is driven by science and not political motivation?
 
We must hear uncensored statements on efficacy and safety from @FDACBER, the @US_FDA vaccine advisory committee, and Dr. Fauci."
"A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine could save countless lives. We need one as soon as possible.

But while I see a vaccine as a product of science, President Trump sees it as a political tool.

Politics should play no role in this. The Administration must answer the following:"
"1: What criteria will be used to ensure a vaccine meets the scientific standard of safety and efficacy?

The FDA must clarify what criteria it will use, and President Trump must commit to respecting the independent judgment of the non-political professional staff at the FDA."
"I promise you that if I’m elected, I’ll always tell you the truth.

I’ll listen to the experts and do everything I can to contain this virus.

And I’ll always put your health and safety first — no matter the political cost."
"If Donald Trump had acted just two weeks earlier, 54,000 lives could have been spared in March and April alone. 

Instead, he downplayed the threat and refused to take action — costing lives and sending our economy into a tailspin.

It’s an unjustifiable dereliction of duty."
You deserve a president who tells you the truth.
Donald Trump said he didn't want to tell the truth and create a panic. So he did nothing and created a disaster.
Donald Trump said he wanted to be a cheerleader for the country. We didn't need a cheerleader. We needed a president.
"This year, we mark the anniversary of 9/11 in the midst of another crisis that compels us to summon the best of the American people in the face of unconscionable, inconceivable loss — a crisis that has already taken nearly 200,000 Americans."
"Now, as then, our heroes are ordinary people doing extraordinary things: nurses and doctors; delivery drivers and grocery clerks; public transit workers and educators; regular Americans thrust into courageous acts of sacrifice and service."
"And now, as then, we owe it to them to come together as a nation — so that Americans can once again do what we did so bravely nineteen years ago: turn from tragedy to purpose, rebuild our lives, and begin, in time, to heal."
"You deserve a President and Vice President who will spend every minute of every day working to make your life better.

I promise that’s exactly what @KamalaHarris and I will do."
"26 years ago today, the Senate passed 10-year bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines—it was an effort I was proud to champion.

These bans saved lives, and Congress should have never let them expire.

As president, I’ll take on the @NRA and we’ll ban them once again."
"With each reauthorization, VAWA has become stronger.

The latest bill—passed by the House last year—would close loopholes allowing abusers to obtain guns and extend protections for Native women.

But Mitch McConnell refuses to bring it to the floor for a vote. It’s despicable."
"Weapons of war have no place in our communities.

We need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines."
50 days.
".@realDonaldTrump, you know what’s actually threatening our suburbs?

Wildfires. Floods. Hurricanes.

We need to act on climate. Now."
"This morning, parents all across the West — already worried about their kids being indoors because of COVID-19 — are now also waking up worried about their kids being outside.

We need a president who takes climate change seriously."
"The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing is a powerful reminder of our past and what remains at stake in this election. As we honor the memory of those four little girls, we must commit to defeating the poisonous ideology of white supremacy that lit the fuse 57 years ago."
"As we celebrate the Independence Day of Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, we must affirm the democratic aspirations and human rights of people across Latin America.

I'll always fight for democracy and for those who come to America seeking a better life."
"Donald Trump not only suggested we sell or trade Puerto Rico — but he also left our fellow Americans without the resources they desperately needed after Hurricane Maria. It's unacceptable.

As president, I'll support the island's full recovery and invest in its people and future."
"We’ve lost nearly 200,000 Americans to COVID-19. 

It didn’t have to be this bad — but Donald Trump failed to do his job."
We’re going to get this virus under control and get your life back on track.
"We've had to endure President Trump's incompetence and dishonesty when it comes to testing, wearing masks, and socially distancing. 
 
We can't afford a repeat of those fiascos with a COVID-19 vaccine.

The stakes are too high."
"If you make under $400,000, you will not pay a penny more in taxes when I'm president.

The super-wealthy and big corporations will finally pay their fair share — and we'll invest that money in working families.

We're going to reward work — not wealth."
"The 100 richest Americans have made more than $300 billion during the COVID-19 crisis.
 
Now, in the middle of a pandemic and economic crisis, Donald Trump wants to give them a $29 billion tax break.
 
Let that sink in."
"Donald Trump wants to give his rich friends another tax cut, so they pay a lower tax rate than tens of millions of essential workers and middle class Americans.

We need a president who cares about more than the wealthy and well-connected."
This election is Scranton vs. Park Avenue.
"When we needed Donald Trump to tell the truth about COVID-19, he lied to us.

When we needed him to take action to contain its spread, he spent his days golfing.

When we needed a president the most, he was nowhere to be found.

It's unforgivable."
"Jill and I wish our friends in the Jewish community a very healthy and happy New Year. As we mark this new beginning, let us commit to pursuing peace and justice in the year ahead. #RoshHashanah"
"Ruth Bader Ginsburg stood for all of us. She was an American hero, a giant of legal doctrine, and a relentless voice in the pursuit of that highest American ideal: Equal Justice Under Law. May her memory be a blessing to all people who cherish our Constitution and its promise."
"Let me be clear: The voters should pick a President, and that President should select a successor to Justice Ginsburg."
We must win.
"When the virus came, President Trump wasn’t thinking about you, he was thinking about his own reelection.

It’s how Trump looks at the world: It’s always about him, never about us.

You deserve a president who will put you first."
"Donald Trump ran for office saying he would represent the forgotten men and women of this country — and as soon as he got in office, he forgot about us."
"Today, we'll pass another grim milestone in this pandemic: 200,000 American lives lost.

Jill and I are keeping everyone who's hurting in our prayers. No words can numb your pain, but know the nation grieves with you.

Today is dark, but we will overcome this. Keep the faith."
"200,000 Americans have died from this virus.

It’s a staggering number that’s hard to wrap your head around. But behind every COVID-19 death is a family and community that will never again be the same.

There’s a devastating human toll to this pandemic — and we can’t forget that."
"Donald Trump sees the world from Park Avenue.

I see the world from where I grew up: Scranton, Pennsylvania."
"Even amidst the profound grief &amp; anger today's decision generated, violence is never &amp; can never be the answer. Those who engage in it must be held accountable. Jill &amp; I are keeping the officers shot tonight in Louisville in our prayers. We wish them both a swift &amp; full recovery."
"On this Feast Day of Our Lady of Mercy, I stand in solidarity with all defenders of human rights from Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela — and pray for the freedom of all political prisoners."
"En el Día de la Virgen de las Mercedes, acompaño en solidaridad a todos los defensores de derechos humanos de Cuba, Nicaragua y Venezuela, y rezo por la liberación de todos los presos políticos."
"In-person early voting should be easy and convenient for all. The Flint, MI City Clerk's office will be open the last three weekends before Election Day for folks to cast their ballots. It's an example that cities and states across the country should follow."
"Once again, we are called to ask ourselves whether justice could be equally applied in America. But what's clear is that today in America, Black women deserve better."
"In the middle of a global pandemic, President Trump is trying to get the U.S. Supreme Court to eliminate Obamacare and rip health care protections away from 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions.

Don't forget that."
Health care is a right — not a privilege.
"The unrelenting impact of climate change affects every single one of us.

It requires action, not denial. It requires leadership, not scapegoating.

It requires a president to meet the threshold duty of the office — to care, for everyone."
"If I'm elected, I won't wait to take action on COVID-19.

Minutes after the race is called, I’ll call Dr. Fauci and ask him to stay on.

During my transition, I’ll bring together experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.

We will overcome this, together."
"At this moment, we're facing both the worst public health crisis of our lifetime and the existential threat of climate change.

We need a president who believes in science."
"When Ebola hit, President Obama and I took swift action and successfully contained the virus.

After COVID-19 hit, President Trump lied to the American people and said it would miraculously ""disappear.""

Now, over 200,000 lives have been cut short.

It's a national tragedy."
"Supreme Court decisions affect our everyday lives, and the Constitution was designed to give voters a voice on who makes those decisions.

The Senate shouldn't act until after the American people select their next president and the next Congress.

Americans deserve to be heard."
The Senate shouldn't vote until the American people do.
The truth is the economy wasn’t working for folks long before these crises hit. It’s why @KamalaHarris and I won’t just build back to the way things were — we’ll build back better. We won’t be satisfied until the economy starts working for everyone.
"On this Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day, Jill and I are keeping the loved ones of our fallen heroes in our prayers. May we never fail to honor them and carry their spirit with us every day."
"There's no mystery when it comes to what's happening with the Supreme Court. President Trump and Republicans have been trying to throw out Obamacare for years — and now they see an opening to get it done.

We can't let them get away with it."
President Trump can claim he wants to protect people with pre-existing conditions all he wants — but the fact is he’s fighting tooth and nail to take their protections away.
"I'm not looking to punish anyone, but it's about time the super-wealthy and corporate America start paying their fair share."
"The American people understand the urgency of this moment. They're voting in droves because their health care hangs in the balance.

But Donald Trump doesn't care — he sees a chance to eliminate Obamacare and rip away health care protections from millions.

It's unconscionable."
"If we’re elected, @KamalaHarris and I will wake up every single morning to fight for the middle class. For Main Street. For the folks who keep our country running.

We’re going to make our government work for everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected."
"President Trump keeps promising to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, but the truth is he’s in Court trying to rip their protections away.

And now, he’s trying to jam through the confirmation of a Justice who will help him get it done.

We can’t let him win."
It is what it is because Donald Trump is who he is.
"When I hear 200,000 deaths, I think of the empty chairs at dining room tables all across the country, which just months ago were filled by loved ones.

It didn’t have to be this bad."
Donald Trump is the worst president we've ever had.
"Show us your tax returns, @realDonaldTrump."
Donald Trump isn't a law and order president. He's a president who breaks the law and creates disorder.
"Under this president, we’ve become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided, and more violent."
You heard a lot come out of President Trump’s mouth. Can you name one thing he said to actually make your life better?
"White supremacy has no place in America.

We shouldn’t have to beg the President of the United States to say that."
Last night reinforced why I got into this race: We are in a battle for the soul of this nation — and it’s a battle we must win.
"On behalf of Jill and our entire family, I want to wish the Korean-American community a happy Chuseok. May your celebrations be filled with laughter, joy, and plenty of good food. 행복한 한가위 보내세요!"
Jill and I wish a happy Mid-Autumn Festival to all those celebrating. We join you in hoping for a future filled with peace and prosperity — and hope your festivities lead to a bountiful harvest in the year ahead.
"Three years ago today, Las Vegas was struck by tragedy when a gunman opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest Festival. It remains the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

As we remember those we lost, we must take action to ensure it never happens again."
"During Filipino American History Month, we celebrate the community's immense contributions to our country — from early immigrants to the millions today, many who serve in the military or as frontline workers. As President, I'll work alongside them to protect the American people."
"When I first ran for Senate, we put up a billboard that said, “Joe Biden: For all our families.”

It’s a motto that has guided me throughout my career.

It doesn’t matter if you’re a Democrat or Republican—I’ll be a president for all Americans, not just the ones who vote for me."
"Donald Trump will do everything he can to distract from the fact that because of his failed COVID-19 response:

- Over 200,000 Americans have died
- 26 million are on unemployment
- 1 in 6 small businesses risk permanent closure

We can’t let him."
Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family.
"I’m happy to report that Jill and I have tested negative for COVID. Thank you to everyone for your messages of concern. I hope this serves as a reminder: wear a mask, keep social distance, and wash your hands."
"This cannot be a partisan moment.

It must be an American moment.

We have to come together as a nation."
"We can, we will, and we must come together."
"I’m running as a Democrat, but I will be an American president. Whether you voted for me or against me, I will represent you."
"Be a patriot. Do your part.

Wearing a mask will protect you. But it will also protect those around you — your mom, your dad, your son, your daughter, your neighbor, your co-worker.

Don’t just do it for yourself. Do it for the people you love."
"One month until Election Day. Let’s do this, America."
"It's time we come together.

It's time we see each other as fellow Americans, who don't just live in red states and blue states, but who live in — and love — the United States of America.

That's who we are — and there is nothing we cannot do if we do it together."
"At this moment, we’re facing unprecedented crises. But I know the American people have what it takes to overcome them.

There’s not a single thing beyond our capacity."
30 days.
"Before we're Democrats or Republicans or independents — we're Americans.

We can't forget that."
"Imagine a future where:

- Health care is a right
- We end the gun violence epidemic
- We combat climate change
- Our government works for everyone

It’s a future that we can build — together."
"Now that President Trump is busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this: Listen to the scientists. Support masks. Support mask mandates nationwide."
Masks matter. They save lives.
I view wearing a mask as a patriotic duty — to protect those around you. #BidenTownHall
Listen to the scientists.
"Folks, we can save nearly 100,000 lives by the end of the year if everyone wears a mask in public.

Do your part. Protect your neighbors. Wear a mask."
Unity over division.
"As president, I will send a clear, unequivocal message to the entire nation: There is no place for hate in America.

It will be given no license. It will be given no oxygen. It will be given no safe harbor."
I do not believe we have to choose between law and order and racial justice in America.
"The pandemic is not a red state versus blue state issue. The virus doesn’t care where you live or what political party you belong to.

It infects us all. It will take anyone’s life. It is a virus — not a political weapon."
"We fought a Civil War that would secure a Union that would seek to fulfill the promise of equality for all.

And by fits and starts, our better angels have prevailed just enough against our worst impulses to make a new and better nation.

Those better angels must prevail again."
"As president, I will embrace:

Hope, not fear.
Peace, not violence.
Generosity, not greed.
Light, not darkness. 

I will be a president who appeals to the best in us. Not the worst."
"I give you my word: If I am elected president, I will marshal the ingenuity and goodwill of this nation to turn division into unity and bring us together."
"Make no mistake: if you are out of work, if your business is closed, if your child’s school is shut down, if you are seeing layoffs in your community, Donald Trump decided today that none of that matters to him."
"As president, I will:

- Implement nationwide mask mandates
- Ensure access to regular, reliable, and free testing
- Accelerate the development of treatments and vaccines

I won’t waste any time getting this virus under control."
"Folks, I know a thing or two about vice presidential debates.

In 2008, I squared off against Governor Palin. And in 2012, I called out Congressman Ryan's malarkey.

I know @KamalaHarris will do a great job. Join me and tune in at 9 PM ET to cheer her on."
".@KamalaHarris is showing the American people why I chose her as my running mate. She’s smart, she’s experienced, she’s a proven fighter for the middle class. She’ll be an incredible Vice President."
"Let me be clear: A Biden-Harris Administration won't increase taxes by a dime on anyone making less than $400,000 a year."
"Donald Trump has made hate, division, and dog whistles central to his campaign from the very beginning – and last week he couldn't even condemn white supremacists. It’s a pattern."
".@KamalaHarris, you made us all proud tonight."
"We must seek not to build walls, but bridges.

We must seek not to clench our fists, but to open our arms.

We must seek not to tear each other apart, but to come together."
"Folks, there was only one person on last night’s debate stage who’s fit to serve as Vice President — and her name is @KamalaHarris."
"Last night, @KamalaHarris chose truth over lies.

She chose hope and unity over fear and division.

She showed America what true leadership looks like — and I couldn't be prouder."
"When Governor Whitmer worked to protect her state from a deadly pandemic, President Trump issued a call to ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN!""

That call was heard.

He's giving oxygen to the bigotry and hate we see on the march in our country — and we have to stop it."
"What we need in America is leadership that seeks to de-escalate tensions, to open lines of communication, and to bring us together. To heal — and to hope.

As president, that is precisely what I will do."
25 days. Let’s win this thing.
"Why did Donald Trump tell Bob Woodward the truth about COVID-19, but not the American people?"
"It’s estimated that nearly another 200,000 Americans could lose their lives by the end of the year because of this virus.

Enough. No more.

Let’s set the partisanship aside. Let’s end the politics. Let’s follow the science."
"What does building back better mean for you?

- Millions of new, good-paying jobs
- A $15 federal minimum wage
- Stronger benefits and fair workplaces
- An economy that works for everyone—not just the wealthy
- The choice to join a union

That's the future we can build together."
We need a president who understands hardworking Americans — not one who looks down on them.
"The fact is this pandemic has exposed the cracks in our already broken mental health care system.

We can and must do better.

As president, I’ll fight to achieve mental health parity, expand access to care, and wipe out the stigma. #WorldMentalHealthDay"
"America has to be about the possibilities of prosperity. 

Not just for the privileged few. But for the many — for all of us."
"One in five small businesses have closed.
More than 25 million Americans are on unemployment.
Millions are at risk of losing their homes.

But President Trump doesn’t seem to care. He only cares about how he and his wealthy friends are doing."
"I want every member of the LGBTQ+ community to know you are loved and accepted just as you are — whether you've come out or not. I'll fight every day in the White House to create a country where you can live open, proud, and free — without fear. #NationalComingOutDay"
"Today, let's all celebrate the one billion girls and young women around the world — and recommit to fight for their education, work, health, rights, and opportunities. A Biden-Harris administration will work to elevate their voices and ensure an equal future. #DayOfTheGirl"
"Today we join Polish-Americans in celebrating General Pulaski, whose heroism built the American cavalry and saved the life of George Washington. America will always stand with the Polish people against the common threats we face."
"When President Trump was told one thousand Americans were dying every day from COVID-19, he shrugged it off and said, ""it is what it is.""

It is what it is?

This president doesn't even pretend to care about the Americans he swore to serve. It's disgraceful."
"I helped pull this country out of a recession before — and, as president, I’ll do it again."
"From Seneca Falls to Selma to Stonewall, we’re at our best when the promise of America is available to all."
I know Americans aren’t looking for a handout. They just want a fair chance to get ahead — and I’ll work every day to make sure folks get that chance.
"The longer Donald Trump is president, the more reckless he gets."
"Today marks 22 years since Matthew Shepard passed away after a brutal anti-gay hate crime. Over two decades later, violence against LGBTQ+ Americans is at an all-time high. As president, I'll strengthen our hate crimes laws and make clear that bigotry has no place in America."
"On National Farmers Day, we honor the hardworking men and women who drive our economy, fuel our rural communities, and nourish our nation. A Biden-Harris administration will work every day to restore the dignity our farmers deserve and help them build back better than before."
We need a president who will unite our country and bring out our best — not one who stokes division and brings out our worst.
"I am ready to fight for you and for our nation. Every day. Without exception, without reservation. And with a full and devoted heart."
"Three weeks from today, we’re going to make Donald Trump a one-term president."
"Donald Trump has been trying to throw out Obamacare for years.

And now he sees an opportunity to finally get it done, all while ignoring the will of the people.

We can’t let him."
"@KamalaHarris @DouglasEmhoff Happy Birthday, @DouglasEmhoff!"
"215,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 on Donald Trump’s watch. 

It’s the greatest failure of presidential leadership in our nation’s history."
"The election is already underway.

Millions of Americans are voting. 

And they deserve to have their voices heard when it comes to who serves on the U.S. Supreme Court."
I’ll be a president for all Americans. Not just the ones who vote for me.
20 days.
"Donald Trump wants to destroy Obamacare.

I want to protect and build on it.

It’s that simple, folks."
"Today would have been George Floyd’s 47th birthday, and he should be alive to celebrate it.

I made a promise to his family that I won’t let him become just another hashtag — and I’ll work every day as president to keep that promise."
"If President Trump has his way in the U.S. Supreme Court, long-term complications from COVID-19, like lung scarring and heart damage, will become pre-existing conditions that could result in higher premiums or denied coverage.

It’s unconscionable."
"The fact that Senate Republicans haven’t bothered to pass a COVID relief package but are rushing through President Trump’s Supreme Court pick says all you need to know.

We’ve got to flip the Senate, folks."
"This #SpiritDay — and every day — we must stand up to hate and intolerance. It’s up to all of us to ensure every young person is affirmed and accepted just as they are — regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression."
President Obama and I left Donald Trump a booming economy — and he caused a recession. He squandered it just like he has everything else he’s inherited in his life.
"During our contact tracing, we discovered around noon today that a member of the company that charters my airplane has also tested positive for COVID. This crew member was on the plane with me, but was more than 50 feet away. 

My COVID test from last night came back negative."
"Not only was the individual 50+ feet away and wearing a mask, but I was wearing an N-95 mask. No members of my staff were in contact with this crew member either.  My doctors have advised that there is no need for me to quarantine."
"Our campaign’s contact tracing remains ongoing, and my team will continue to share any significant developments with the American people. If anything, let this serve as an example of the importance of wearing masks and keeping a safe, social distance."
"I’m about to step on stage for tonight’s town hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Tune in to @ABC to watch live."
"We're eight months into this pandemic, and Donald Trump still doesn't have a plan to get this virus under control.

I do."
"Over 215,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, and what is President Trump doing?

Nothing."
"The words of a president matter. And when a president doesn't wear a mask or makes fun of folks who do, it has consequences."
"Let me be very clear: If you make under $400,000 you won’t pay a penny more in taxes under my administration."
"Two of the things I've cared about throughout my whole career:

1. Improving the criminal justice system.
2. Putting Black Americans in a position to gain generational wealth.

And as president, I will continue that fight every day."
"We're a diverse country — and unless we are able to treat people equally, we're just never going to meet our potential."
"I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'm going to be an American president. 

I'm going to take care of those who voted against me as well as those who voted for me. 

That's what presidents do."
"How will I ensure the rights of LGBTQ+ people are protected under U.S. law?

I’ll change the law."
"I know times are tough, but I promise our best days still lie ahead. Together, we're going to overcome these crises, unite the country, and build a better future for all."
We need a president who will expand access to health care — not one who does everything he can to tear it away.
"As the Hindu festival of Navratri begins, Jill and I send our best wishes to all those celebrating in the U.S. and around the world. May good once again triumph over evil — and usher in new beginnings and opportunity for all."
"As president, I’ll protect and build on Obamacare by:

- Giving Americans the choice to buy a new public option
- Lowering premiums, deductibles, and co-pays
- Standing up to prescription drug corporations

We’re going to make sure every American has access to the care they need."
"If we do our part, if we stand together, if we keep faith with the past and with each other — then the divisions of our time can give way to the dreams of a brighter, better future. 

That is our work. That is our pledge. That is our mission."
"In the middle of a pandemic, President Trump is trying to eliminate Obamacare and increase health care costs for millions.

Now, he’s rushing through a U.S. Supreme Court justice to help him get it done. It’s unconscionable. 

Make no mistake: Health care is on the ballot."
"A job is about a lot more than a paycheck.

It's about dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything will be okay.

Too many people today can't do that — and it's got to change."
"COVID-19 cases are on the rise across the nation.

But instead of leading by example, Donald Trump continues to put others in danger with his campaign events that ignore expert-recommended precautions.

Every day he proves just how unfit he is to lead America through this crisis."
"From tackling climate change to making community college free for all — I've got big plans for the country.

And I'll pay for them by making sure the super-wealthy, like President Trump, pay more than $750 in federal income taxes."
"We are in a battle for the soul of the nation. 

The forces of darkness, the forces of division, the forces of yesterday are pulling us apart, holding us down, and holding us back.

We must free ourselves of all of them."
Wear a mask. Wash your hands. Vote out Donald Trump.
15 days. Let’s finish strong.
I will be a president who pushes towards the future. Not one who clings to the past.
"Yesterday, @realDonaldTrump decided to attack Dr. Fauci once again, calling him a ‘disaster’ and public health experts ‘idiots.’ Meanwhile, he still has no plan to beat this virus."
"Waving a white flag and saying, “it is what it is” is unacceptable when thousands are dying each week, when businesses are closing, and when schools remain shuttered. The American people have never backed down from a challenge, but they need a leader to show the way."
"Two weeks from today, we’re going to beat President Trump."
"Listening to scientists is not a bad thing.

I can’t believe that has to be said."
"I’ve always believed we’re at our best when we’re one America. If we come together, there’s not a single thing we cannot overcome."
"President Trump didn't take the necessary precautions to protect himself and others.

How can we trust him to protect the country?"
I’m running as a proud Democrat. But I will be an American president.
"Donald Trump sees the world from Park Avenue.

I see it from where I came from: Scranton, Pennsylvania. 

It's why I'll fight every day as president to make this country work for the middle class — not the wealthy and well-connected."
"Folks, the final debate is here. Tune in at 9 PM ET as I go head-to-head with Donald Trump for the last time before Election Day."
"220,000 deaths.

If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this: Anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain President of the United States."
"Learning to live with it? Come on. People are dying with it, Mr. President."
"I’m going to shut down the virus, not the country."
I don’t look at this the way Donald Trump does — blue states or red states. They’re all the United States.
Donald Trump should release his tax returns or shut up about corruption.
Malarkey!
"It’s not about his family or my family. It’s about your family.

If you’re a middle-class family right now, you’re hurting badly."
He’s a confused guy. He doesn’t know who he’s running against. He’s running against Joe Biden.
"All Donald Trump can see from Park Avenue is Wall Street.

He thinks the economy is doing well if the Dow Jones is doing well.

Believe it or not, Mr. President, most Americans don't live off the stock market."
"Equality and justice — the American creed. We have never lived up to it, but we’ve never stopped trying — until this President."
"You know who I am. You know who he is.

The character of the country is on the ballot. Look at us closely."
Donald Trump has a dog whistle about as big as a foghorn.
"I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I will represent you — whether you vote for me or against me."
"64 years ago today, freedom-loving Hungarians revolted against communist rule. Their spirit inspired the Prague Spring, Poland's Solidarity movement, and the fall of the Berlin Wall. As president, I'll always stand in defense of democracy and freedom at home and around the world."
"A slight change of tone from the president for one night doesn’t cover up the lies he told. It doesn’t change the fact that over 220,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 on his watch.

We can’t take another four years of Donald Trump’s failed leadership."
10 days.
President Trump continues to prove just how unfit he is to lead our nation through a global pandemic.
9 days. Let’s go.
"In 8 days, we’re going to take our democracy back."
"No president whose lies and failures have cost 225,000 American lives should keep his job. Period."
More than 60 million Americans have already voted. They deserve to have their voices heard on who replaces Justice Ginsburg.
We can’t let President Trump tear down Obamacare.
Vote.
One week until Election Day. Don’t let up now.
I know this country. I know our people. And I know we can unite and heal this nation.
"The names of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and Jacob Blake will not soon be forgotten.

Not by me. Not by us. Not by this country.

They’re going to inspire a new wave of justice in America."
"Two years ago, a white supremacist entered Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue and perpetrated the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in American history. May the memories of those we lost be a blessing — and may we never stop fighting the scourges of anti-Semitism and gun violence."
"We are the United States of America. We can beat this virus.

There is no challenge we cannot meet, no enemy we cannot face, no threat we cannot conquer when we stand together."
It’s simple: Donald Trump thinks health care is a privilege. I think it is your right.
"Today we celebrate the 80th anniversary of Oxi Day. Greeks inspired the free world when they resisted Mussolini’s invading army — and that courageous spirit lives on today, reminding us we too must stand up and do our part to safeguard our democracy."
"It’s not political.

It’s patriotic.

Wear a mask. Period."
"I believe in science.

Donald Trump doesn't.

It's that simple, folks."
"GDP rose last quarter, but visits to food banks haven’t slowed, and poverty has grown. We’re on track for the worst economic downturn in over 70 years, and Donald Trump is on track to be the first president since Herbert Hoover to leave office with less jobs than when he came in."
5 days. Let’s bring this home.
"Latinas are the heart of our communities — and on Latina Equal Pay Day, we call attention to the fact that they earn only 54 cents for every dollar a white man makes.

A Biden-Harris Administration will build back better for Latinas by taking overdue action to ensure equal pay."
"I join Israelis in honoring Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin z""l, 25 years after his assassination. He led a life of service to his country and its security — and bravely gave his life pursuing peace. I was honored to call him a friend."
Jill and I are keeping the French people in our prayers following the horrific terror attack in Nice — which targeted innocents in a house of worship. A Biden-Harris administration will work with our allies and partners to prevent extremist violence in all forms.
"Las latinas son el corazón de nuestras comunidades y hoy en el Día de la equidad salarial de la mujer latina, reconocemos el hecho de que solo ganan 54 centavos por cada dólar que gana un hombre blanco.

Mi administración luchará para asegurar la igualdad salarial que se merecen."
"Now more than ever, we need a president who will choose compassion over cruelty."
"I'm not going to shut down the country.

I'm not going to shut down the economy.

I'm going to shut down the virus."
"Let me be clear: Hardworking Americans should not be paying more in federal income taxes than Amazon or Netflix.

It’s time for big corporations to finally pay their fair share."
"Jill and I send our prayers to the people of Greece and Turkey following today’s earthquake. We’re grateful for the brave rescuers saving others, and for the governments of Greece and Turkey putting aside their differences to support each other."
Jill and I are praying for all those impacted by Hurricane Zeta. The entire nation stands with you as you rebuild and recover.
"More than 9 million cases of COVID-19 have been now confirmed in the United States — and more than 228,000 Americans have lost their lives.

It is as severe an indictment of a president’s record as one can possibly imagine, and it is utterly disqualifying."
"This Domestic Violence Awareness Month, I recommit to ensuring domestic violence is treated like the crime it is, and to ensuring survivors receive the support they need. I've spent my entire career fighting domestic abuse — and will continue that fight as president. #DVAM"
"President Trump still has no plan to address COVID-19.

He quit on you, on your family, on America. He just wants us to grow numb to the horrors of the death toll and the pain.

We cannot afford another four years of his failed leadership."
"Every single American deserves access to regular, reliable, and free COVID-19 testing. Period."
"3 days.

Stay empowered, stay optimistic, stay united."
President Obama and I left President Trump a playbook on how to deal with pandemics. He flat-out ignored it. And we're suffering every day because of it.
"As president, I will choose: 

Hope, not fear.
Peace, not violence.
Generosity, not greed.
 
I’ll appeal to the best in us, not the worst."
"I want to extend my prayers and condolences to the Chaldean Assyrian Community this 10th anniversary of Our Lady of Deliverance church massacre in Baghdad. The right to worship is fundamental, and as Americans we should be proud that people from around the world find a home here."
"The hard truth is that under President Trump, we’ve become weaker, sicker, poorer, more divided, and more violent."
"The words of a president matter. And time and time again, Donald Trump has callously used his to incite violence, stoke the flames of hatred and division, and drive us further apart.

It’s time for it to end."
"The issues we’re facing are far bigger than any political party.

It’s why I’ll be a president for all Americans — Democrats, Republicans, and Independents alike — because I believe we must work together if we’re going to get anything done."
"As president, I’ll build an economy that rewards work — not just wealth."
"We need to:

Build bridges, not walls.
Open our arms, not clench our fists.
Focus on the ties that bind us together, not tear each other apart.

We need to be what we are at our best: One America."
