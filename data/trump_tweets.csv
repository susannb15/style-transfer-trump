We have all got to come together and win this election. We cant have four more years of Obama (or worse!).
Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!

"Paul Ryan, a man who doesnt know how to win (including failed run four years ago), must start focusing on the budget, military, vets etc."
"The Democrats have a corrupt political machine pushing crooked Hillary Clinton. We have Paul Ryan, always fighting the Republican nominee!"
The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD

Disloyal Rs are far more difficult than Crooked Hillary. They come at you from all sides. They don۪t know how to win - I will teach them!
With the exception of cheating Bernie out of the nom the Dems have always proven to be far more loyal to each other than the Republicans!
It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to.

"Remember, dont believe ""sources said"" by the VERY dishonest media. If they dont name the sources, the sources dont exist."
Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?

"Crazy Maureen Dowd, the wacky columnist for the failing @nytimes, pretends she knows me well--wrong!"
"Wacky @NYTimesDowd, who hardly knows me, makes up things that I never said for her boring interviews and column. A neurotic dope!"
".@CNN just doesnt get it, and thats why their ratings are so low - and getting worse. Boring anti-Trump panelists, mostly losers in life!"
I never met former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. He knows nothing about me. But look at the results under his guidance - a total disaster!
Crooked Hillary wants to take your 2nd Amendment rights away. Will guns be taken from her heavily armed Secret Service detail? Maybe not!
Just arrived in Texas - have been informed two @fortworthpd officers have been shot. My thoughts and prayers are with them.

"The seriously failing @nytimes, despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place, only writes dishonest hits!"
Hillary Clinton just had her 47% moment. What a terrible thing she said about so many great Americans!
"RT @BarackObama: RT if you agree: We need a President who is fighting for all Americans, not one who writes off nearly half the country."
"While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all!"
"Really sad that Republicans would allow themselves to be used in a Clinton ad. Lindsey Graham, Romney, Flake, Sass. SUPREME COURT, REMEMBER!"

"Henry McMaster, Lt. Governor of South Carolina who endorsed me, beat failed @CNN announcer Bakari Sellers, so badly. Funny!"
Jeff Zucker failed @NBC and he is now failing @CNN.
".@CNN is unwatchable. Their news on me is fiction. They
are a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign."
The documentary of me that @CNN just aired is a total waste of time. I dont even know many of the people who spoke about me. A joke!
It wasnt Matt Lauer that hurt Hillary last night. It was her very dumb answer about emails &amp; the veteran who said she should be in jail.
"With Luis, Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the US would have benefitted."
Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Pe̱a Nieto.
Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. She is totally confused. Unfit to serve as #POTUS.
Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. Shes being decimated by the media!

"""Stay on message"" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!"
I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
"It is not ""freedom of the press"" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!"
"I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!"
Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!
My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
"If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didnt put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%"
"The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said"

"Crooked Hillary said loudly, and for the world to see, that she ""SHORT CIRCUITED"" when answering a question on her e-mails. Very dangerous!"
Hillary Clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions. Let us all see what happens!
"The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!"
"Obamas disastrous judgment gave us ISIS, rise of Iran, and the worst economic numbers since the Great Depression!"
President Obama should ask the DNC about how they rigged the election against Bernie.

When will CNN do a segment on Hillary۪s plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost?
Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays &amp; refuses to speak out against Radical Islam.
People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....thats really saying something!
"The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs, or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life."
Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?
When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillarys pay-for-play at State Department?
"CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs."
CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton.
"So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. Thats what I said!"
"When I said in an interview that Putin is ""not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down,"" I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!"
"This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!"
"Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!"

Can you imagine if I had the small crowds that Hillary is drawing today in Pennsylvania. It would be a major media event! @CNN @FoxNews
"Wow, NATOs top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like!"
"The ""Rust Belt"" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!"
"Crookeds stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP"
Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?
"I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!"
"Why doesnt the media want to report that on the two ""Big Thursdays"" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republicans won ratings"
"Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster!"
"Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities."
Just got back from Colorado. The love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible. Big crowds!
We are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years. I want change - Crooked Hillary Clinton does not.
"Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters. Her foreign wars,
NAFTA/TPP support &amp; Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes."
"Colorado was amazing yesterday! So much support. Our tax, trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to Colorado and the whole country."
"As usual, Hillary &amp; the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games. Same as last time w/ Bernie. Unacceptable!"
Hillary Clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement &amp; insticts.
"I am watching Crooked Hillary speak. Same old stuff, our country needs change!"
"Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary. She sold them out, V.P. pick!"
The dishonest media didnt mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crookeds speech. He wishes he didnt make that deal!
"Crooked Hillary said that I ""couldnt handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign."" Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!"
"If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldnt get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town!  #NeverHillary"
"""Little"" Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!"
"General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD  #NeverHillary"
Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!
"""@AnnCoulter: ""I believe in science"" Dem code for ""were shutting down coal mines, steel plants and any other remaining manufacturing"""""
"Two policemen just shot in San Diego, one dead. It is only getting worse. People want LAW AND ORDER!"
"Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and ""forgot"" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!"
The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD!
No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.
"Hillarys wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world."
"Hillarys vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety."
Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!
Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
"Hillarys refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country."
Median household income is down for the middle class since Obama took office. It will only go further down under Clinton.
"A vote for Clinton-Kaine is a vote for TPP, NAFTA, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees."
"RT @piersmorgan: Trump makes a funny, obvious joke about Russia going after Hillarys emails &amp; U.S. media goes insane with fury.
He plays t_"
President Obama spoke last night about a world that doesn۪t exist. 70% of the people think our country is going in the wrong direction. #DNC
"""@trumplican2016: @realDonaldTrump @DavidWohl stay the course mr trump your message is resonating with the PEOPLE"""
"""@DavidWohl: Barack is offended that @realDonaldTrump will demand that #NATO allies pay their fair share. #DemsInPhilly"""
"Our country does not feel great already to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty, violence and despair."
Shooting deaths of police officers up 78% this year. We must restore law and order and protect our great law enforcement officers!
"If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clintons 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!"
Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic
"Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to ""carpet bomb"" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!"
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!
Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!
The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!
"Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said ""Trump is a genius."" America 1st!"
"As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv."
Many of Bernies supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?
"I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!"
"No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!"
"You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. @megynkelly"
"For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia."
"In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy!"
Dems dont want to talk ISIS b/c Hillarys foreign interventions unleashed ISIS &amp; her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.
"Bernies exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!"
The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!
Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch.
"Why arent the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great"
"Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference"
"Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time."
"Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!"
Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.
"If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself."
I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!
"Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!"
"While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers."
"Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War."
"Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People dont want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA"
The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!
"Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!"
"Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!"
"Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her ""servant"" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, thats all! They laughed at Bernie."
"If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same."
Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
"How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!"
"The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me"
Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix Americas problems. ISIS &amp; all others laughing!
"The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!"
"The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, shes out!"
The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well!
"Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I dont believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!"
"Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out"
"If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild"
"The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Dont watch CNN!"
"I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!"
"Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)"
"Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just cant go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!"
"There is no longer a Bernie Sanders ""political revolution."" He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!"
An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
"Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!"
"Wow, President Obamas brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!"
"Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT"
The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!
"""@NancyNielsenn: @realDonaldTrump Dinesh DSousa Hillarys America. see it"""
Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!
"The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!"
Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They dont look presidential to me!
I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People havent had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!
Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!
Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!
Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.
"Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED"
"Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasnt chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!"
"Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!"
"The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?"
"""@Theresa_Cali: @realDonaldTrump General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain"""
I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.
Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didnt get indicted while Bob M did?
"Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich."
"One of the best produced, including the incredible stage &amp; set, in the history of conventions. Great unity! Big T.V. ratings! @KarlRove"
Thank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times!
What a great four days in Cleveland. So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all. The police and Secret Service were fantastic!
"Other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses, the party is VERY united. Great love in the arena!"
"Ted Cruz talks about the Constitution but doesnt say that if the Dems win the Presidency, the new JUSTICES appointed will destroy us all!"
"I am soooo proud of my children, Don, Eric and Tiffany - their speeches, under enormous pressure, were incredible. Ivanka intros me tonight!"
"Arena was packed, totally electric!"
.@mike_pence was fantastic tonight. Will be a great V.P.
"Wow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage, didnt honor the pledge! I saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway. No big deal!"
Thank you to Governor @ScottWalker for such warm support. Great speech!
"Watching the #GOPConvention
#AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE"
John Kasich was never asked by me to be V.P. Just arrived in Cleveland - will be a great two days!
The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melanias speech than the FBI spent on Hillarys emails.
Good news is Melanias speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!
"In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!"
Bill Hemmer of @FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.
"Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you!"
Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States. I will work hard and never let you down! AMERICA FIRST!
The ROLL CALL is beginning at the Republican National Convention. Very exciting!
"""@RoxaneTancredi:  Democrats are coming to TRUMP. I used to be proud of the dem party. No more It is crooked and not for the people."""
"It was truly an honor to introduce my wife, Melania. Her speech and demeanor were absolutely incredible. Very proud! #GOPConvention"
Will be on @OreillyFactor tonight at 8:30pm @FoxNews- prior to Melanias speech at the #GOPConvention. Tune in- she will do great! #RNCinCLE
Networks other than low ratings @CNN have been very fair and exciting!
".@CNN is the worst.They go to their dumb, one-sided panels when a podium speaker is for Trump! VAST MAJORITY want: Make America Great Again!"
"Looking forward to being at the convention tonight to watch all of the wonderful speakers including my wife, Melania. Place looks beautiful!"
"President Obama just had a news conference, but he doesnt have a clue. Our country is a divided crime scene, and it will only get worse!"
"Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching. We are not looking good, we are not looking smart, we are not looking tough!"
I will be on @60Minutes tonight at 7:00 P.M. with Mike Pence talking about LAW AND ORDER and many other subjects! Bad times for divided USA!
"We are TRYING to fight ISIS, and now our own people are killing our police. Our country is divided and out of control. The world is watching"
The ratings at @FoxNews blow away the ratings of @CNN - not even close. Thats because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people dont like
".@FoxNews is much better, and far more truthful, than @CNN, which is all negative. Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary! I dont watch."
"If Goofy Elizabeth Warren, a very weak Senator, didnt lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today. Pick her H"
"I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud!"
"It doesnt matter that Crooked Hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement!"
"As the days and weeks go by,  we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions!"
We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again!
"Goofy Elizabeth Warren, who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate, must prove she is not a fraud. Without the con its over"
"Thank you to Jack Morgan, Tamara Neo, Cheryl Ann Kraft and all of my friends and supporters in Virginia. GREAT JOB!"
Thank you to Chris Cox and Bikers for Trump - Your support has been amazing. I will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street, lobbyists and special interests. She will sell our country down the tubes!"
"Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes, Crooked Hillary Clinton, can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money!"
"Crooked Hillary, who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies, has been a DISASTER on foreign policy. Look whats happening!"
"Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I dont have foreign policy experience, yet look what her policies have done"
Look forward to introducing Governor Mike Pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great State of Indiana). My first choice from start!
Look forward to Governor Mike Pence V.P. introduction tomorrow in New York City.
I am pleased to announce that I have chosen Governor Mike Pence as my Vice Presidential running mate. News conference tomorrow at 11:00 A.M.
Four more years of weakness with a Crooked Hillary Administration is not acceptable. Look what has happened to the world with O &amp; Hillary!
#NeverTrump is never more. They were crushed last night in Cleveland at Rules Committee by a vote of 87-12. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"My prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in Nice, France. We are with you in every way!"
"In light of the horrible attack in Nice, France, I have postponed tomorrows news conference concerning my Vice Presidential announcement."
"Another horrific attack, this time in Nice, France. Many dead and injured. When will we learn? It is only getting worse."
"I employ many people in the State of Virginia - JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! Crooked Hillary will sell us out, just like her husband did with NAFTA."
I will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan. Details to follow.
"If I win the Presidency, we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions!"
Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking?
Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!
On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.
Voters understand that Crooked Hillarys negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.
Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide @QuinnipiacPoll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!!
Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves? Think about it and let me know!
"The Republican platform is most
pro-Israel of all time!"
New GOP platform now includes language that supports the border wall. We will build the wall and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot - resign!
I will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @FoxNews at 8pm. Enjoy!
"To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals &amp; global special interests, we welcome you with open arms. People first."
Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.
I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out!
"Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!"
"This election is a choice between law, order &amp; safety - or chaos, crime &amp; violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYou"
"For too many years, our inner cities have been left behind. I am going to deliver jobs, safety and protection for those in need."
"Crime is out of control, and rapidly getting worse. Look what is going on in Chicago and our inner cities. Not good!"
"Thoughts and prayers with the victims, and their families- along with everyone at the Berrien County Courthouse in St. Joseph, Michigan."
"I heard that the underachieving John King of @CNN on Inside Politics was one hour of lies. Happily, few people are watching - dead network!"
"The media is so dishonest. If I make a statement, they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.They think the public is stupid!"
President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!
Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton. We are a divided nation!
Way to go @serenawilliams  - you are a true champion. Proud of you!
Isnt it sad that on a day of national tragedy Hillary Clinton is answering softball questions about her email lies on @CNN?
"Due to the horrific events taking place in our country, I have decided to postpone my speech on economic opportunity- today in Miami."
Prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country
"After today, Crooked Hillary can officially be called Lyin Crooked Hillary."
Just leaving D.C. Had great meetings with Republicans in the House and Senate. Very interesting day! These are people who love our country!
Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow. Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live.
"I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton. Check it out Sleepy Eyes, @MarkHalperin @NBCPolitics"
"Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C."
Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.
"Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center, Airport - and destroyed City"
"I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies."
"Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come!"
"Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement."
"Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team ""were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information."" Not fit!"
Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!
"I dont think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with ""murder."" Come November 8, shes out!"
Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win
I will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @FoxNews at 11pm. Enjoy!
"My son, @EricTrump will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm on @FoxNews. Enjoy!"
Looking forward to meeting with @SenBobCorker in a little while. We will be traveling to North Carolina together today.
FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem
"The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment."
It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again!
Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!
"On @FoxNews at 7:00 P.M. ""Special: Meet the Trumps"" Hope you enjoy!"
Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?
"With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, wont even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!"
"Crooked Hillary Clinton is ""guilty as hell"" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails?"
The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked!
I look forward to meeting @joniernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!
"Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed, great people!"
"Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was solid!"
"Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriffs Star, or plain star!"
Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!
"The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!"
"In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!"
I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!
"The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting ""go away, no pictures."""
"Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about ""grandkids"" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?"
"""THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!"""
"On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!"
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged &amp; corrupt!
Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.
"Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good news-the people get it!"
"It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged!"
It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!
"The speakers slots at the Republican Convention are totally filled, with a long waiting list of those that want to speak - Wednesday release"
"Just read in the failing @nytimes that I was not aware ""the event had to be held in Cleveland"" - a total lie. These people are sick!"
Just returned from Colorado. Amazing crowd!
.@TraceAdkins great job on FOX this morning. Keep up the good work!
Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?
Bill Clintons meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.
"As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bills meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!"
I will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm on FOX! Enjoy!
"The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan!
The very dishonest @NBCNews refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal!
New book by @ericbolling is absolutely terrific and a must read! #WakeUpAmerica
"For reasons only they can explain, the @USChamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better."
Tremendous day in Massachusetts and Maine. Thank you to everyone for making it so special!
"""@Gengm7: @jakeda @realDonaldTrump As of April this year, Hillary had spent $264,000,000 on her campaign Mr.Trump $55,000,000. self funding"""
I will be on @oreillyfactor at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy!
ISIS exploded on Hillary Clintons watch- shes done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!
Just watched Senator John Barrasso on @FoxNews - He was great! Thank you John.
Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters?
"The @USCHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker. China, and many others, are taking advantage of U.S. with our terrible trade pacts"
Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though Im sure he would do a good job if he was. The media makes everything up!
"""@jtsbk:  @AllenWest thanks for sharing Eric we need @realDonaldTrump now as this administration is incapable of keeping our country safe"""
We must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the United States.
"Yet another terrorist attack, this time in Turkey. Will

.@CNN is all negative when it comes to me. I dont watch it anymore.
"The media is unrelenting. They will only go with and report a story in a negative light. I called Brexit (Hillary was wrong), watch November"
"Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U.S. Senate, goofy Elizabeth Warren, who lied on heritage."
"""@LindaSuhler: Trump voters dont scare or back down. Our numbers are growing &amp; were taking our country BACK. #Trump2016__ #MAGA"
"""@JimVitari:  @ABC @washingtonpost we know theyre fake just like poles during primary. Im sure u will crush #CrookedHillary in general"""
"The ""dirty"" poll done by @ABC @washingtonpost is a disgrace. Even they admit that many more Democrats were polled. Other polls were good."
Crooked Hillary Clinton got Brexit wrong. I said LEAVE will win. She has no sense of markets and such bad judgement. Only a question of time
"Hillary Clinton is not a change agent, just the same old status quo! She is spending a fortune, I am spending very little. Close in polls!"
"People in our country want borders, and without them the old line pols like Crooked Hillary will not win. It is time for CHANGE -- and JOBS!"
The @ABC poll sample is heavy on Democrats.  Very dishonest - why would they do that? Other polls good!
"Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry. Shows me hitting shot, but I never did = lie! Was there to support son"
Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads. Disgraceful!
"Crooked Hillary Clinton, who called BREXIT 100% wrong (along with Obama), is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call."
"George Will, one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago), has left the Republican Party.Hes made many bad calls"
"Just landed in New York - a one night stay in Scotland. Turnberry came out magnificently. My son, Eric, did a great job - under budget!"
Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs. That ends when I am President!
I have never liked the media term mass deportation -- but we must enforce the laws of the land!
We only want to admit those who love our people and support our values. #AmericaFirst
We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.
"So funny, Crooked Hillary called BREXIT so incorrectly, and now she says that she is the one to deal with the U.K. All talk, no action!"

"The opening of Trump Turnberry in Scotland was a big success. Good timing, I was here for BREXIT. Very exciting news conference today!"
Crooked Hillary called it totally wrong on BREXIT - she went with Obama - and now she is saying we need her to lead. She would be a disaster

Leaving now for a one night trip to Scotland in order to be at the Grand Opening of my great Turnberry Resort. Will be back on Sat. night!

Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief! She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy!
I will be interviewed by @LouDobbs tonight on @FoxBusiness 7pm ET
"Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt, dangerous, dishonest."
"If you want to know about Hillary Clintons honesty &amp; judgment, ask the family of Ambassador Stevens."
Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays.
"I am ""the king of debt.""That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S."
Hillary Clintons open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe.
How can Hillary run the economy when she cant even send emails without putting entire nation at risk?
"Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as
Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs."
"Hillary says this election is about judgment.  Shes right.  Her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy."
I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.
"Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess!"

I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use!
What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough
"""@WandaWalls20: @realDonaldTrump Please make us safe. We cannot have Hillary as president. We will be in so much trouble."
"Reporting that Orlando killer shouted ""Allah hu Akbar!"" as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade."
Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesnt he should immediately resign in disgrace!
"Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I dont want congrats, I want toughness &amp; vigilance. We must be smart!"
"Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims &amp; their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart &amp; vigilant?"
Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!
Really bad shooting in Orlando. Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded.

We just had the worst jobs report since 2010.
The Mayor of San Jose did a terrible job of ordering the  protection of innocent people. The thugs were lucky supporters remained peaceful!
Many of the thugs that attacked the peaceful Trump supporters in San Jose were illegals. They burned the American flag and laughed at police
Muhammad Ali is dead at 74! A truly great champion and a wonderful guy. He will be missed by all!
"Great evening in San Jose other than the thugs. My supporters are far tougher if they want to be, but fortunately they are not hostile."
So much interest in my visit to Scotland! I greatly look forward to attending the opening event @TrumpTurnberry- taking place on June 24th.
"In Crooked Hillarys telepromter speech yesterday, she made up things that I said or believe but have no basis in fact. Not honest!"
"I dont watch or do @Morning_Joe anymore. Small audience, low ratings! I hear Mika has gone wild with hate. Joe is Joe. They lost their way!"
"Rally last night in San Jose was great. Tremendous love and enthusiasm in the hall. Big crowd. Outside, small group of thugs burned Am flag!"
"Terrible jobs report just reported. Only 38,000 jobs added. Bombshell!"

Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesnt even look presidential!
Crooked Hillary no longer has credibility - too much failure in office. People will not allow another four years of incompetence!
"Crooked Hillary Clinton, who I would love to call Lyin Hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions."
"After the litigation is disposed of and the case won, I have instructed my execs to open Trump U(?), so much interest in it! I will be pres."
"Even though I have a very biased and unfair judge in the Trump U civil case in San Diego, I have thousands of great reviews &amp; will win case!"
"With all of the Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign policy experience, she has made so many mistakes - and I mean real monsters! No more HRC."
"Wow, USA Today did todays cover story on my record in lawsuits. Verdict: 450 wins, 38 losses. Isnt that what you want for your president?"
Do you ever notice that @CNN gives me very little proper representation on my policies. Just watched-nobody knew anything about my foreign P
Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from BAD judgement!

"Same failing @nytimes ""reporter"" who wrote discredited womens story last week wrote another terrible story on me today- will never learn!"
Crooked Hillary Clinton is a fraud who has put the public and country at risk by her illegal and very stupid use of e-mails. Many missing!
"So I raised/gave $5,600,000 for the veterans and the media makes me look bad! They do anything to belittle - totally biased."
Congratulations to @seanhannity on his tremendous increase in television ratings. Speaking of ratings- I will be on his show tonight @ 10pE.
I am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days.
"Katie Couric, the third rate reporter, who has been largely forgotten, should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc."
I will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 10pmE on @FoxNews. Enjoy!
So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave! It was my great honor - they do an amazing job.
"Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5,600,000 that I raised/gave!"
"I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS, and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. Watch!"

"""@FrankyLamouche: how many of donalds rolling thunder brigade will sign up and go to war for him in the middle east."""
"The endorsement of me by the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Nice!"
"In getting the endorsement of the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you), the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!"
Obama says a WALL at our southern border wont enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H.
"If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent, say good bye to the Supreme Court!"
The Republican Party has to be smart &amp; strong if it wants to win in November. Cant allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!
"Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser, but if the GOP cant control their own, then they are not a party. Be tough, Rs!"
Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do.
Heading to D.C. to see and hear ROLLING THUNDER. Amazing people that LOVE OUR COUNTRY. Great spirit!
Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country! We love them.
Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while hes in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW
Dont believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!
"I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes, but when I won the GOP nomination, Im in the back of the paper. Very dishonest!"
The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money &amp; get much better results! What we need as Prez!
"The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style &amp; that I dont have many people. I have 73, Hillary has 800- &amp; Im beating her."
I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go! Thank you.
"The U.S. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. How nice, but what do we get? NOT ENOUGH"

"Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates, overtaxes and doesnt care about jobs. Most importantly, she suffers from plain old bad judgement!"
"I just released my financial disclosure forms, the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great!"
"Amazingly, with all of the money I have raised for the vets, I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media."
"Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed, with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups."
"While under no obligation to do so, I have raised between 5 &amp; 6 million dollars, including 1million dollars from me, for our VETERANS. Nice!"

Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500% increase in Syrian refugees. We can۪t allow this. Time to get smart and protect America!
"How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam, which horribly oppresses women?"
Why do the networks continue to put dopey @BillKristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs?

"How can Crooked Hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for NAFTA, the worst economic deal in U.S. history?"
"Crooked Hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy.If so, he should run,not her.Will he bring the ""energizer"" to D.C.?"
Crooked Hillary cant close the deal with Bernie Sanders. Will be another bad day for her!
Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history
Oregon is voting today. Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Cant believe she would misrepresent the facts! My hit was on China
"The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. ""You can tell them to go BLANK themselves"" - was about China, NOT WOMEN!"
"Wow, 30,000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?"
"What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly, and for years, trying to come back. I said no."

"The writer of the now proven false story in the @nytimes, Michael Barbaro, who was interviewed on CBS this morning, was unable to respond."
Over 50 women were interviewed by the @nytimes yet they only wrote about 6. That۪s because there were so many positive statements.
"No wonder the @nytimes is failingwho can believe what they write after the false, malicious &amp; libelous story they did on me."
The failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women.
"With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing @nytimes hit piece on me, we have exposed the article as a fraud!"
"A political commentator for @cnn, which I no longer watch, said ""Trump showed some weakness in the Repub Primaries."" I set all-time record!"
"Wow, Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday, was on @foxandfriends saying Times lied"
"The @nytimes is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer, who said it was a lie!"
"The @nytimes is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Roseanne Brewer, who said it was a lie!"
That was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends - I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is!
"Wow, Rosanne Brewer Lane, the most prominently depicted women in the failing @nytimes story yesterday,is on @foxandfriends saying Times lied"
"Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems. The system is rigged against him. He should run as an independent! Run Bernie, run."
The @washingtonpost report on potential VP candidates is wrong. Marco Rubio and most others mentioned are NOT under consideration.
"The media is really on a witch-hunt against me. False reporting, and plenty of it - but we will prevail!"
Why did the failing @nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers. DISHONEST!
"Wow, I have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing @nytimes piece. Massive front page for that!"
Why doesnt the failing @nytimes write the real story on the Clintons and women? The media is TOTALLY dishonest!

"In interview I told @AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete, not after election!"
Isn۪t it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump &amp; gets nothing done in Senate?
Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See mediaasking for increase!
"Our Native American Senator, goofy Elizabeth Warren, couldn۪t care less about the American worker_does nothing to help!"
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the woman۪s card like her friend crooked Hillary. See her dumb tweet when a woman stands up to you_۝
"If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been, she would lose!"
Goofy Elizabeth Warren didn۪t have the guts to run for POTUS. Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold.
Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate. She has done nothing!
I dont want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary. His time will come!
"Big wins in West Virginia and Nebraska. Get ready for November - Crooked Hillary, who is looking very bad against Crazy Bernie, will lose!"
The Clintons spend millions on negative ads on me &amp; I can۪t tell the truth about her husband? Don۪t feel sorry for crooked Hillary!
It was so great being in Nebraska last week. Today is the big day--get out and vote!
"I look very much forward to meeting w/Paul Ryan &amp; the GOP Party Leadership on Thurs in DC. Together, we will beat the Dems at all levels!"
It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position.
"It was Rosie ODonnell who ate the cake in the vicious Hillary commercial about me, not Crooked Hillary! @marthamaccallum"
"Why does the media, with a strong push from Crooked Hillary, keep pushing the false narrative that I want to raise taxes. Exactly opposite!"
. #RepMikeKelly  Great job on @foxandfriends this morning. Thank you for the nice words!
"Get out and vote Nebraska, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"Get out and vote West Virginia, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate. Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current!
I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party --despite having to compete against 17 other people!
"If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton, I would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did!"

"Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name?"
Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! Im driving her nuts.
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.
"Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy."
"Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton۪s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American."
Let۪s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren۪s records to see if she is Native American. I say she۪s a fraud!
I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.
I hear @JoeNBC of rapidly fading @Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win.

"The Cruz-Kasich pact is under great strain. This joke of a deal is falling apart, not being honored and almost dead. Very dumb!"
On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!
Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - cant make a deal work.
Shows how weak and desperate Lyin Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly cant stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
Lyin Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!
Lyin Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors &amp; special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!
"Wow, just announced that Lyin Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!"
I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant!

I met Prince on numerous occasions. He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. He will be greatly missed!
Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldnt get to 1237. Now he cant get to 1237. Drop out LYIN Ted.
Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!
Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!

Lyin۪ Ted Cruz even voted against Superstorm Sandy aid and September 11th help. So many New Yorkers devastated. Cruz hates New York!
Kasich only looks O.K. in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him
Lyin Ted Cruz cant win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses-I am millions of VOTES ahead! Hillary would destroy him &amp; K
"""@DiamondandSilk: .@realDonaldTrump is who we need 2 fix this corrupted, rigged system. 4 no Profit, Under budget &amp; ahead of schedule."

Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesnt want to run against. Will be such fun!

Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration.

"I know the ""Governors"" and Jeb Bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain!"
"Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION (""come as act of love""). Not a leader!"
"Now that Bush has wasted $120 million of special interest money on his failed campaign, he says he would end super PACs. Sad!"
Everybody is laughing at Jeb Bush-spent $100 million and is at bottom of pack. A pathetic figure!
Jeb Bush is desperate - strongly in favor of #CommonCore and very weak on illegal immigration.
Jeb Bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a Super Bowl ad. He is a weak candidate!
"My two wonderful sons, Don and Eric, will be on @foxandfriends at 7:02 - now! Enjoy."

"Cruz says I supported TARP, which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs, the bank which loaned him the money he didnt disclose. Puppet!"
The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesnt like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!
".@BrentBozell, one of the National Review lightweights, came to my office begging for money like a dog. Why doesnt he say that?"
"Just watched Jebs ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him. Jeb --- mom cant help you with ISIS, the Chinese or with Putin."
Ted Cruz went down big in just released Reuters poll - whats going on? Is it Goldman Sachs/Citi loans or Canada?
"Rush Limbaugh is great, tells it as he sees it---really honorable guy! Thanks Rush! #Trump2016"
The tax scam Washington Post does among the most inaccurate stories of all. Really dishonest reporting.
Wow! New National Zogby Poll just out:.TRUMP 45. CRUZ 13. RUBIO 8. Big numbers.
Leaving Nevada now for Iowa. Things are looking good - great new polls!

"""@Lisa_Milicaj: Truth be told, I  never heard of The National Review until they ""tried"" to declare war on you. No worries, you got my vote!"""
"After spending $89 million, @JebBush is at the bottom of the barrel in polls. He is ashamed to use the name ""Bush"" in ads. Low energy guy!"
The failing @NRO National Review Magazine has just been informed by the Republican National Committee that they cannot participate in debate
"Highly respected Constitutional law professor Mary Brigid McManamon has just stated, ""Ted Cruz is not eligible to be President."" Big problem"

"The late, great, William F. Buckley would be ashamed of what had happened to his prize, the dying National Review!"
"Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize, but not how to lead."
National Review is a failing publication that has lost its way. Its circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low. Sad!
"Why does @Greta have a fired Bushy like dummy, John Sununu on- spewing false info? I will beat Hillary by a lot, she wants no part of Trump."
"Happy birthday to my friend, the great @jacknicklaus - a totally special guy!"
New Day on CNN treats me very badly. @AlisynCamerota is a disaster. Not going to watch anymore.
"I will be speaking at South Point Hotel in Las Vegas at 1:00 P.M. Get there early, big crowd expected!"
Low energy candidate @JebBush has wasted $80 million on his failed presidential campaign. Millions spent on me. He should go home and relax!
"Sad sack @JebBush has just done another ad on me, with special interest money, saying I wont beat Hillary - I WILL. But he cant beat me."
So sad that @CNN and many others refused to show the massive crowd at the arena yesterday in Oklahoma. Dishonest reporting!
"""@AmericanAsPie:  @glennbeck @SarahPalinUSA Remember when Glenn gave out gifts to ILLEGAL ALIENS at crossing the border? Me too!"""
"Wacko @glennbeck is a sad answer to the @SarahPalinUSA endorsement that Cruz so desperately wanted. Glenn is a failing, crying, lost soul!"

"Wow, new polls just out have Trump up and Cruz down - he is a nervous wreck!"
.@TheBrodyFile great job on @AC360. Thank you for the very smart and kind words!
I dont think Ted Cruz can even run for President until he can assure Republican voters that being born in Canada is not a problem. Doubt!
Ted Cruz is falling in the polls. He is nervous. People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks!
Leaving for Liberty University. Ill be speaking today in front of a record crowd. #Trump2016
"""@pbralick: @BenKissel great on @greggutfeld @GregGutfeldShow @JoNosuchinsky too""  Thank you Ben for your nice comments on debate!"
"I am self-funding my campaign - putting up my own money, not controlled.  Cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his N.Y. bosses."
"Far more killed than anticipated in radical Islamic terror attack yesterday. Get tough and smart U.S., or we wont have a country anymore!"
"Iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them...but they wont buy from U.S., rather Airbus!"
"In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners. They get $150 billion, 7 most wanted and many off watch list. This will create great incentive for others!"
"Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions, $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul, &amp; $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite"
Greatly dishonest of @TedCruz to file a financial disclosure form &amp; not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St
When will @TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.
"Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!"
"If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?"
"Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!"
"Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a ""natural born Canadian,"" did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?"
"Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didnt report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate."
"The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wifes employer, and his lender, is located there!"
"Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!"
"Ted Cruz said he ""didnt know"" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable"
Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so
"More radical Islam attacks today - it never ends! Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. No more being politically correct."

"Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters, try getting a new publisher!"
UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They arent worthy of representing the great people NH.

Why does the failing @WSJ write a false editorial about me and let dummy @KarlRove make the same mistake in the same edition of the paper?
.@KarlRove is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re China and TPP. This moron wasted $430 million on political campaigns and lost 100%
"We, as a country, either have borders or we dont. IF WE DONT HAVE BORDERS, WE DONT HAVE A COUNTRY!"
Why wouldnt the @WSJ call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong. No wonder it is doing poorly!
"When and how are the dummies at the @WSJ going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect Editorial on me. I want ""smart"" trade deals."
"The @WSJ Editorial Board is so wrong, so often. They got info from an incorrect story in another pub. Why not watch and listen to debate."

One of the reasons I am no fan of John McCain is that our Vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians. I will fix VA quickly.
"Why would anybody listen to @MittRomney? He lost an election that should have easily been won against Obama. By the way,so did John McCain!"
"Congrats to the new Gov. of Texas, @GregAbbott_TX, for taking a tough &amp; bold stance at the border. Should have been done long ago by Perry."
I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans. Veterans deserve universal access to care. VA scandal proves politicians are inept.
....that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care.
Its a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans.....
I will make this right for our great Vets!
"All he does is go on television is talk, talk, talk, but incapable of doing anything."
....John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives.
The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years...
"Captured or not, all our soldiers are heroes!"
"In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets, John McCain let us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President!"
