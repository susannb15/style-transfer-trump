It must be clearly stated and signalled to the candidate countries that the Irish people in no way wanted to reject enlargement .
The report ascribes this state of affairs to secondary causes and avoids tackling the root cause of the problem .
I have also offered - it was only been tabled very late on Thursday of last week - a new amendment which I have discussed with the rapporteur and which specifically looks at a number of exclusions .
As a result , commitment to the correction of inequalities at source , by reinforcing development cooperation , is the first point .
A balance must be found between fair competition and entrepreneurial freedom , and so I can only say that our proposal on self @-@ handling is the right one .
That is not what I want at all .
The hole in the ozone layer has increased in size by 20 @-@ 25 % during the past two years alone .
I would say that this project has to be tackled along the same lines as we tackled the large internal market project of the European Union .
Mr President , as it has indicated in previous answers on the same subject , the Council fully shares your concerns regarding the humanitarian catastrophe in Afghanistan .
Passenger transport by rail , road and inland waterway
in writing . - How is this still going on ?
I am pleased with the Commission &apos;s conclusion that compliance with reporting requirements in the agricultural sector has already reached 95 % .
We can only regret the fact that the United States has introduced a tax on steel imports , at the expense of European interests and which apparently violates WTO rules .
For it is in that Forum that we said that we need ports , suppliers , classification systems , scientific institutes , oceanography , etc . We need all that to establish a system that works .
In Belarus we have a president who does not understand the signs of the times , who wants to leads Belarus back into a structural conservatism that no longer exists and I hope will never again exist in that form , by government control of industry and banking , by intervening in the democratic constitutional system , by questioning national independence and by restricting freedom of opinion , freedom of the press and the rights of the unions .
It is important and essential to promote early diagnosis and a good quality of life , to support cooperation between the Member States through sharing best practices and clinical studies in this field , and to respect the rights and expectations of people living with this difficult disease .
The House will recall , as Mr González Triviño and others said , that after the tragic accident at Puerto Plata in February last year in which 176 European Union citizens were killed , both the European Parliament and the Council asked the Commission to study possible measures to improve safety .
We need to unite around common values , such as , I would emphasise , law .
We are following the situation very closely and I share your concerns .
That was not how things turned out .
I am glad that this is being done in this case and I hope they respond to some of the external evaluations and the Commission evaluation .
I would like to remind you that the Raimon Obiols i Germà and Charles Tannock report will be put to the vote tomorrow morning , and that the texts submitted to close the debate on the Council and Commission statements will be put to the vote in Brussels on 29 November 2007 .
Mrs Roure has asked for general information about the London meeting : I shall be pleased to provide it to the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs next week , when I shall go into much more detail . Positive profiling is an initiative that was not started today or yesterday , but rather a few months ago .
Because the ministers are going to be talking about this very shortly and I should like to be sure , and this was the only reason for having this debate , that they can take on board the decisions which Parliament will have reached .
.
The next item is Question Time ( B6 @-@ 0019 / 2008 ) .
The total surplus for those three years amounts to some 23 000 billion .
The situation is no longer the same as it was at the start of the survey carried out by the Commission .
Private equity companies will have to give notification of their presence in the companies acquired and provide information to employees , in particular , concerning their future strategy for the business and the potential repercussions for jobs .
Turning to matters relating to economics and trade , the principle of avoiding further discussion on ongoing contentious issues was retained . Revisiting such issues often only results in overshadowing the significance of the strong economic links between the European Union and the United States .
( Applause )
Question No 1 by Bart Staes ( H @-@ 0265 / 02 ) :
We have 10 months left before the Treaty enters into force .
I agree with the comments made here regarding the extension of qualified majority voting .
Thus , here , too , it is a question of environmental responsibility .
This will simply make the gap wider .
I happen to be of the opinion that the rights of the children should be safeguarded , although that is up to the parents .
Thank you .
If we really want to safeguard and develop industrial employment in the European Union , if we want to avoid misleading European consumers and to protect their health , if we want to prolong the social and environmental acquis of our societies , there is an urgent need to make the origin marking of manufactured products compulsory , even if it means encroaching on the ultraliberal founding dogmas of Europe . This marking must be serious and not a form of deception which entails presenting a product as having been &apos; made in Europe &apos; when it is , in fact , nothing more than an assembly of parts from all over the world , with only the label having been &apos; made in Europe &apos; .
The report very much welcomes the fact that the European authorities are increasingly taking action to settle a complaint once they are made aware of the problem in question and that , in other cases , a friendly solution has been arrived at .
I am talking about figures who each individually command international authority and who are therefore able to attract publicity .
This is not really a theoretical question in this day and age .
But I would add that , on the whole , television coverage is not an issue which is regulated by the Presidency . I wish it were regulated by the Presidency and by the House .
It has initiated a new European policy - the Baltic Sea strategy .
What this House is doing today is an expression of its innate responsibility for the defence of human rights , and not just of any old right , but of what is perhaps the most ancient human right known to man , the right of asylum , which can be seen as derived from the laws of hospitality , and which was , to the most ancient of human cultures , sacrosanct .
That is very important .
This report demands a change in global governance and in the EU in order to better implement worker &apos;s rights and working conditions , calling for the strengthening of the core labour standards which are embedded in the eight ILO conventions that focus on the freedom of association and collective bargaining , the elimination of forced and compulsory labour , the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation and the abolition of child labour .
It is striking that no mention whatever is made of the need to renegotiate agreements in the agricultural sector .
In 1996 , they had dropped to barely 51 days .
The Chairman of the Socialist Group has made the point that perhaps we should use the secret ballot system .
In this respect , the Presidency believes that more progress must be made on active policies relating to labour markets , focussing on groups which have difficulties accessing the labour market , and also reducing the fiscal burdens relating to employment .
I also think that his staff &apos;s reference to the framework agreement with Parliament is not very helpful as a means of creating confidence on the part of the rapporteur and as a means of ensuring that we work together constructively on this .
It was certainly with practicalities in mind , faced with the basic requirement of 30 Members , that I submitted my amendment - I think it was my amendment , Mr Corbett - which enabled the President of Parliament , with the agreement of the Conference of Presidents , to allow a group to continue its work for a limited period if it fell below that particular threshold .
According to research conducted by the Committee on Budgetary Control , 43 % of financial transactions were incorrect .
I cried in 1954 when Hungary lost the World Cup .
We have to strike a balance between efficiency , democracy and Member State equality .
Amongst other things , many farmers have been encouraged to switch to organic farming , and that is no bad thing after all .
Can we not take this opportunity – it would appear not – to come together and think solely of the Cuban people , of their present and their future , rather than make the issue an excessively ideological one and exploit it for party political purposes ?
In my opinion , these include Galileo , which is now to be financed .
For the enormous majority of the 380 million Europeans of the Union , of all backgrounds , national , ethnic , religious or political , you embody peace and tolerance between nations and religions , as well as the wise ideals of Buddhism , of which you are the highest spiritual authority .
Madam President , I have asked the Commissioner if the EU mission in Luanda would send out a signal to prevent a new war in that country .
Moreover , the European Parliament resolution discusses at length the technical measures to improve the transparency of the ECB .
A broad international coalition must be built and must include Arab countries if we are to convince world opinion that we are not seeking a clash of civilisations .
Furthermore the economic and political stabilization of central and eastern Europe will have a positive impact on the economy of the European Union .
It is essential that appropriate measures are introduced in order to regain consumer confidence and encourage consumption .
The main priority is to give shape to the future of the enlarged Union .
In any case , our group specifically tabled an amendment to relieve the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights of its responsibility for the legal protection of consumers .
I imagine that al @-@ Qaeda and other terrorists will almost die laughing when they find out that the fire service and the police are responsible for preventing the threat of terrorism .
We must be on our guard .
Opening of the sitting
The Convention is binding on all the Member States and performs its function well .
Only yesterday , the Palestinian people commemorated the 58th anniversary of the Palestinian Nakba in 1948 , which represented the historical injustice when we , the Palestinian people , were uprooted from our land , forced into a Diaspora ; when many of us were displaced and forced to become refugees .
I feel that if we are to have an impact on these financial markets , Europe must be able to draw some very clear lines , not change direction every other day , and not bubble with hosts of ideas which are never , subsequently , put into practice .
For example , there is no right to legal representation , prison conditions are , in some cases , disgraceful and very often the investigations take an extremely long time .
Part III , at least , is going to be subject to a technical revision : such technicalities as how to vote in the Council , the technique of voting by QMV or unanimity .
That is Amendment No 43 .
This means that the more we push forward rural development and the more importance we attach to payment for environmental services and similar , the more likely it is that cofinancing will become automatic , but in a form that does not allow cohesion to fall by the wayside .
The tobacco reform was made in 2004 and was supported by all countries , including tobacco @-@ producing Member States .
rapporteur . - Mr President , I should like to thank my colleagues , and Commissioner Dimas , very much for their comments .
This must continue to be our position in the debates that are to take place in Vilnius .
The vote will take place on Thursday , 10 February 2010 .
In other words , a social climate is developing - and it made its appearance in a wing of our House this morning - which suggests that the protection of human dignity , respect for those who are different , democratic values and social solidarity have not yet been fully mastered .
One of the dysfunctions that I must emphasise particularly is institutional digression , which has primarily been at the expense of Community procedures , along with the Commission .
A system that addresses CO2 alone will not yield the maximum effect .
I would like to assure you , Mr Busuttil , that the Commission is fully committed to finding solutions to help these Member States that are experiencing particularly intense immigration pressures .
While a clear picture has yet to emerge , it certainly has all the trappings of a coordinated terrorist attack .
The &apos; Customs 2013 &apos; Programme also represents an important tool in that respect .
I am perturbed that absolutely no space is given to divergent scientific opinions .
We state repeatedly in the reports that we need more public investment - although we do not say where we are to find the money - and more private investment .
Since these people are dotted around various companies with different interests , which are continually concerned about their chances of winning or losing the next tender , workers get the feeling that their work is no longer as vital as before , and this will inevitably lead to a drop in its quality .
Each is important in itself , but together they form the recipe for long @-@ term success .
These are also some of the issues that we have to tackle .
I have run out of time .
That is the final element of this institutional agreement and it confirms the fact that both the Council and the Commission recognise that Parliament has taken useful initiatives which , as Mr Christodoulou rightly said , bring Europe closer to its citizens .
Ladies and gentlemen , permit me to conclude with the following : The summit will place particular emphasis on the endeavours of both sides to ensure the stable and democratic development of countries in the common neighbourhood area .
However , what is being presented to us as a realistic compromise with the Council is actually a third @-@ rate agreement . The approved report limits the average CO2 emissions of new light commercial vehicles to 175 g / km , while the long @-@ term objective is 147 g / km , which will not be achieved until at least 2020 .
We should also like to make a general remark on rapporteurs and their possible vested interests in the topics of their reports .
With this in mind , we note with interest and satisfaction that Togo , the host country of the Lomé Convention , is now combining a growth rate of 6 % per year with a positive and rapid development of its democratic institutions .
Once again the central role of culture in European integration and in the worldwide image of the European Union is being highlighted .
Much remains to be done and the EU will have to play its role , over and above observing the elections , by providing long @-@ term support for a reform process .
Some people in Britain were worried some years ago by the level of immigration from the Indian sub @-@ continent .
Today , we can say that the way we adapt our Community cohesion policy with a view to enlargement will determine the quality of the Union &apos; s future development .
It is important , however , that the required harmonisation provides a high level of consumer protection and is carried out with caution .
I am pleased .
The Council has not , however , taken into account Parliament &apos;s proposal on reducing the time @-@ limit within which authorities must respond from one month to two weeks .
The threshold of EUR 3 billion demanded by the Council strikes me as too high .
The Commission does not propose to attack the causes , nor is it thinking of proposing any alternatives .
Furthermore , I would like to point out that it is the Member States that are responsible for extending the inspections carried out under their veterinary systems and for relevant research .
I think it is a pity that the majority of Members are using this opportunity to make Parliament less democratic rather than taking substantial steps to make it more democratic .
Therefore , just to follow on from what Mr Schulz said , I should like to propose that we rename the Winston Churchill building , since in his 12 volumes of memoirs dedicated to the history of the Second World War , Winston Churchill wrote not one line on the history of the gas chambers .
( Parliament agreed to Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten &apos;s proposal )
This does not only apply to irregular , false and aggressive advertisements , but also to advertisements in general , as we live in a new world where people are faced with the overwhelming pressure to fit in with the consumer society already at an early age .
Mandatory biometric risk cover will cost each citizen , at a conservative estimate , around 1 @-@ 3 % of annual returns per year .
– Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the international protest against the anti @-@ terrorist , or dividing , wall is starting to bear fruit .
There are 2 500 houses for widows along with seven hospitals , and many facilities have been built , but what has happened to the rest of the money , some USD 400 million ?
In this regard , the EU and the US should take the leading role in the implementation of G20 commitments .
I come from a country where the crime of honour continued to exist even after the war , a country which only recognised rape as a crime against the individual in the seventies , when the feminist movement was in its heyday .
There are two specific questions that I would like to answer initially and then perhaps I will focus on the Treaty of Lisbon .
Paragraph 8 ( 4 ) of the bill refers to health care and social institutions and states that there are two instances in which individuals belonging to a minority group may use their mother tongue in these institutions : if they do not know the national language , or if the institution is located in a settlement where the percentage of minorities exceeds 20 % .
We were therefore initially unable to support the proposal as presented in committee .
That is why a process is now established under our Presidency to seek to find a way forward .
&lt; empty &gt;
If you read Article 49 of the treaty , and that is what we have to base our policies on , it does not make any exceptions for big countries , it does not make any exceptions for complicated cases , and it has no religious criteria .
Let me , by the way , remind you of the fact that we also have a scientific agreement with Chile .
If it goes ahead , it will be a black Friday to follow what has begun to be dubbed &apos; Bloody Sunday &apos; , 19 December , when 700 democratic protestors were arrested , including seven of the nine presidential candidates in the elections , one of whom has had both his legs broken and another beaten by riot police until he sustained brain damage .
But no !
I agree with you that we need to be more active on the ground to do more and I absolutely agree that we need to revisit the neighbourhood policy .
He also said that Russia could play an important role in the creation of a common European energy policy .
Mr President , Commissioner Patten , I think that the infrastructure in this area in particular represents a very important opportunity for the future .
The problem is that the European Parliament delegation in the Conciliation Committee was split down the middle : seven in favour and seven against .
We are sorry that priorities took them elsewhere .
The options were discussed with the result that it is unlikely that any of them - apart from option 3 , i.e. that concerning a and c quotas - can be considered due to the uncertainty regarding compatibility with the WTO rules .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Parliament does not really have anything to say on this matter .
What will be done about the investments made by Member States which have borne costs associated with the purchase of equipment to service the new system ?
There is also the issue of Haiti .
The Commission and Parliament would be better advised to explore ways by which Turkey can be associated with the EU rather than directly integrated into it .
I would also ask the German Presidency of the Council to process this dossier as soon as possible and with vigour .
This demand must be actively realised through concrete targets , in the shape , for example , of quotas .
For these reasons , the stand taken by the Council , which not only has failed to commit to a specific amount in financing for developing countries , but also has failed to say anything about financing to maintain the world &apos;s forests , is unacceptable at a time when there is no uniform policy or coordination at European Union level on the protection of forest eco @-@ systems at risk in southern Europe .
Madam President , the laying down of a sustainable common fisheries policy will do nothing to make our tasks in this area less daunting .
We are in a situation where a large number of intermediaries in the automotive sector , especially the small and medium @-@ sized enterprises in the sector , which are more vulnerable , could disappear from the European market , thereby undermining the whole European automotive market .
Europe will fail to regain or retain the affections of the citizens of the Union - and that includes the people in Scotland and our counterparts in many similar lands such as Catalonia , Flanders , Wales , Galicia , the Basque country - unless the regional and local governments with whom people there finally identify are fully respected partners in the governance of Europe .
Of course , the text is not particularly explicit in this regard , and the basic intentions are wrapped up in general considerations , some of which are pertinent , particularly on the lack of equality between men and women in employment .
I can be brief as regards the Schmid report : I wholeheartedly endorse it .
I have one oral amendment to amendment 59 .
It is an area of particular concern to me personally and to the Irish presidency because we value the social solidarity that is the central feature of the European project in Ireland .
Clearly , after each tragedy the same thing has happened : some months after , the public &apos;s attention moves on to other issues and the promised changes remain just that , mere promises .
In the proposals we made to Iran in August , the European side specifically offered support ‘ for the development of a safe , economically viable and proliferation @-@ proof civil nuclear power generation and research programme ’ .
When the new agencies , the second generation , were set , up the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control were very wary of the potential overlap between what the various agencies were to do .
The European Food Safety Authority provided a very conclusive expert report ; we do not require any further expert reports .
Since the world &apos;s agricultural land is already being fully used , increased yields can only be achieved by means of better plant material and more efficient management of natural resources .
If , in order to find that information , the majority of parliamentarians have to resort to leaks on NGO websites , then really we are a very long way from exercising parliamentary scrutiny .
Perhaps , politically , it helps those who we say want an economic Europe ; however , it does not help the political Europe which interests the European Parliament .
With six million passengers a year , Newcastle comes above the threshold , yet it is a minnow compared to the giants of Heathrow and Gatwick .
The presentation of the results was followed by an extended debate between all the European institutions .
I think it is also worth stating that I and others want to see a lot more synergy in FP7 – and , indeed , FP8 – between structural funds and research funding .
The Commission &apos; s current stance against child pornography and racism are good examples of this .
We have already provided more than EUR 40 million to the development of Kaliningrad and an additional EUR 25 million is planned for the coming years .
There is no doubt that , in the end , it will be able to join , but the road to accession involves major reforms that the Romanian government must pursue or has even yet to start . The European Union should lend it its full support .
The parliamentary assembly is a very special institution : it is the democratic arm of ACP @-@ EU cooperation and provides a voice for the people in the 93 countries which are represented there .
Like last time , we again need the Commission to be understanding towards Parliament and demanding towards the Council .
We must now send out a clear signal in terms of accountability to those who hold in their hands the future of this key treaty for the Union , for our institutions and for the 500 million Europeans that we represent .
No woman , no child in any country is immune from this violence . This violence is both physical and mental , both private and public and it costs the lives of 1.5 million people each year .
The current voluntary principle is not working .
This is why , in February 2002 , the Commission produced an action plan for skills and mobility that identifies 25 measures intended to respond to the shortcomings and needs indicated by the high @-@ level task force .
We must promote clean technologies in coal .
I believe that we have made the identification requirements which were laid down more practical .
Mr Albertini now has the floor to speak for the two minutes he has remaining as rapporteur .
We also need to place movement restrictions on those who have finished custodial sentences .
– Mr President , Commissioner , while we are debating the framework of the responsibilities and the funding of the European Maritime Safety Agency to prevent and combat cases of maritime pollution , a huge ecological disaster is unfolding in the southeast Mediterranean as a result of the criminal bombing of the Jiyyeh power plant in Lebanon by the Israelis .
This is the most crucial decision contained in this report , and represents a compromise between the Commission , the Council and Parliament .
I know that in the past the Commission has taken action on products that have come from East Jerusalem , the Golan Heights , the West Bank and the Gaza Strip .
As we know , most of Aceh &apos;s 4.2 million people live outside the two main towns .
Third , Ms Svensson &apos;s attempt is attentive to these principles and tries to improve market forces with artificial legislating steps , which will harm and distort natural market forces stemming from the supply and demand relationship .
By the time she takes it we will have missed the train .
This requires , Mr President , and I will end here , a change in culture , in mentality and habits .
This report on the proposed guidelines for Member States &apos; employment policies for 1999 contains a series of recommendations relating to Member States &apos; action plans .
There is no proposal for a European plan , no prospects for the automotive industry , and no will to coordinate national policies .
We need two different action programmes , because a very large number of very different questions are discussed and dealt with here .
However , the right to make a complaint , as well as the right to submit a petition , is an opportunity , a practical test , a continuous sounding instrument in some way of the operation of the European Union : direct , with the citizen , with the active participation of the citizen .
What I cannot accept , however , is the fact that more than a year after the accession of ten new Member States , there is still at least one parliamentary committee in which no interpretation for certain new Member State languages is provided , and that colleagues from these states are unable to take part in the deliberations of these committees using their official mother tongue .
The position we have reached here today owes much to her personal commitment , tenacity and determination .
You spoke about an international recession , international crisis .
I also agree that these relations need a fresh impetus , and one way in which this can be done would be to update the new agenda .
Sadly , just a few days later , I found myself sending another set of messages , this time to the governments of Guatemala , Honduras , El Salvador and Nicaragua . Once again , I expressed Parliament &apos;s deep regret and the sadness felt by all its Members .
This is an exceptional decision in response to exceptional circumstances .
I thank the Commissioner for the support she gave us in the delegation that attended the summit in New York .
The personal , moral and ethical views of each of us must not conflict with this approach , especially as each Member State will be responsible for deciding which type of products it will allow to be imported and which not .
Finally , these schemes aim to encourage and support the development of sustainable mechanisms and practices which will ensure that women researchers have an equal opportunity to compete on the basis of their scientific expertise , knowledge and potential .
Secondly , consumers will experience falling prices for spare car parts because there will be more competition between manufacturers .
This Parliament must fully assume its new powers in these matters .
Governments must not tax SMEs out of existence .
We also need to consider the importance of pipelines in future .
This requires studying the social impact of new Community strategies , to prevent an increase in discrimination and inequality , to ensure equality in social progress and not in the decline of economic , social and employment rights , and to protect the social purpose of motherhood and fatherhood .
This is a thing of the past , as the Council budget has changed fundamentally .
- ( NL ) We have consented to the Haarder report but would like to make the following observations regarding paragraphs 19 and 20 of the draft report .
Mr President , I appeal to the mighty of this world : Do what is right !
I think this report represents a firm and precise starting point for the future of transport .
That is why we are also actively engaged - via our cooperation with our African partners - in looking collectively at this issue .
Thank you very much , Madam Commissioner .
This can lead to complications during decommissioning activities and can also result in additional financial problems .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( EL ) Mr President , we , the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece , will not vote for the enlargement of the EU to take in FYROM and Croatia .
The motor oil , car and recycling industries have made a lot of things possible where road use by individuals is concerned .
The task of the agency will not be to monitor Member States but to provide them and the Union &apos;s institutions with information and expertise .
I must draw your attention to the fact that some Member States , including the Czech Republic , have been late in transposing the directives into their national legislation .
Finally , by happy chance , a letter from Mr Georgievski , President of Macedonia to Mr Fischler , dated 8 March , has come into my hands . In it , referring to Article O , now Article 49 of the Treaty , he asks if Macedonia can join the European Union .
The report points out that the following aspects of the system should be clarified or modified : observance of the basic principle of non @-@ refoulement ; applicants must receive all relevant information concerning the Dublin system in a language which they understand and they must have access to legal aid throughout the procedure , they must also have the right to a suspensory appeal against any transfer decision ; the criteria for determining the age of minors should be harmonised ; mechanisms should be devised for blocking transfers to countries which plainly do not uphold applicants &apos; rights .
On occasions such as these , however , many of us have also realised that there are forces in Parliament that are able to exploit even tragedies for their own ends , for the death in Genoa was a tragedy . This was simply to achieve their political objectives : that is , to discredit the centre @-@ right government in Italy .
I would like to remind you that , from South to North , forests of all kinds cover a third of European Union territory .
Mr President , the European Union already has a quarter of a century of legislative tradition which obliges it to take equality between women and men in working life seriously .
We have to have a better focus on young people , which is clearly a key consideration for Europe 2020 .
The calls to support cultural and creative industries through better qualification , education and training systems , in particular by seeking to provide students at all levels of education in cultural and artistic disciplines with professional training , reflect this situation .
The United States and Europe will continue to be closely involved with each other .
One is the idea that there is a European identity , the result of which might well be common and effective European policies .
These are inalienable values of the project of European integration , and they represent an opportunity for the Turkish people and the peaceful enhancement of their ethnic and cultural diversity .
Particularly where jobs are concerned , we are faced with a situation which is deteriorating fast in every Member State .
We would have preferred it if the European Parliament had sent a clear message of support to the mediator of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , who has worked hard for a year to try to find the most amicable solution possible .
I would remind the House that , prior to the Council meeting , a compromise was reached on three of the six reports in the energy and climate package .
We are fully aware that all countries are not equal as regards administrative controls and techniques for the import , storage and processing of such waste .
The acquis is definitely very important ; it is the base and our foundation .
Famine has before now been the cause of revolutions , unrest and uncontrollable floods of refugees .
I welcome the Commission &apos;s initiative to remove the visa system for citizens from the Western Balkans region , more specifically the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Serbia and Montenegro .
( FR ) Mr President , tropical timber tonight , the financial crisis this week , major pandemics , migration , the food crisis ... it all leads us to the same conclusion : the major political issues of today are global and require a global political response .
You are , of course , facing the last and challenging rounds of the negotiation and we warmly encourage you to step up your preparation efforts .
This point of view is based both on democratic reasons and on the fact that national circumstances in this area vary greatly .
As you know , in February 2008 the Commission presented a communication entitled &apos; A common European approach to Sovereign Wealth Funds &apos; .
Many of them believe that there should be a complete ban .
This is her last report in her last Parliament .
As the High Representative , Mr Solana , said , in attempting to eliminate the infrastructures of terrorism Ariel Sharon is likely ultimately to produce fresh armies of fanatical terrorists , but we must not for one moment think that , unlike those who destroyed the Twin Towers , the Palestinian suicide bombers are not backed by an authority which is just as bloodthirsty and cynical .
I would also caution against staking too much on gas : we have just heard a great deal about the dependency that entails .
We should never forget , however , where ultimate responsibility for this crisis lies .
We are in real danger of repeating the mistakes made in Cancun .
The small person gets no hearing against the state , and I would like the Commission to take this back : that there are some complaints which I , as a Member , have not ...
It is on communications .
The problems of relocation are phenomena which , as such , were initially seen as a positive influence on the market by the Community &apos;s instruments , for example as positive subsidization of disadvantaged areas by the Structural Funds .
( DE ) Mr President , I would like to thank the staff of this House for organising the awards ceremony for the Energy Globe Awards , because it set a great example for the world and created an excellent impression of our Parliament .
It is not easy but it is more than needed .
We have also increased the milk quota by 2 % .
My Group welcomes the methodical approach of your presidency to preparations for the Union &apos;s budget from 2007 to 2013 , but we are not sure whether your building blocks are independent building blocks or a Rubik &apos;s Cube .
However , the most crucial ingredient in tackling this fraud is political will .
In order that this proposal should not remain merely a political project , we must be acutely aware of the views of all interested parties .
Of course , I also voted in favour of it .
There the connection is much more complex , because in certain cases the difficulty of re @-@ entering the labour market is more connected with the specific characteristics of the welfare state and social security systems that benefit our own citizens .
It is to my satisfaction that Mr Schwab prepared such an excellent report .
The atmosphere during the election campaign is dangerous .
I would like an assurance that the Commission will give top priority to social measures , and indeed fiscal ones , rather than to social dumping as has been the case up to now .
Here , the majority of this House has offered the prescription which it has been advocating for many years :
In this connection , Mr President , I want to stress the justified concern expressed in this House yesterday by a representative delegation of associations of democratic movements and human rights associations about the real risks that political activists , human rights activists and journalists are running today .
It grows fastest in some areas like municipal waste , and that is why we need to take action .
That is not the case .
The services sector is of fundamental and vital importance for the Ukrainian economy .
This legal basis is Article 171 of the Treaty , as Mr Fernandez has just said , and this has been confirmed by Parliament &apos;s Committee on Legal Affairs and by the Commission .
That competition is inconceivably ruthless .
Accordingly , economic sanctions , such as those directed against the Netherlands as President of the EU in 1997 because it drafted a UN resolution about the human rights situation in China , are now a thing of the past .
Many people here have spoken about this and it could be a subject for my meeting with the Conference of Presidents at lunch , as it is of course up to Parliament in particular , and naturally also the Presidency and the European affairs ministers , to now get this public debate under way and garner popular support for the project .
I am glad to be able to state that since the beginning of last year there has been clear progress .
It is a kind of export subsidy , and I would like it if , when voting on this agreement , we had an assurance that this clause will not set a precedent and will not be included in any other future agreements .
This is not by definition an issue for the nation states .
We should not allow ourselves the luxury of superficial diagnosis , since that could lead to mistaken policies .
It is our job as the European Parliament to make sure that the public is protected , but also that our companies remain competitive in this global competitive struggle .
I fully agree with the proposal of the rapporteur that more transparency is needed , and I fully share his suggestion to add MEPs to the governing board of the agency .
I also note Parliament &apos;s wish to include in the action plan activities which cannot be covered by the directive , in particular , regarding criteria for allocating organs , recording the wishes of potential donors and issues relating to medical practices .
The tools ?
The result is a balanced and constructive motion for a resolution , which should enhance the quality of the debate between the institutions and make this decision easier to take .
In terms of the crisis itself , it is clear that , for us , the crisis did not start with finance .
I am quite happy for the Central Bank to play a leading role in any areas to do with exchange , but even so I would like to draw your attention to the provisions of the Treaty that assign shared powers to the Bank and governments for exchange policy .
The PNR communication highlights these principles and lays down efficient and effective measures to safeguard the interest of data subjects .
I also want to express my thanks for the work that has been done in this important area .
The UN runs an index of happiness and it places the Democratic Republic of the Congo above only Zimbabwe .
We all want to show solidarity and to express our deepest sympathies , above all to the families and friends of the victims .
That is something that struck me , because there is actually a feeling of embarrassment in our institutions , and in that sense we are playing the game of the fundamentalists , who tend to identify the presence of Christians in the Middle East and other parts of the world precisely with the West and Europe .
That is why I am calling on Parliament to accept Amendment 12 , which facilitates this flexibility .
For this reason we should definitely not agree to any cuts in this modest instrument and we must also see that it is not used to fund projects for which it is not in fact appropriate .
That is a fact !
However , unlike Colombia , Sri Lanka &apos;s general approach was to deny the existence of any problems and not to cooperate with the Commission at any stage of the investigation .
Sunday rest is not just an essential , quantifiable factor in the lives of a high percentage of our population , but also an important element of our working and family lives .
We have to avoid any changes to the final text of the resolution that would complicate the situation or endanger the lives of these defenceless people .
The law is made by people for people , and if it is imperfect , let us take action to change it , but let us not exploit human misery for political ends .
The spirit of Amendment No 10 and part of Amendments Nos 25 , 46 and 69 stress the importance of the reconciliation of family and working life and call for complementary action on paternity leave .
Therefore she deserves all our respect , and I support the report .
Since we know for certain that human rights in Burma are being continuously violated , the EU must support the democratic forces in that country and demand the release of all political prisoners .
For my own part , I still believe that it would be ill @-@ advised to cover cars and motorcycles with the same licence , because they require two very different sets of driving skills , even though it might be a means of improving mutual understanding between motorists and motorcyclists .
It concludes that the proposal will be to the advantage of all the least developed countries .
I am pleased that the heated controversy over Kaliningrad was resolved at the summit .
There is no reason to regulate public transport in the EU Treaty .
In supporting the objectives of the enlargement , my political group will be equally vigilant and seriously committed to achieving all this in a spirit of harmony and prosperity for all .
That is why I would urge more help for countries outside the European Union to stop this disease coming in .
In other words , the EU can do a lot more with the same money .
I would like , here , to suggest the use of all means , including , mainly civilian operations , as part of efforts to modernise a country which is , today , in ruins after 30 years of permanent war .
The European Union must therefore continue to concern itself with combating these problems .
Moreover , at the same time as you are trying to encourage Member States of the Union to increase development aid , within the international bodies - we could quote the WTO as an example here - policies are being pursued which in some cases are preventing these objectives from being achieved .
This has been done in some countries already and it is important that we all look at the possibility of doing it .
Mr President , I have to admit that I have found it very difficult to take a firm position in an argument which is still very obscure and difficult to assess .
in writing . - ( DE ) Discharge has been granted .
Here , in my opinion , mistakes have been made in the past .
And I would say to Mr Watson , with the greatest of respect , that it would also be interesting - he has a golden opportunity - if he could explain why he feels surrounded by Germans .
In fact , it is something that the Commission has been looking closely into , since such a theory could facilitate the use in some Member States of the unused quota in other Member States .
She has been congratulated throughout the speeches but we must recognise the hard work she and Mr Viola have done .
We do not think that any compromise solutions will bring the results that either Turkey or the Union is hoping for .
As you rightly say , the problem is that the report does not indicate the legal basis - and we need that to take the vote with the right majority to make it effective - and nor does it contain a financial statement .
The problem is that EMU has no automatic stabilizers .
Mr Lukashenko &apos;s regime does not perhaps meet the criteria of our democracies which are themselves , moreover , far from being perfect and , even , increasingly devoid of any content as national sovereignty is progressively relinquished .
The rights of people with reduced mobility must come before the private interests of bus manufacturers .
For that reason , he thought it more appropriate to propose the gradual introduction of a series of measures to encourage the fishermen themselves to alter their fishing methods and equipment , an approach strongly approved of by the Commission .
This emerges from many sentences and passages in the White Paper , and we must reject this .
We focus on concrete measures , not a general definition of innovation .
As our rapporteur , Mr Fava , told our American colleagues , it reflected great credit on Congress that they were the first parliamentary body to ask Parliament &apos;s committee to share and discuss its findings .
Under no circumstances will a single vote of ours support this amendment .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , you will be aware that we have been highly vocal in our criticism of certain Commissioners , but I should like to tell Mr Barroso in person that we too find the way in which he has been attacked unacceptable .
How does the Commission plan to reconcile all these aspects of the problem ?
It is alarming to see the sharp rise in demand for synthetic drugs , particularly Ecstasy , and the careless attitude that people take to these pep @-@ pills , with no thought of the dangers involved .
I therefore welcome the European Commission &apos;s proposal to allocate EUR 1.5 billion to interconnection projects .
That is perfectly obvious .
At a time when this regime is increasingly coming under attack at the WTO , it is essential that the European Commission defends it .
Sarajevo has a special place in European history and culture .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen :
Thanks to their combined efforts , the economies of the EU and South Korea will be billions of euros better off .
The Arab peoples are watching us .
You cannot ask the Commission to do anything other than comply with the Regulations ourselves and ensure that they are complied with by others .
A study will be launched this year on the development of an EU harmonised responsibility and cost @-@ sharing scheme to be considered in the context of a review of the currently available financial instruments .
This is the spirit of the communication on an action programme relating to legal immigration , which the College is to debate next week .
The first one concerns resettlement policy and the second protection in the region - the possibility of asking for asylum outside the territory of the European Union .
There is also the Special Peace Programme from the European Union itself .
We object to the possibility of precedence being given to freight transport at the expense of passenger trains , however .
This Protocol is significant for the EU , however , from the budgetary viewpoint alone .
I am here to make sure that the speaking times , which have been very rigorously scheduled , are adhered to .
Just quieten down please .
There is support for this one , too .
It is known that biodiversity loss is mostly related to irresponsible human economic activity .
He set out the Commission &apos;s strategic objectives , with growth and employment naturally being at the top of the list of priorities .
Madam President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , the Dutch have sometimes been criticized in recent weeks for a lack of ambition in planning their presidency .
The Commission , therefore , does not see the need to establish an extra taskforce .
Furthermore , as I mentioned , it has become clear that there is still a need for closer cooperation between terrorism and air security experts .
So , I have no doubt that structural funds can help deliver the 2020 goals .
It is therefore economic liberalisation which is the most important ally of discrimination , the combating of which needs to be placed at the centre of our political practice .
Torture and illegal detention by government forces under the leadership of the Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov remain widespread and systematic .
I will follow the due procedure .
Of course , the reports are very substantial and I will , therefore , focus on only some elements .
Mr President , as everyone here is aware , biotechnology has developed rapidly in many areas .
This has to be taken into account when the discussions and dialogue are initiated , otherwise they will be going against this Union &apos;s policies and principles on human rights and democracy .
The Spanish and the French have one view on how this should be handled , the British , Irish and the Nordic countries another view .
All Member States are offering what is being called a broad &quot; euro 1999 option &apos; for companies , and many of them are also offering it for individuals .
Thank you , Mr Santer .
We have two choices .
In the outlined policy , there will be no need for the destruction of large batches since , without international transport , the risk of infection is much smaller .
It has to be reformed .
So far as I know , it was taken by the Council primarily in the light of the amount of time the Member States said they needed for ratification .
The powers of the national parliaments must increase with regard to proposals , current business and control .
Mr President , before I start I should like to welcome the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Minister Fitzgerald , to the House .
Its faithful are perfectly aware that , once it is launched , democratisation will inevitably and very quickly put an end to their stranglehold .
Approval of Minutes of previous sitting : see Minutes
You know very well , colleagues , that , with the Lisbon Treaty , the common external policy acquires much more depth and much more momentum .
( FR ) Mr President , Minister , Commissioner , the long and lively debates we have had on the European Globalisation Fund ring in my ears to this day .
I would also like a clear statement as to why ratification of the Treaty has been made contingent on the ratification of bilateral agreements with the United States over the radar issue and on a law dealing with the relationship between the two chambers of the Czech Parliament .
Madam President , I have no questions but I would like to sum up by saying thank you .
&lt; empty &gt;
This directive is intended to allow all patients - and not only the best informed or richest - to enjoy a series of healthcare rights which have already been recognised by the Court of Justice of the European Union .
All the information we have indicates that it is five minutes to midnight !
Despite the improvement of energy efficiency , it is forecast that if present trends are maintained , the consumption of mineral resources will increase in order to satisfy our energy demands .
We need to clarify our commitment in financial terms and in terms of aid granted to developing countries , in particular , through technology transfer .
Ensuring regular , reliable supplies of ample Turkmen hydrocarbon resources will diminish Europe &apos;s current overdependence on Russia .
We have a heavy agenda , and I am not continuing something which was closed yesterday by the President in the Chair .
This deadline is , of course , well past and our main priority , therefore , is to create this post as soon as we possibly can .
You are already aware that there has been a technical adjustment to the maximum limits of Headings 3 , 4 and 5 , which in themselves create an almost insoluble problem in terms of achieving the figures for the 2004 budget .
We launched the debate on 24 January 2007 and since then we have received lots of very valuable input , not least from the European Parliament and the report of Mrs Salinas García .
Above all , he must be able to express his opinions freely .
The planned principle of one @-@ stop shops is not working in many countries or is not working appropriately , and entrepreneurs sometimes still have to obtain endless licences which must be checked by a whole host of inspection bodies .
With regard to immigration , for example , the &apos; every man for himself &apos; principle was no longer in fashion .
I am also of the belief that the technology platforms will be of enormous benefit to European industry .
On this subject , it must be said that the instruments of the first pillar frequently provide for sanctions , but these do not necessarily need to be in the form of criminal law .
You were the first parliamentary speaker of the sitting , so we shall just treat this as an act of kindness on the part of the presidency .
We can only watch as the number of check points increases rather than decreases .
This is why I am asking the House to agree that in this exceptional case , we should remove this urgent matter from the agenda , because this will be of greater help in resolving the case than debating it would be .
I voted for this report as , in the proposal for codifying the Third Council Directive 78 / 855 / EEC of 9 October 1978 concerning mergers of public limited liability companies , the Commission has taken into consideration the editorial or formal amendments proposed by the Consultative Working Party of the legal services , which have proved to be justified .
Alternatively , why not consider the Prodi proposals for mobilisation of the resources or reserves of the central banks once the euro has come into being ?
The German company E.ON has been granted access to Siberian reserves and the energy market , and both countries will jointly build a gas pipeline , an umbilical cord , under the Baltic Sea .
The steps needed to ensure safe food have much in common with the steps needed for a more efficient fight against climate change , improved development aid , the development of other commercial structures , greater transparency on the commodity markets and measures against speculation .
Thank you , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office .
The pathological hunt to locate the contamination site led to premature accusations of guilt all round , and these arguments led to days of negative headlines and total uncertainty on the part of consumers .
This is a requirement and a duty that we must fulfil on behalf of all European citizens , who are often unaware that they are buying a falsified medicine .
The other countries are therefore doing somewhat worse .
Moreover , why are the proposals that did not see the light of day in 1998 not then included in the 1999 programme ?
Brittany and Galicia , two European &apos; Lands Ends &apos; , fall constant prey to the irresponsibility of those who prefer not to comply with safety regulations and transport crude oil in vessels which in themselves constitute potential oil slicks .
At the same time , however , we have to ensure that the trans @-@ European transport networks also extend to more sparsely populated and remote regions .
Given the developments in the road transport sector as a result of new European emission standards for fuels , I am of the opinion that in order to boost the environmental performance of short sea shipping , we need to lay down a European directive concerning maximum permitted emission levels generated by ships &apos; engines .
The specific solutions that we are proposing have been worked out in very close cooperation with the beekeeping sector .
Mr President , like Mrs Figueiredo , we also welcome this action plan against social exclusion .
In the context of the current events in the Southern Mediterranean , redeveloping this policy could not be more important .
In addition , it would have a positive impact on the environment , since we now know that set aside is often harmful to the environment .
So difficulties are bound to occur .
It is a multi @-@ faceted ideological assault by large multinational corporations and , as has already been said , the first step in the formation of a global government of multinationals .
- ( LT ) Ten years is long enough to be able to assess the benefits - or lack thereof - of the Economic and Monetary Union .
I congratulate my fellow Members Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo on their fruitful and creative contribution .
The Council , the Commission and Parliament , acting together , can help to bring about a change in the situation in Baghdad .
I agree with Mr van den Bos : an independent body needs to be set up to investigate the arrests , ill @-@ treatment and killings .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we can all remember the pictures of the famine in Ethiopia in the 1980s . We can also remember the drought in Africa in the 1990s , which affected around ten countries .
( The President cut the speaker off )
What was really needed was to achieve a reasonable and fair balance between on the one hand , the necessary transparency and , on the other , the essential caution required by the highly secretive nature of this type of information .
I know and deeply respect the fact that many would like a separate rule , but it should not be a rule just for the sake of a headline .
We should be compassionate in the role that we seek to play .
Even yesterday , I found myself considerably irritated when I listened to Russian and Ukrainian counterparts declaring here that they were certainly not at fault .
The text of the resolution reinforces the idea of an EU policy of double standards in relation to human rights , especially on the issue of human rights violations in the occupied Palestinian territories .
I hope that the British Government gives the necessary clarification in this case .
The vast majority of these principles are covered by horizontal legislation , particularly in the directives on hygiene and control .
The United States and the European Union reacted to this difficult situation by making even greater mediation efforts , during which the EU special envoy in the Middle East , Miguel Moratinos , repeatedly put proposals to the conflicting parties on ways of bridging their differences .
We should do everything possible to get the problem under control , including the use of this method .
I would ask all honourable Members , if they can - and I believe this is possible - to summarise their questions in no longer than one minute .
Could I add that I hope that the discussions we are having here will somehow serve as a lesson to us in the next step towards enlargement by the accession of more countries ?
This development is the direct consequence of the procedure to integrate Cyprus into the European Union , the G8 resolution and the Helsinki resolution and our party warned of their consequences a very long time ago .
I have of course also voted in favour of these points .
This is what I wanted to say .
In my opinion , a tax of 10 % , which is deducted at source , would allow the internal capital market - and I stress that it is the internal market - to function smoothly and the services sector to flourish .
Mr President , this report , which concludes that the immunity of our colleague , Mr Gollnisch , should not be upheld , disregarded all of the general principles related to privileges and immunity , as well as the settled case @-@ law of the competent committees .
We , therefore , reassert our firm rejection of any effort to limit the use of any official ( and working ) European Union language on the grounds of high costs , an example of which , as we pointed out at the appropriate time , are the current criteria that determine the languages used during the EU @-@ ACP parliamentary assemblies , which make the use of Portuguese unfeasible in a discriminatory manner .
rapporteur . - ( ES ) Madam President , I wish to begin , like the other rapporteurs , Catherine Trautmann and Malcolm Harbour , by thanking them , firstly , for the extraordinary opportunity I have had to work on this reform of the European regulation of telecommunications markets because , in my view and still limited experience in this Parliament , it has been a model of cooperation between different Members from different groups .
To my mind , it is wasteful to pay out £ 10 , 000 to remove a window in order to get a car into a building , followed by another £ 10 , 000 to get it out again .
At the request of Members of this House , the Commission has made an investigation of alternative technical solutions that would allow for , firstly , not reopening the discussions on the substance and , secondly , having clear rules adopted in time for FRONTEX operations this summer .
Several of you have said that this report does not talk about how efficiently the funds are used .
Thank you , Mr President . Ladies and gentlemen , it has been said here repeatedly that the agreement with Milosevic is not an ideal one .
Back in my country , which does not belong to the euro area , there is currently a discussion taking place along these lines : &apos; This demonstrates precisely what we said when voting against the euro in 2001 .
It is not as if agreements are reached without discussion : there are very frequent exchanges of opinion and sometimes even wrangles .
The elections , which were monitored by the United Nations ( UN ) and the European Union , took place in a generally satisfactory way .
For solar thermal collectors and systems manufactured in other countries to benefit from public solar energy subsidies in France and Spain , they must be tested for compliance with the respective national standards and verification procedures , despite their having already been certified in accordance with European standards .
What has been done in the field of external energy policy ?
They will be able to encourage European consumers through their example , as well as through providing infrastructure facilities and benefits associated with the various charges , such as for parking or pollution .
These are as follows : on culture , Amendments 11 , 21 and 22 , on education , Amendments 13 , 14 and 15 , and on youth , Amendments 15 , 22 and 23 .
According to our figures , at least 100 individuals were arbitrarily arrested and are now facing prosecution under the anti @-@ subversion law .
I would have liked to have heard him say that , due to the financial crisis , we are losing jobs .
At the same time , we need to provide adequate financial resources to ensure that decommissioning operations occur in accordance with safety regulations .
We think there should be further study , thought and information about the fact that a quarter of the allocations authorized in 1996 - ECU 94 million - and intended for redundancy payments is reserved for invalidity pensions .
The production of crops for non @-@ food purposes is not protected by the CAP , given that aid is less than EUR 80 per hectare per year , and the rapporteur calls for steps to be taken to put an end to public aid .
Lastly , Europe is not financing knowledge .
And even if they did a very great deal of money , it would still be open to doubt whether that really is a sound principle .
The Americans , who have perhaps been turning their attention to the Far East - and indeed some investors in the European Union who turned their attention to the Far East - are going to come back and rely very heavily on the stable relationship between the United States and the European Union .
Consequently , because of differing interpretations , traders and consumers find themselves faced with very different products , but sold under one and the same description : veal .
At this meeting the Council adopted a declaration on the European Union response to those terrible bombings .
Just as we did with dairy products when a deep crisis broke out in that sector , we need now , too , to call that surplus into use .
in writing . - I welcome this resolution and , in particular , the oral amendment by Stephen Hughes which &apos; calls on the Council to provide the necessary political signal for a Commission investigation into a future system of Eurobonds , with a clear specification of the conditions under which such a system would be beneficial to all participating Member States and to the eurozone as a whole &apos; .
Mr President , I would also like to congratulate Mr Blokland on this report which will set Europe @-@ wide standards for incineration , including for the first time emission standards for dioxins and furanes ; this should lead to more competition between different methods of waste disposal , and as a result help bring to an end the transport of hazardous waste across Europe in search of the cheapest waste operators .
This report proposes that Europol should have direct access to the customs information system .
I have to say that a study we carried out today of the votes that will take place showed that the modifications introduced by Richard Corbett , Ana Palacio and Vice @-@ President Gutiérrez Díaz are important and change a good many things .
We find it regrettable that this law has been signed .
I confirm what Mr Tannock has just said and , for the same reasons , we request that paragraph 5 be deleted .
So the only way to guarantee Italian fishermen an income and a future in fishing is to ban the &apos; spadare &apos; completely , carry out a conversion process , use more selective methods that are less dangerous for the environment and cement relationships with third countries to ensure control of the use of the &apos; spadare &apos; in that zone .
Reinsurance protection is thus a further quality characteristic for consumer protection in the insurance sector .
On the one hand the EU has to suggest measures enabling Member States to strengthen security and the protection of their citizens ; on the other hand the Commission has to take data protection and privacy concerns into careful consideration .
As many colleagues will be aware , the Commission is attempting to impose conditions on the Bureau which would have the effect of closing its office in Dublin .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , creating a common European asylum policy and resettlement policy means ensuring human rights and , at the same time , restricting illegal immigration .
If we fail to ensure that , it will mean that many procedures causing pain , distress or suffering would no longer be subject to a centrally monitored ethical review and that in turn would effectively undermine the enforcement of many of the measures set out in the proposal as a whole .
Now I would like to invite my colleagues and the Vice @-@ President of the Commission to join me in front of the podium for the signing of the document .
Furthermore , there are still unresolved border issues with Croatia &apos;s neighbours and we do not wish to see these imported into the EU .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( FR ) Ladies and gentlemen , Madam President , Commissioner , this is a matter of urgency , as we all know .
( HU ) Madam President , Commissioner , during the crisis , we could see for ourselves how important the role of industry is in our economy .
The general sequence of events gives no grounds for optimism .
I am the first to acknowledge that the committee has been successful on many fronts .
Let us be clear .
We also all know full well that , when Mr Ekeus , the United Nations representative , reported to the United Nations in 1997 after 6900 visits and inspections , he said that there was no reason to suspect that Iraq was harbouring nuclear or chemical weapons .
And before anyone draws parallels between the action in Libya and Côte d &apos;Ivoire and that in Iraq , I would like to remind everyone that the current action is not reminiscent of Iraq or even Afghanistan , but of Rwanda , and of Kosovo , and it is no coincidence that we have been talking so much over the past few weeks about having , as we formulated it , a &apos; right and responsibility to protect &apos; civilians , citizens .
We cannot therefore support paragraphs 30 and 31 .
In the current economic context , we could describe the country of Belgium as the Greece of the North Sea without any exaggeration whatsoever because this country , Belgium , has , after Greece and Italy , the largest government debt in percentage terms in the whole of Europe .
In this respect , the significant decrease in infant mortality and the rise in the number of children attending school are encouraging signs .
In the light of the exponential increase since 1996 of the costs of media promotion of the euro , which are becoming extremely high , how much will this promotion finally cost for Europe , for the Member States and for each citizen ?
In this context , I support the implementation of more reliable payment provisions , and the European Parliament being better informed about the level of payments underway , by programme , in order to respond to the risks of payments being cancelled .
Indeed , this is provided for in the Treaties .
That concludes voting time .
I noted with satisfaction that Mrs. Reding , together with many other speakers in this assembly , is urging Member States to ratify the Europol Convention as soon as possible .
Their company had just been taken over by a large group in France . The employees were hoping first of all to have more secure jobs now .
I should also like to draw Parliament ’ s attention to one element of the Human Rights Council : the universal periodic review .
For seven months , there was an &apos; ice age &apos; .
Is it not time to terminate our agreement with the United States ? That country is sentencing the people of Iraq to death , in the long run , and is now interfering not with a violation of international law , as in the past , but with an internal arrangement which is of no concern to the international community .
The legislation is only of value if it is also implemented in practice .
. Mr President , next year will be crucial in the face of a Europe lacking modern institutions and budgetary prospects , a Europe in crisis faced with citizens who are increasingly uncertain of it and who , unfortunately , made us aware of the fact in spring .
That was obvious during the budget debate .
The Commission must therefore reject Amendment No 4 .
I would like to ask once again : are there any instruments for positive discrimination in favour of long @-@ standing national minorities ?
Improvements can often be made by means of a better cost @-@ benefit ratio rather than by starting on an entirely new project .
In my view this is all the more reason to tax energy as fast as possible , because low prices for fossil fuels will not favour the introduction of renewable sources !
I am voting against this text out of solidarity with the Serbian people .
That will be corrected , Mr Poignant .
If only terrorists and serious criminals wore black hats and displayed sinister sneers , those two needs could be satisfied simultaneously .
The European Danube Commission was founded on 30 March 1856 in the wake of the Paris Conference , with its headquarters in Galaţi , in Romania .
Greater flexibility on the part of the applicant countries should be expected in the name of good neighbourliness .
Moldovan society is multi @-@ ethnic and multi @-@ linguistic ; moreover , essential differences exist in relation to the assessment of historical events .
I am convinced that the current Irish law that is operating in this regard is in breach of the European Union Directive of 2004 on mobility and on residency and also in breach of European Union anti @-@ discrimination laws , because this is being applied only to the spouses of non @-@ Irish EU citizens .
My oral amendment is simply intended to send a message and provide a basic methodology to be adopted for the post @-@ 2013 period for a possible additional reduction .
in writing . - ( DE ) Combating terrorism will be the challenge of this century .
Amendment No 5 is accepted while Amendment No 6 is not accepted unless in the form that I suggest , which I understand Parliament may put forward .
Furthermore , China plays an important role in the Club of Twenty , which brings together some of the great tenors of the new world stage , and because of its history , because of its weight and also because the European Union has advocated that China should be incorporated into world trade , I believe that it makes sense at this point to ask these questions , taking the view that we are all in the same situation regardless of our specific characteristics , but that we must respect each other in order to survive together .
So this is another point on which I have tabled an amendment .
I know that Mrs Gradin is looking into this very closely , as she made plain at the Stockholm conference which I also attended as well as here in Parliament .
We particularly congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Costa , whose tenacity , although exasperating at times , has achieved an agreement , a matter on which I congratulate him from the heart .
We must all face up to this fact and facilitate this process as much as possible .
My last question for Mr Rehn , and for Mr Barroso especially , is therefore : are you genuinely in favour of the common corporate tax basis ? Do you genuinely support it ?
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , today we are celebrating International Women &apos;s Day with great enthusiasm , emotion and hope .
It is certainly the case that the texts need to be cleaned up because we have adopted quite a few texts which , according to the rules of lawmaking , do not belong in this directive at all .
The basis for racism is always irrationality , and I cannot help but think that certain arguments against Turkey ’ s accession are not political , but purely cultural , or , in other words , racist .
Rejected food or feed could end up being used either in a third country or being shipped back to the EU and that would constitute a risk to food safety .
Where should the initiative for such a process ...
Employees in the EU deserve better .
The UK is to benefit from increased squid quota around South Georgia .
The survey results include the interesting information that up to 85 % of consumers are prepared to pay more for food produced in accordance with the highest welfare standards .
My second question pertains to the reconstruction of the hospital in Mitrovica .
These demands are now no longer written in this way in the agenda .
A weakened reform will lead literally to famine and destitution .
Firstly , no one wants a data overload and , secondly , staff privacy must continue to be respected , as it is usually the case that , by virtue of data protection , there is no small number of details that are not universally accessible even to other institutions , including national ones .
This will be achieved by gradually phasing out the taxes paid to date and replacing them with environmental taxes determined in an arbitrary manner .
Our action at the European level is essential if we want to achieve our economic and social objectives .
Yes , it is true to say that we welcome all the new states of the European Union – all of them .
It is for each undertaking to decide and organise its production between one or more processing plants according to its own criteria .
The risk is great ! Both in terms of moral and intellectual crime .
We have set up a platform and we are discussing with industry and stakeholders how we can each help to solve this problem .
There must always be the highest possible return on capital .
The country makes great claims for itself and has , for years , served as an example to the rest of Latin America in the areas of education , health care and other public services , as well as the protection of the most vulnerable sections of the population .
Ukraine is a multi @-@ ethnic and a multi @-@ confessional country and one with a very chequered history , which is something we have to take into account .
In the end the Serbian authorities should themselves answer the pressing question : is Serbia standing in its own way ?
In this respect I deplore the failure of the negotiations of last December on the clarification of Article 31 of the intellectual property agreements .
The Convention has been an instrument to perpetuate that European presence in those parts of the globe .
We also need to look at the implications of the current employment policy which not only encourages but actively pushes more people , especially women , into the workforce and away from the caring role they might have fulfilled or the voluntary work they might have done .
At this moment we have not yet completed our assessment .
Mr Howitt , we shall pass on your gratitude to all those you mentioned .
Despite genuine efforts in the last three years to reinforce the rule of law , the Government has had to recognise that insecurity and impunity were deeply rooted in Guatemala .
The latest figures from the Association of European Airlines indicate that there are now more than 150 million air passengers a year .
Last year , we had what was known as the Year of Lifelong Learning , and we talked about the fact that going back into education for a second time provides people with new opportunities and / or a new career .
I want to conclude by expressing deep satisfaction on behalf of the Commission that the European Parliament has now concluded its part of this process and we hope to see it concluded in general as soon as possible .
That is not what we are here for .
The MKO is a degenerate organisation , which is tantamount to a religious sect and which severely oppresses its own members , including within the camp .
Today , we thank the Austrian people for this democratic triumph which is important to all nations within Europe and to anyone who feels particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech .
I do not know if they translate well , but they said these exact words , &apos; no crime whatsoever &apos; .
Kazakhstan itself has serious problems with the democratic deficit and has not ratified either .
The reality is that data is flowing across the Atlantic and we , and our citizens , have no protection at present .
Research has shown that in a study on 4 000 plants , no less than 22 % were classified as threatened .
Nevertheless , in the event that there is evidence of unacceptable practices , you may rest assured that I would have the means to act .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the rapporteur , Mr Weber , wondered why this Parliament did not see some of the positive measures introduced by this proposal for a directive .
President Barroso , I should like to ask you a question regarding the future of the automobile sector which , indeed , will remain one of the most important industrial sectors even after 2020 .
16 . (
Ladies and gentlemen , the Lisbon Treaty will have an impact on the entire range of services of the European Parliament and the other institutions .
I believe Parliament will take another step in that direction tomorrow .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
If this fund is not being used very much , it means that it needs to be reviewed and reformed .
Coordination is , of course , the key to success .
Firstly , Sweden &apos;s national legislation , including the statute of the national central bank , was not compatible with Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks .
A project like Desertec must not therefore be a way of using energy policy as a means to continue colonialism .
According to the Commission proposal it should continue to be possible to export non @-@ hazardous waste to the countries approached ( both to those countries which replied that they did not want to receive any or only certain forms of non @-@ hazardous waste for recycling and to those countries which did not reply ) , using a cumbersome authorization procedure .
That is why the Commission insists that there must be a moratorium on international adoptions until legislation is in force that is fully up to international standards on child protection and until administrative structures are in place to ensure that such legislation is enforced .
Certainly the Commission , Parliament and Member States &apos; governments have all worked closely together to ensure that the Stockholm Summit will be a success .
Commissioner , having heard your proposed reductions , I doubt that the famous European model of agriculture can continue because there is not just one model but two : the successful model and the poor model .
Even more effective collaboration between the EU institutions is indispensable .
We will all be happy ! &apos;
Current rules stipulate that 10 % of the Fund &apos;s resources be allocated to these tasks .
We share your views on civil @-@ military relations .
It seems to me that the current government of Nicaragua is doing many of the things that need doing in order to address this problem .
It deals with political , legal and financial sanctions which should at one and the same time act as both an aid and a deterrent .
Commissioner Schreyer referred to the rate of increase in the budget &apos;s commitments , which stands at 0.26 % .
For the first time you have a legal basis for ensuring that a provider of universal services is also adequately remunerated for this , for the first time !
( ES ) Mr President , Mrs Morgantini &apos;s words are very moving and we cannot help but show our solidarity with these duly documented cases of alleged violation of the human rights of Palestinian prisoners .
We must also come up with long term initiatives to improve the socio @-@ democratic situation and democracy in Karelia .
It is also important that societal stakeholders are more strongly represented .
With the safety network , we will achieve clarity together with the necessary flexibility .
I don &apos;t think there &apos;s anything to get worked up about .
I would like to assure you of my personal commitment and of that of the Commission , as stated once again by President Prodi this morning , to doing everything to ensure that we do not have to apply the mechanism stated in Article 7 .
I hope that it will become clear when we embark on discussions with the three Baltic states that the security of these three states is in good hands in the European Union .
Before I share what I have observed while working on this report , it is important to underline that its scope is partly limited by the fact that the operational programmes were only approved in June 2008 and it will take at least a year before any real advances in their implementation can be assessed .
The report goes too far where it lumps together religion , fundamentalism and human rights violation .
You cannot put it more clearly than that .
Secondly , we have to ensure that European Union law is sufficiently flexible within the bounds of safety to allow new products to be developed .
In order to permit the continuation of the ICTY &apos;s mandate , we urge the Council to encourage the Security Council to provide sufficient resources from its general budget , not least to be able to retain key specialists and highly qualified staff .
What is needed is work from the bottom up , building the social awareness and solidarity of women .
There is an Estonian saying - the more languages , the more lives .
We must be aware of this risk and of the need to take steps to prevent it .
Drivers , both employed and self @-@ employed , are permitted to drive for an average of 45 hours per week in a two @-@ week period , as Commissioner Tajani has also pointed out .
Ten years on , this debacle is still a subject for debate in the Netherlands .
May he rest in peace .
I give my support to the Commission , and to Mrs Ghilardotti , and I hope that this own @-@ initiative report bears fruit .
The Commission &apos;s decision to establish annual priorities for resettlement is an implementing decision , and forms part of the financial management of the European Refugee Fund .
This Parliament ’ s procedures leave us in a position of weakness .
On the institutional side , there are obvious issues to be resolved , including the questions of representation in Parliament , voting in the Council and the composition of the Commission , while detailed suggestions have been made in relation to the EU Foreign Minister and the presidency of the Council ministries .
Any dialogue which may enable us to improve the situation will be welcomed , but on the basis that these persons are unconditionally released and a guarantee is in place for refugees to be able to return .
That is a major step forward - one of the real achievements of these negotiations .
Nevertheless , the Member States are free to apply these Directives in the manner they consider most appropriate to satisfying national conditions and needs , and also to establish stricter minimum rules provided that they conform to Community rules and , in particular , the principles of the Treaty .
It is indeed important for the Council to take a political stand , but it must be followed up .
Moreover , following Parliament &apos;s commitment to enable better access to generic medicines , I am delighted that the provisions on public health have been included and that our wish has been respected that any demands that would limit our partners &apos; ability to make use of the flexibilities provided for in the atypical Doha declaration agreement should not be included .
A disaster has occurred and has claimed victims - others have occurred in the past - and it is only natural that one should question its causes .
In eight days &apos; time , the committee will have to vote on what we are going to do about giving discharge , and on what proposals we are going to put to plenary .
The Mexican authorities should therefore renew their commitment to make progress in the field of human rights in cooperation with international partners , including the important UNHCR programme in Mexico .
I have always had the greatest respect for Mr Hoppenstedt &apos;s contribution in this area , even before I took over this portfolio on behalf of the Commission , but I must be absolutely frank about one thing , and Mr Hoppenstedt knows that it is a point of difference between us . What Parliament is proposing here with these amendments may well be the position which eventually emerges as a compromise from the Council .
If the Czech Parliament also ratifies the Treaty of Lisbon tomorrow , this will mean that we were completely fobbed off back then .
Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina has at last embarked on the task of amending its constitution , because that is necessary in order that it might draw nearer to the European Union .
This is unfair .
For example , an attempt is made in Amendments Nos 4 and 13 , in the first part of Amendment No 6 and in the second part of Amendment No 8 to provide a more detailed definition of the umbrella organizations .
In addition , the Commission has established , as an extension to the communication in hand , two channels for debate .
Human beings have a tendency to bury their heads in the sand .
In many instances the supermarkets in the European Union are worsening standards by forcing down food prices .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , there is a clear common denominator in today &apos;s important joint debate on fisheries .
Therefore , the Committee on Legal Affairs has expressed a clear opinion in these three cases : it has already expressed this opinion in the past and I am sure that it will do so again in the future , simply because it is now consolidated practice .
I live in Ireland , I represent Dublin , which is on the east coast of Ireland .
The real reason why the big energy companies , like RWE and E.ON , fought this directive tooth and nail behind the scenes in the Commission , in this House and in the Council , right up to the very end , is that the prospect of a market in the saving of energy terrifies them .
What is the Council doing at the WTO and other global fora to raise awareness and encourage higher production standards around the world , giving better protection for workers and consumers ?
I am concerned , perhaps more concerned than you , with our citizens &apos; concerns and preoccupations .
I can only remark that during my visit to Turkey last week we had intensive discussions with the authorities there , as it were in preparation of a visit planned by the President of the European Council , the Foreign Minister of Luxembourg , for 27 November and also in preparation of an Association Council with Turkey that will take place on 24 November .
That is the nub of the problem .
( DE ) Commissioner , it is always a great pleasure to listen to what you have to say and to discuss issues with you .
Nonetheless , free access is not all that is needed .
We are in a situation we have never been in before , and that is why I welcome the dynamic leadership we have had , in contrast with Mr Kirkhope &apos;s party , whose members , like rabbits paralysed in the headlights , think that doing nothing is the only solution to our great crisis .
These credits exist , and I think that they must be utilised in order to provide more effective support for the development of the real economy , innovation and employment .
The Middle East is the European Union &apos; s neighbour .
However , it is clear and necessary that we need to set up a permanent crisis resolution mechanism with strong in @-@ built conditionalities and also disincentives for its use .
Security without freedom is dictatorship , freedom without security is anarchy , and justice is impossible without freedom or security .
Similar plans for Europe are now being held up by the Council , but are still not off the agenda .
On behalf of women in the Member States , I also regret the neo @-@ liberal economic policy , with its deregulation and privatisation , which makes women ’ s situation still more difficult where both job opportunities and access to childcare and care of the elderly are concerned .
Before we proceed with our agenda , I just note for the benefit of Members in the House that last week I made a brief working visit to Cyprus .
It has been a disaster , but that must not mean either a saving or a diversion of the funds which had been already approved .
Agreed , I am sorry .
The report makes a good contribution to this process .
You do not know whether to laugh or to cry when , in Recital 2 , the Commission writes that account must be taken of the interests of consumers , knowing full well that the organisation of the sugar market triples consumer prices for all products containing sugar .
The areas of justice and public administration are being reformed and the fight against corruption is being strengthened .
We use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision ; and that should also be done in the future .
This is a genuine revolution in the Commission &apos;s management culture .
It recognises the prime role of Member States in promoting the health and safety agenda .
We have made representations both in Tel Aviv , as the troika , and , as Presidency , to the Israeli Ambassador in Spain .
Maintenance obligations (
in writing . - ( PT ) Following the implementation of the US legislative reform that reinforced security requirements under the visa waiver programme , the USA decided to propose separate memoranda of understanding to each Member State in an attempt to divide and rule .
Furthermore , in order to ensure appropriate and effective coordination of humanitarian aid , a European civil protection force and a European rapid reaction capacity must be created .
While I am respectful of the views that they hold , I would respectfully remind them of the decision both of this Parliament and , indeed , of the European Council on the issue of opening accession talks on 3 October – recognising , of course , the work that is presently under way .
In my country , Finland , the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health has launched a project for 1998 - 2002 to prevent violence against women ; the endorsement of the Daphne programme was very important also from this standpoint .
Madam President , freedom of association is a general principle of Community law ; the European Court of Justice has clearly recognised this .
Therefore , I have three remarks to make .
This is a compulsory exercise which everyone engages in .
We must , however , also be smart enough not to do something for which we will have to pay a high price later on .
Surely more is needed than has been offered in the statement today .
One of the priorities is the prevention of violence between people .
We are very well aware that these programmes are not intended to replace individual national policies - which should be strengthened by them - but to become an important reference point both in developing the transnational dimension in human resources actions , and in the ongoing process of reforming the education systems in all the Member States .
Members of the European Parliament can also play a significant part in this process by discussing long @-@ term climate policy with parliamentarians from countries outside the European Union , for example at the forthcoming Tenth Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change .
The Commission is one guilty party .
After all , like China , Saudi Arabia is a rich country and we can venture to be rather more flexible when the noble principles we have been discussing so often this week are at stake .
The second answer to the challenges of globalisation is that the EU must increase and promote the use of the social dialogue in both the EU and the rest of the world .
Can the Commissioner promise that specific attention will be paid to this aspect in the evaluation report , and that it will be made clear which results have been achieved ?
We cannot say that action had to be taken because 12 years had passed during which the regime of Saddam Hussein had not respected the United Nations resolutions when we have been waiting three decades for Resolution 242 to be complied with .
By establishing new measures designed to combat cetacean by @-@ catches , this proposal for a regulation not only provides a response to the scientific papers but also makes a significant contribution to eradicating catches of cetaceans whose conservation would otherwise be threatened .
The concern I would have is that the eight biophysical criteria proposed by the Commission might be too restrictive when they are adopted .
A great deal of money for culture is also set aside in the Structural Funds , and this is something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind .
The American economy , as we are forever being told , is on hold and this situation is decidedly bad for growth .
The EU must show that it is open to adopting a policy of reconciling interests .
One of the most important associates of the future must be one which is currently divided into 15 : the European Union .
That is of the utmost importance if Hizbollah are to be denied the excuse that they need to have weapons in the area , since it is Israeli @-@ occupied territory .
- The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mr Schröder , on behalf of the Committee on Development , on the development impact of Economic Partnership Agreements ( EPAs ) .
The first is a word of thanks to Mr Toubon and the way in which he has directed the whole process .
The next item is the joint debate on :
Syria , Bahrain and Yemen have been rocked by protests , which have been savagely repressed .
Composition of Parliament : see Minutes
The way in which we approach dialogue with third countries , conditionality , the terms of the discourse we use to speak out against certain situations , whether or not we apply double standards depending on the proportions or the strategic importance of such @-@ and @-@ such a country , all of this we feel ought to be thoroughly examined , and we hope it is considered in future versions of our annual reports .
In addition , we should remember that nobody is in the European Union for budgetary reasons .
In its statement of 4 March this year , the Presidency assessed Cuba &apos;s signing of the two pacts as positive .
We note with particular satisfaction that the programme includes an aim to reform working practices in the Council .
We particularly agree with the difficult compromise between achieving greater competitiveness whilst not abandoning the policy of economic and social cohesion .
Of particular importance is the fact that education has been emphasised as an independent area of focus .
It is well @-@ known that the service of the above documents is a serious issue , with a significant impact on both the process of justice and civil and commercial relations .
I refer here to Amendment 1 to Recital 11 , to new Recital 15a and to Amendment 6 to Article 1 .
The terrorists in Algeria are knifing hundreds of innocent citizens almost daily , including women , children and journalists , as the President of the Council has mentioned .
This is our common vision of democracy and of our values .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this is a discussion in which , apart from a few minor points which I shall now explain , we are in agreement with the Commission &apos;s proposal .
I welcome the fact that we can deem the 2011 budget the &apos; youth &apos; budget .
All states have a responsibility to work together to combat the threat of international terrorism .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like to address a subject which has not yet been discussed today in this connection .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , it is only natural for revolutionary events to be accompanied by a great deal of emotion .
I would take as an example the storage of traffic data for up to two years , which was opposed by my group but supported by the majority in this House .
Therefore , Mr Solana was undoubtedly too quick off the mark - as the Council has also said - in taking a stance , in signalling his intention to attend , without having a mandate from the Council and without having heard the opinion of the European Parliament .
The European women ’ s lobby has initiated important campaigns , such as the campaign for increased involvement by women in the European elections , has prompted a debate on the constitution , and is monitoring enlargement with a particular eye on equal opportunities issues .
Moreover , one in two women farmers fall within the spouse or partner category , which is particularly detrimental to their entitlement to social security .
That would make our life much easier , but it is just wishful thinking and pie in the sky .
Let me , nevertheless , emphasise that the potential revenues of a general FTT would be very asymmetric , probably located in only a few countries that have the largest financial centres .
What would then be left to prescribe ?
Since then , the Council , at its Brussels Summit , has also adopted parts of this position taken by Parliament , examples being the principle of progressive integration for direct payments to agriculture , the clarification that , after enlargement , none of the new Member States should become net contributors , and a ruling intended to prevent a country from being in a worse financial position after accession than it was immediately before it .
I would be surprised if Parliament were now to hold a less well @-@ prepared debate on the issue of Afghanistan , also at the risk of mixing up the two debates .
Madam President , I would agree with everything that my colleague , Mr Karim , has just said and , in particular , that self @-@ determination is of crucial importance - even more so for peoples divided by history .
I hope that the Commission and the Council will respond positively to our proposal .
The next item is report ( A4 @-@ 0013 / 98 ) by Mrs Read , on behalf of the European Parliament &apos;s delegation to the Conciliation Committee , on the joint text , approved by the Conciliation Committee , for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the application of open network provision ( ONP ) to voice telephony and on universal service for telecommunications in a competitive environment ( amendment of European Parliament and Council Directive 95 / 62 / EC ) ( C4 @-@ 0003 / 98 @-@ 96 / 0226 ( COD ) ) .
These amendments do not seem appropriate to us in this context , however , as they do not relate directly to the directive on construction products , which is the object of Mr Langen &apos;s report .
On this issue , Mrs Lalumière is left quaking in her boots in her otherwise excellent report .
Mr President , I too should like to thank the rapporteurs very much for all of their preparatory work .
We all remember well the Lloyds case which we recently looked into .
This fund provides the best opportunity we have partly for slowing down the spread of these three diseases and , at the same time , for reducing the consequences for those who are already suffering from the symptoms .
The Commission is fully committed to continuing work on the development of Europeana and the policies related to it and that will be a key area of work in the European Digital Agenda .
With their accumulated human capital , the active workers from the new European Union Member States have the ability to stimulate long @-@ term economic growth .
I , too , would like to quote a famous American , who was not a philosopher but a tennis player .
For 84 pills , the price in Malta is EUR 104.82 as compared to EUR 21.71 in Brussels .
But , thanks to an ECJ judgment , some innocent people &apos;s data will now be returned .
I will suggest that it draws conclusions from them .
This practice is so gruesome that the EU should be duly alarmed and we – that is , Parliament , the Commission and the Council – must do all we can to provide ourselves with the means to stop such trafficking from proliferating any further , from becoming any bigger and from making a few unscrupulous people and their criminal networks any richer .
In this regard , I am delighted at the clear distinction made between public procurement and concessions , and at the call for a legislative initiative on the latter .
This is a model of how to move transport from the railways to the roads - exactly the opposite of what the competent Commissioner and the EU always claim to be aiming for .
. Yes , I will .
Allow us to move forward .
Since my country is a Mediterranean State , such a process is viewed with great attention .
This regulation was abolished in 2003 in favour of Forest Focus , which is currently provided with EUR 61 million for ecological protection programmes and only EUR 9 million for the fight against fires .
First , an import system from third countries should be put in place , which will ensure predictable and regular import quantities .
It is also the case , of course , that we must produce statistics and watch how they evolve , because if we are to provide real resources , if we are truly committed and provide the money needed to implement these essential programmes , we need to be able to see how they evolve so that we can put things right in time and be as effective as possible .
That is something we should really question .
On environmental liability I tend to take the Commission &apos; s view that this is best dealt with through horizontal legislation .
You have left us with high levels of unemployment in the EU and the idea of a two @-@ speed Europe , that is to say , of a superior and an inferior Europe .
Mrs Hautala , the rapporteur , has produced an excellent piece of work .
I think these are the two first steps upon which the process of negotiation should be based .
This must be recognised at Vienna as , indeed , must the renewed interest in Malta .
Mr President , at the end of this debate , I would once again like to say that the decommissioning of the nuclear power plants in Lithuania , Slovakia and Bulgaria has been based on international expertise .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party is very happy to support those initiatives which give young people in Europe opportunities to acquire knowledge , skills and qualifications which will help form the basis of their future development .
I know that football supporters in parts of the Union have strongly criticised the size of the EUR 1 , 000 fine .
I refer to the recent development – at least it is a positive step – of allowing broadcasts in the Kurdish language at certain times on the television and radio .
In this sense we hope that the Commission will provide an exhaustive answer to our questions and will take our proposals seriously , so that interinstitutional cooperation produces the results that European agriculture deserves and shows its solidarity by offering practical support to European farmers in crisis , who need our help today .
The Scottish National Party &apos;s vision of an independent Scotland is one of a clean , green Scotland profiting from our natural heritage and healthy environment .
I will just read you the language .
Certain Russian politicians have claimed that NGOs are a tool used by third countries to conduct foreign policy in Russia , but these arguments are absurd and make a mockery of the concept of democracy .
With this thought in mind , we took initiatives , as soon as we assumed the Presidency , for an initial evaluation of the adequacy of our framework for cooperation with Russia .
They include the need to maintain an adequately funded common agricultural policy for the Union .
What are they going to get , 20 or 40 years from now , in return for the high contributions they have to pay today ?
That is an issue which the High Representative and I are attempting to take on more positively .
The ability to reassign cancelled authorisations requested in paragraph 20 would undermine the intended effect - that projects are implemented quickly - and so we cannot support it .
Madam President , the term ‘ sophisticated alternative investment vehicles ’ is such a sophisticated phrase that I shall replace it with the expression ‘ hedge funds ’ .
The realisation of the Ahtisaari plan , the latest in a series that includes the Carrington Plan , the Dayton Agreement , the Rambouillet negotiations , and the Ohrid Agreement , also demonstrates that there is still a long way to go before we can consider relations among the different ethnic groups and national communities in our region to have been settled .
The noise impact differs even within the same airport according to the runway used .
The contents of this thematic programme are the expression again of a finely balanced compromise , in particular with the Member States in the Council .
Voting time
Mr President , I should like to start by echoing some of the concerns of my colleague , Mr Wynn , at the paucity of solid measures being introduced to deal with unemployment .
Moreover , in some Central and Eastern European Member States , people who disregarded human rights or sent people to camps or to their death without following the legal procedure are still in office and held in esteem .
We know that detergents are a major source of phosphates .
With regard to European policy and its relevance to Member States , I believe we should introduce a period of reflection before embarking on further dependence on nuclear energy .
At that time the idea of the spy @-@ in @-@ the @-@ sky was an emotive issue .
. – The aim of Culture 2007 is to modify the procedures used for awarding grants so that they are simpler than those used in the context of Culture 2000 .
Nothing .
However , for certain political groups , the question is clearly not one of arriving at a consensus and producing a reasonable text , but one of systematically boycotting the Directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions .
Finally , let me address a few words to Mr Tabajdi , and I will try to use my best Hungarian :
This results directly from Denmark &apos;s protocol to the Treaty .
In the vote today I voted in favour of the introduction of the right to choose an appropriate court for divorce proceedings .
Thank you , and I wish you the best of luck during your presidency .
Do we prefer to reduce these workers to a workforce liable to the corvée ?
Under the new Treaty , the vast majority of European laws will be adopted jointly by the European Parliament and by the Council in full respect of the Commission &apos;s right of initiative .
Let nobody tell me such a scenario is impossible ; it is no more improbable than the one on which the chancelleries are currently working .
The actual steps in relation to this include the adoption of proposals for simplifying the third and sixth directives applying to mergers and breakups of commercial undertakings at the first reading in the European Parliament , and also approving a revision of the fourth and seventh directives .
&apos;The European Parliament and the Council , notwithstanding the competences of the budgetary authority , agree that the transition to new conditions of employment of accredited parliamentary assistants does not in itself require an increase in the appropriations entered in the European Parliament section of the general budget of the European Union and intended to cover parliamentary assistance , with respect to the appropriations entered for this purpose in the budget for the financial year 2008 , subject to indexation .
However , I am still not in a position to report any conclusions ; the Council cannot of course draw conclusions until the reports it commissioned are actually available .
That is not true .
The victims sign a contract in good faith to be advertised in a business directory after having been led to believe that this would be free of charge .
That is why many countries found themselves in a situation without heat and gas at the start of last year , despite all the solidarity and goodwill of the EU .
The one issue that needs to be stressed is the consumers &apos; lack of awareness of the problem of unregulated , unreported and illegal fishing and that is something we need to speak more about .
At the end of the year , when we present this study , it will be most beneficial to organise an awareness @-@ raising campaign on those filters in order to inform parents what they can do to help their children .
Faulty diagnoses which might result from incorrect use must be prevented at all costs , so it is vital that all possible sources of error are eliminated .
From this point of view , I believe that , even on the basis of the position assumed by Parliament today , we need to assign the Commissioner a new mandate so that he will not only continue the work he has performed so far , but he will establish new bases for tickets , from the quantitative point of view , and start on the rules .
The Council is inviting us to explain how this procedure should work .
It was an emergency .
The proposals on traceability and labelling , as well as on food and feed , are not based entirely on the detectability of GMOs .
I believe competition is not an end but a means .
The European Union has an increasingly important role to play in helping to protect the environment , not only at Community level , but also in developing countries .
I believe that we can agree on our common commitment to reinforcing the democratic nature of European integration .
Mr President , yet again the European Union is not keeping pace with the situation in Europe , as it wishes to keep European economies within the shackles of the Growth and Stability Pact . We all know that the criteria of this Pact are now completely obsolete .
In the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue , a debate on the reform of the European Schools could not be of greater importance , as we live in a multicultural and multilingual Europe , where different cultures and languages coexist .
This is what is stated in Article 28 of the Treaty then , and the Member States sending troops are liable for other costs on a national basis .
It is other interested parties who wish to see the standards in the Directive reduced and I sincerely hope that this House will reject such Directives and proposals which would mean that the type of safety data sheet which we already have in Sweden , Finland and Austria , for example , can no longer continue to be used in the future .
Mrs Poisson , could you let us know if you accept the amendments ?
Quite apart from any talk about stopping building programmes , the reality is that the only country that can get the North Korean Government to return to the six @-@ party talks is the People ’ s Republic of China , with the Chinese Communist Party .
In addition , delegations in countries where migration has emerged as an important new topic in the context of Community external assistance are also assisted by the departments in Brussels through training measures , thematic networks at operational level and support missions .
Today we shall debate the South Caucasus and the Black Sea .
Its effect is also linked very much to the sound implementation of other directives , such as the Reception and the Procedures Directives .
This investment , Mr President , is a great reflection of the European Union &apos;s confidence in and commitment to the whole Latin American and Caribbean region and without doubt makes a great contribution to the growth of economic activity and the creation of employment in that region .
The path of democratisation and reform often means internal political crises , especially in this situation , where they are provided by a large neighbouring state .
And that is our responsibility .
The fact is , we need a Europe which is more flexible and accords greater respect to its nations .
Regarding the concerns relating to the lack of a recycling target for manufacturing and industrial waste , my services will look into the possibility of setting such a target as the first priority within the context of the 2014 review , which is foreseen in Article 8a ( point 4 ) .
We are all aware of the substantial cultural and economic challenges the Television without Frontiers Directive presents for each of the Member States of the Union and the candidate countries .
Bridges , roads , waterways , railways , electricity stations , government buildings and even hospitals have been destroyed , not to mention the dead , coyly referred to as collateral damage , or their families .
I will therefore focus on some of the main issues .
Fine . I think this proposal is perfectly acceptable .
Let us , the European Parliament , lead the way in preventing these deaths .
It will be a tough battle .
The possibility of at least a partial solution is now arising in the form of enhanced cooperation between some Member States in establishing unitary patent protection .
It cannot be successful if we only operate in the area of the recommendations .
Mr President , were we not required to vote on paragraph 6 ?
The integrated guidelines will have to be fine @-@ tuned in the course of the next three @-@ year period .
( PL ) Mr President , despite what has been said by other Members in this House , the proposed directive came about as a response to the increasingly widespread theft of intellectual property .
Her murderers have still not been brought to justice .
I therefore call for a greater application of the EU principle of non @-@ discrimination in all these areas , too , because mobility also needs underpinning socially with some minimum standards so that persons who are mobile are not disadvantaged in other ways .
The directive may well therefore raise hopes of cross @-@ border consumer rights that it does not fulfil .
The Commission is standing by its commitment to the peace process , hence Commissioner Patten and the Columbian foreign secretary recently signed an agreement on financing initial peace work .
I cannot give a detailed answer to his request but , like Mr Patten , I am able to inform you that my colleague , Mr Møller , is in the Middle East right now to present a proposal from the EU for a practical timetable or &apos; road map &apos; for establishing a legitimate Palestinian state by June 2005 .
Zimbabwe must abide by its international commitments , including the African Charter of Human and Peoples &apos; Rights , by repealing all its national laws which contravene the international texts on the protection of human rights .
The Commission takes its responsibility to ensure macro @-@ financial stability in the euro area and the EU as a whole .
( Limited applause )
Let us be clear and honest here : the underlying goal is to put in place footings for a pan @-@ European justice system which will undoubtedly undermine British law .
We appreciate this opportunity to hold an exchange of views at an early stage in the 2009 annual budget procedure .
6 .
That is why the Commission regrets that the terms which might allow the National League for Democracy and all the other legal representatives to participate in the national assembly are not being met .
Various examples have been given by the Ombudsman , and can be read at leisure in the report .
The concern addressed in the inquiry that we attached to this was right , but we should not anticipate the result .
- ( SK ) Madam President , the amendment of the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment has gone through an extensive consultation process in the relevant European Parliament committees .
( The President cut off the speaker )
Madam President , I would like to talk about the report by Mr Purvis on electronic money .
Getting young people more involved in the field and the life of local , national and European communities and fostering active citizenship represents an important challenge for our societies .
Secondly , I would like to know what you think about postponing the elections , because that is again on the agenda .
Fortunately , our agricultural sector is still organic , and there are no demands to introduce innovations for economic reasons .
The aim of the directive is to harmonise the way software patents are registered at the European Patent Office and in Member States , when they are granted .
Finally , the report is concerned with what we might call the framework for flexicurity . In other words , the national terms and conditions for implementing flexibility and security .
That is something that is now , fortunately , in the past .
They produce forged notes and coins of such high quality , which even have imitations of the security features , that the man on the street is easily taken in by the forged 50 @-@ euro notes .
We should consider other forms of multi @-@ annual regulation from a statutory point of view .
( Applause ) All that meant nothing to them .
I remember your predecessor &apos; s speech five years ago .
We must realise , however , that the path for a possible mission must be assessed very carefully , because Common Security and Defence Policy missions are one of the instruments we have available , but they are no replacement for a political strategy .
However , I would like to say that we need more than EMU .
It is an issue which requires special attention .
That is unjustified and counterproductive , particularly at a time when the sector is ready to invest resources in the production of the new technologies which will provide new jobs and wider access to sources of information for European citizens .
I feel we should take advantage of such momentum and continue spreading this dialogue in order to create control mechanisms at European level with the aim of protecting minority groups .
Satisfying though this is , it is overshadowed by the fact that , at the present time , the application of the is still in abeyance in the occupied sector of the island and that talks between the communities seem at present to have become deadlocked .
However , several Member States have established public cord blood banks based on altruistic and voluntary cord blood donation .
This fills me , personally , with very great optimism .
I give the floor to Mr Flynn to answer Mr Evans &apos; question .
I support these demands which are contained in the amendments tabled by the rapporteur .
This , I think , is the most essential of the rightful demands the international community has to make of China when it takes over this territory .
It is proposed that the convention , when it comes into operation , will apply to civil procedures relating to the invalidity of a marriage , divorce , and the legal separation of spouses .
I would like to thank the two rapporteurs for having raised these socio @-@ economic problems , which create more anguish and social insecurity for our fellow citizens than almost anything else .
I also wish your successor well .
It is quite simply impossible .
The committee was disconcerted , surprised , confused by this , and therefore rejected my amendment .
This is the opening gambit and not the end game .
In view of the need for increased security of gas supplies , we should take steps to establish a common energy policy as soon as possible .
That concludes the explanations of vote .
Those colleagues who attended parts of the visit or the various political group meetings were very welcome .
Lastly , enlargement cannot be successful if Europe does not place social issues at the heart of the process , in particular the issue of the living and working conditions of the various peoples .
The first and the main victims of this miserable market- and competitiveness @-@ based policy are women .
Is it for ideologues or for the people ?
( NL ) Mr President , I am happy to hear Parliament saying that all Member States must guarantee media pluralism and that public service broadcasters certainly have an important role there .
That is no mean number !
Before I begin I will take the liberty of expressing my consternation at the way in which Austria has been prejudged by 14 Council representatives .
Parliament has new powers .
Institutions for occupational retirement provision
Women live five years longer than men on average and are more affected by physical and psychological problems linked to ageing .
As an institution , we should be setting an example , which means that we should also be bold enough to save .
Mr President , tourism is a major source of income for many developing countries and it has a significant impact on the transformation of their economies .
You are all very welcome to attend .
This view was , by the way , reiterated last week in Mexico City .
I would like to ask Mrs Palacio to look into this matter again .
This report recommends far @-@ reaching EU measures aimed at improving the situation of women within , primarily , the fisheries sector .
Europe &apos;s citizens expect more robust measures from the EU institutions aimed at not only bringing financial stability but also , in particular , at returning to sustainable economic growth .
And that really needs to be made quite clear .
In what we consider one of our most important achievements , in July of this year we were able to turn on electricity and water to parts of our capital city , Monrovia , for the first time in 15 years .
What I very much look forward to , however , is receiving information from the Commission about the political misuse of psychiatry by Beijing .
I would therefore point out that an improvement of 45 % , for example , in relation to CO2 emissions , is an element that must be taken into account .
On closer inspection , the arguments advanced by the rapporteur are spurious , particularly his reference to supposedly higher thresholds for the formation of a political group in the parliaments of Member States .
These two good reasons , which inspired the most splendid political idea of the twentieth century , clearly remain just as meaningful . Enlargement of the European Union is consistent with the open and generous vision of the original European project .
Secondly , taxation has to be changed to encourage people to work .
UN facilities have been attacked .
Many European partners too are still failing to meet the mark .
That is the piece of legislation that I am promoting - the food and feed legislation .
In addition , the VVD cannot see the point of promoting a model for European education and training .
There is no such scepticism when it comes to security and defence policy .
It cannot possibly go forward .
Let us make sure we oppose it in our own cities , towns and homes .
Third , we commissioned an independent consultant to carry out an impact assessment of the legislative options set out in the Green Paper .
The analyses by the Central Bank and by the Commission may help in this direction .
Some are speaking of a 1989 moment for the Arab world , but whether or not that is the case remains to be seen .
Frankly , I do not understand the argument over which comes first , economic growth or jobs .
That also means that the lower income groups – who , contrary to what is often asserted , are not saving more than they used to – must either have their wages increased or their taxes cut , all the more so as there is sufficient political room for manoeuvre , productivity having risen much faster than pay over recent years .
The dynamism and desired growth of the European economy will not come about by creating Union @-@ wide integrated programmes , whether they be applied with good intentions in the area of training or entrepreneurship or whether they be common support systems for the benefit of SME organisations .
As such , we would like to reiterate our opposition to it , with the arguments to back this up : we are talking about the defence , through various means including soldiers and diplomats , of the European powers &apos; economic and geostrategic interests , in collaboration with the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ( NATO ) .
Next , control and enforcement along the entire chain to ensure road safety .
The sooner he disappears , the better things will be .
Action at a local level also has a critical role to play .
Not least , I would also like to thank the Commission , represented in this case by Commissioner Verheugen .
In relation to the tragic events that occurred in Yerevan on 1 March in the aftermath of the election , the Commission shares the general concern over the violent clashes between police and opposition demonstrators , which resulted in a number of deaths .
We first need to vote on the amendment that would replace the former wording .
We could have dealt with this disaster on the basis of a simple principle - that of the assumption of responsibilities : by the British producers of Doncaster , in Yorkshire ; by the British Government ; and by the French importers .
The EU should urgently develop new policies in this area .
As I have already said , other conflicts relating to religious differences are very important and we should be careful not to overlook or marginalise these other aspects .
Language policies need to be dealt with at very many levels .
Neither I , nor indeed Parliament , need a report .
It is estimated that there are currently 200 000 to 300 000 children directly involved in armed conflicts in over 20 countries around the world .
Such a mechanism would tease out the issues in need of debate in Ireland , would let the Irish electorate have their say and would finally allow Ireland to ratify the spirit of such treaties overall without stalling progress for other concerned parties .
At the Barcelona conference in November , wish lists will not be enough to persuade the Mediterranean partners .
There is no reference to ballistic @-@ missile defence , which indirectly but clearly proves it is being accepted through ΝΑΤΟ and the ΕU itself .
They must themselves decide what is in their interests .
That is the model on which the strengthened CAP should be based , without opening the door to its renationalization . Community preference must be incorporated , and we must not forget that we have a production deficit in some product areas , such as oilseed proteins , citrus fruits , fish and wood .
We need to analyse the reasons for this , and in particular to find out whether the fact that the Member States themselves also have to provide funding has anything to do with it .
On the other hand , however , there can be no doubt that the bottleneck in the budget and also the special WTO agreements represent a completely new challenge at the end of the day , particularly where export refunds are concerned .
The European Council will finalise this work at its next meeting and adopt a comprehensive package of measures to respond to the crisis , preserve financial stability and lay the ground for sustainable , job @-@ creating growth .
What puzzles me is what exactly is the status of the draft agreement brokered between Britain , the US and Turkey , between the European Union and the non @-@ European Union NATO European members ?
Some say we cannot afford such new financing .
The European Union therefore made a representation to the Afghan Government on 12 April .
It is a time for balance , certainly , but we all know that it is also time to make commitments , serious commitments : many important things have been said here , and the project specifications that we have in front of us are very long , enormously so .
So it is extremely difficult for the associations to take action internationally without major support from the European Union .
We wish you success in this and we ask you to think not just of engagement , but of promotion of European values , of human rights and democracy , so essential to the development of our world .
I do not wish to embark on a discussion of this issue now but you can rest assured I will pass on your remarks to the Bureau .
Left @-@ wing extremism is evidently something that by definition cannot exist , and clearly no @-@ one here has heard of the rising Islamic fundamentalism .
In this context , education , agricultural development , visa facilitation or , ideally , liberalisation , must be at the top of the agenda .
If fishermen want to make their boats safer they are prevented from doing so because it is suggested by the Irish authorities and by the Commission that they are adding to the capacity . This is totally untrue .
Third , trade is also affected , since trading opportunities that should be open to the developing countries with all their raw materials are almost certainly reduced .
Membership of committees and delegations : see Minutes
It does not come as a surprise .
However , all the texts which she has presented through a unanimous Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs have had an inexorable tendency to be devoid of any proposals . They are simply mediums for general requests .
The existing common fisheries policy has failed to achieve its objectives .
That is an important contribution .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
We shall be urging the Commission to come up with some directives very quickly , so that the new provisions can be made a real force for change in society .
At the same time as the fires , floods inundated Central and Eastern Europe and hurricane Katrina hit the southern states of the United States of America .
I leave it to you to decide , Mr President .
We have , however , been obliged to vote against some parts of the report . We have done this mainly because we do not think that the outermost regions should have special status and , thus , receive support that runs fundamentally counter to the Community ’ s other policies and values .
The structure of the negotiations themselves is still being finalised .
But reality has proven that it is right .
Every six seconds , a child dies of hunger on Earth .
This is especially important when there are cases pending that evidently show that an International Criminal Court is highly appropriate for judging , for example , criminals such as the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet who , over the past few weeks , has sought refuge in the loopholes of national laws . I would like to take this opportunity to say that I sincerely hope that next Wednesday will be a day to commemorate as the day on which the decision was taken to extradite Pinochet to Spain , where he will be judged on the crimes he has been accused of , crimes that include genocide , torture and terrorism .
Finally , I can assure you that the Commission will continue with the Member States , and in close collaboration with the candidate countries and the WHO , to do everything within its powers to defeat the spread of SARS .
We are concerned that the cessation of hostilities should not merely be an end in itself , but a real starting @-@ point for a dialogue leading to a definitive solution of the Kosovo problem , beginning with its autonomy . We must aim to solve all the problems of the Balkan region , bearing in mind what is now happening in Serbia - the closure of certain independent newspapers - and in Macedonia , from where the signs reaching us are anything but encouraging .
Therefore I did not vote for the resolution .
The fourth priority is the consideration which needs to be given to new risks .
Development must respect human dignity and the protection of the environment and health .
The full significance of this report is , however , only appreciated when it is seen in the context of the other efforts being made to intensify cooperation with South Africa , first and foremost the trade agreement already mentioned .
I would like to ask again a question already asked at the time of the Lebanese crisis : when can we expect , Mr Solano , the deployment of a European fleet in the Mediterranean like the one you have introduced to deal with piracy ?
You are an asset to this House and I hope you return .
I am not as reassured on this point as the rapporteur and I would have preferred to see a separate budget line which could have been seen and monitored more easily .
Allowing religion to influence these matters is not entirely helpful .
It is hypocritical because we are well aware that most of the States to which we are bound by these agreements lack the necessary capacity to carry out such inspections .
The discussions in the Council of Ministers will show whether there is scope to advance our positions further , which the Commission naturally welcomes .
Yet many people are not aware that EU law exists to help resolve insurance claims without having to deal with a foreign insurance company in a foreign language .
The way in which this treaty has come about is typical of the authoritarian behaviour and attitude of the Belarus Government .
I will restrict myself to paragraph 3 of the existing resolution , to the question of contacts with the Council and in what form , to what extent and when these should take place , and what the legal quality of the contacts would be .
At Community level , these conditions mean agreements with ever smaller fishing opportunities and with ever greater burdens and responsibilities for shipowners .
May I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Lambert , and thank him for his cooperation in the preparation of this document .
The restrictions described in Item 8 are , however , the wrong way to go about it .
I am particularly pleased that we have agreed on 2012 as the date for introducing the scheme .
This is indeed true , and it is also why we are trying to be much stricter .
This is the subject of political debate .
The Commission decided to carry out this examination within the framework of a Green Paper .
But if it really is a point of order , you have the floor .
But instead of coming to our conclusions , we see ourselves compelled to request a postponement .
We know , as the Commissioner said , that , if nothing is done , the arrangements will end in 2005 .
In these circumstances , all those who say that urgent action is needed are right .
( PL ) Madam President , children are our future .
Thus , there cannot be any illegal trade in organs because no trade in organs is allowed .
The Commission and the Council sought to change the status of the workers in that Foundation and we had to negotiate considerably to try and find a solution to that .
The economic crisis , as previously described by President Barroso , has been &apos; sudden and unexpected &apos; .
We have postponed the definitive abolition of tariffs on rice , banana and sugar imports until 2010 .
We regarded this report as an expensive exercise duplicating the work of Senator Marty in the Council of Europe .
The Commission greatly appreciates the fact that both the European Parliament , in particular the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control , and the European Court of Auditors have taken an early , active and , I would add , supportive interest in this first major CFSP joint action of the European Union .
The FISIM represent a part of the product of financial institutions which does not come from direct sales of services at a fixed price , but rather by charging an interest rate on the loans which is higher than that applied to deposits .
We fully support this initiative and we are concerned that it has not generated any fruitful outcome yet regarding the specific terms of facilitation .
However , the final decisions by the Council in 2005 on the review of the sugar sector could not meet these high expectations .
Mr President , well before the new digital tachograph is , can be , introduced , we will have to buckle down to further proposals for effective and more harmonized control .
Have we ever had a resolution before us which was so clear in terms of the abuses that we are seeking to have addressed by the European Union ?
Commissioner Wallström , at the time of the directive on release into the environment , you told us that liability would be incorporated in the environmental liability directive , but it was not .
I would like to support the comments he has made .
As you all know , the right to good administration is enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
. - ( FR ) Mr President , &apos; nothing is possible without men ; nothing is lasting without institutions &apos; .
My question is this : if you institute Treaty infringement proceedings without waiting for the results of the tests , when the tests have not even been carried out - we are still waiting for a proposal from Commissioner Byrne - and if the logistics for labelling have still not been set up , how then can you expect France and Germany to lift their import restrictions with this state of affairs ?
. – The Commission has proposed adaptations to the Acts of Accession of the 10 new Member States in order to take account of last year ’ s reforms of the common agricultural policy , particularly the introduction of the Single Farm Payment .
The first thing that Europe owes Russia is sincerity and clarity in the protection of the human rights and freedoms of our Russian fellow citizens of Europe .
Madam President , once again we are debating the crisis in the Middle East .
We must remember that 3.5 million barrels of crude oil , which is 4 % of world production , are transported every day through the 26.5 @-@ kilometre Bab @-@ el @-@ Mandeb Strait between Yemen and Djibouti .
Despite this , I believe that it can only strengthen the integration process , and that it is a further step towards the political unification of the European Union .
( RO ) Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to congratulate my fellow Members on the work they have done and the report they have compiled .
I think this amendment is extremely helpful , because it demonstrates that we are united in this Parliament in our refusal to accept irresponsibility .
This , whilst looking good , does not benefit the people who pay for them - the taxpayers .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , consensus was achieved at the Feira Summit a couple of weeks ago on the idea that flexibility should be on the IGC agenda .
B5 @-@ 0153 / 1999 by Mr Schori and Mr Wiersma , on behalf of the PSE Group , on the on @-@ going violation of human rights in Indonesia and in particular on the Moluccan Islands ;
I was not so clear - and this is why I would like to ask a supplementary question - about whether you seriously cannot accept the compromise that we propose in the report , namely that patent protection should be shorter with regard to generic medicines , so that the time can be used to begin research .
I should therefore like to take advantage of this opportunity to clarify some issues where I believe further explanation is still required .
Some other proposals even tend to promote flexicurity or , rather , the deregulation of the labour market , defending flexible and reliable contractual arrangements through modern labour laws , collective agreements and work organisation , with the indication that the Member States should implement their own action plans based on the common principles of flexicurity adopted by the Council .
We need to ensure closer cooperation between public institutions and the private sector and provide scope for private innovation funds . This report therefore strikes precisely the right chord .
The latter only receive access to the European market if a cooperation agreement is in place to ensure information exchange between the supervisory authorities .
Mr President , I should simply like to say that we always play by the same rules in this House , and you have restated those rules quite correctly .
People at the start of their professional careers may find that unemployment has a negative effect on their further activity in the labour market .
Although there is still a long way to go , particularly in the field of human rights , Turkey will belong to this Europe one day .
And I am surprised that the rapporteur , coming as she does from the south @-@ west of England , believes that Amendment No 11 which reduces the time allowed to Member States to postpone attainment of targets from four to two years and Amendment No 17 which reduces the compliance timetable by three years from eight years to five are practically achievable .
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria was in a hospital in Paris and still is , as far as I know .
Taking into account the above circumstances , as well as Georgia &apos;s strategic significance for the European Union in the European Neighbourhood Policy and the newly established Eastern Partnership , I endorsed the resolution on a Council Decision providing macro @-@ financial assistance to Georgia .
Mr President , Commissioner , this is not the first time that this Parliament has called for integration of the European Development Fund in the EU budget .
I believe that contracts of a similar type operate in Belgium .
It may be your last contribution to the development of our public health programmes , but you have made a significant contribution .
We will be further detailing the 2002 budget of the other institutions very shortly .
And it is our responsibility , as political leaders , to conceive bold initiatives in order to make this happen .
This would mean deleting programmes if they no longer produce value for money and creating programmes that are more relevant to a changing global environment .
I would just like to remind you that in 1980 there were simply suspicions , as there are suspicions now , that the AIDS virus was transmitted by blood and blood transfusions .
There has been extensive agreement with the Council and the Commission - we also had regular debates on this - and I therefore hope that the regulation can enter into force as planned in good time and that there will be no disparities between the current and the new preference period .
Preparations for Poland &apos;s membership of the OECD , the three Baltic countries &apos; membership of the WTO and Special Economic Zone status for the Kaliningrad region will also promote trade and investment in the area in a positive way .
European environmental legislation , especially the habitats directive and the water framework directive , must be respected .
Finally it is worth emphasising that the proposed solutions , particularly as regards the introduction of the European Reference Network , and also the European Network for Health Technology Assessment , provide an opportunity to raise the standards of medical care and also to make more effective use of healthcare resources in the European Union .
In addition , police action has curtailed the cruel methods of killing these dogs at the end of the hunting season .
Moscow broke international agreements when , at the beginning of August , its troops crossed the border into Georgia , a border which it had itself recognised in the past .
I believe this policy is not controversial , and we also support it .
In both cases the Article 29 Working Party has issued a positive opinion .
I do not believe it has been easy for any of us as politicians to curb our natural instinct either to improve on or alter someone else &apos; s text .
One of your stated priorities is the matter of Kosovo .
The Commission could not be more blind to the social reality in the Member States , or further removed from the citizens in their suffering .
In the future , these services and the way in which they are provided should be more precisely defined .
In my country , indeed , we find that public authorities or some public authorities at least - particularly members of the police force - are accomplices in the spread of this &apos; trade &apos; , if we can call it that .
We demand action from the presidency on the commitments it has made on the MDGs .
An obvious one is the collection of information , of comparable data which will help map out problems .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - Mr President , the Commission shares the honourable Member &apos;s view that the implementation of the 116 000 hotline for missing children requires further efforts in many Member States .
This should be resisted strongly , and fair value accounting must be supported in the face of such pressure .
What I will be calling for - and I am hopeful that the Commission will take this on board - is for the basic principles of customer care to be enshrined in clearly communicated legislation that is uniformly understood and simple .
Here I take issue with some of my colleagues here tonight .
It is important that this protection continue , including in the new Directive .
I do not want to be alarmist in any way but the fact that the British Government has already acted is something which should be taken into consideration .
I am worried that the report contains a double message .
I congratulate Mrs Haug for this balanced combination of those issues : short @-@ term realism and long @-@ term vision .
On the other hand , I regard as negligible the harmful effects on sleep rhythm and the serious consequences , about which such fears have been expressed , for the health of young schoolchildren and babies .
Beslan must not be exploited for political ends , whether in the Kremlin or here in the European Union .
What we are interested in is being able to offer ecologically as well as economically acceptable ways of obtaining sustainable energy to meet people &apos;s needs .
Secondly , the Commission has been transparent .
If we are able to make historic commitments on cutting emissions and set the tone for the whole world in terms of environmental protection , why can we not make a basic gesture in support of a clean environment and abolish this harmful practice from the European Union ?
All of us in this Chamber ought to have known that this draft would be overwhelmingly and justifiably rejected by European public opinion .
It is currently negotiating a new programme with the International Monetary Fund . Mr Farm also mentioned the need to extend the period agreed on , since that initially planned for implementation of contributions has expired .
Mr President , Commissioner , few issues contain so much political dynamite and evoke so many feelings as tax issues .
I think this was very well reflected also in the Lisbon Treaty , where it is very clear that Parliament &apos;s powers are very much strengthened and when we are going to include the national parliaments more in the European legislative process .
What would really be effective is if we had a trade import ban on China ; that would really cause headaches to the Communist leaders in Beijing and would lead to some sensible responses to our demands for freedom for Tibet .
The chief goal of the Eastern Partnership , which is concerned with six of our neighbouring countries , is to help those countries who want to come much more into line with the European Union on certain key issues like standards of governments , freer trade and others . In these activities , I think it is important that we have these countries as partners .
What are the objectives which each EU policy needs to take into account ?
Emerging countries have certainly not been greatly affected by this crisis .
I did not want to finish without saying I consider that , this week , Parliament and the European Union have lost a certain moral credibility to defend the rights of children , when yesterday this Chamber approved a shameful directive that allows the imprisonment of children for committing the crime of coming to Europe without papers .
I should like to make a point of thanking them all for their help .
We hear what the Treaty says about a Mr or Ms CFSP but with unanimity in the Council , how will Mr or Ms CFSP know with what voice to speak .
I fully support them , however , and I also fully support the idea that this Parliament should back the Olympic truce .
Furthermore , in the field of transport , French legislation distinguishes between short @-@ distance and long @-@ distance drivers .
The criterion of synergy and of effectiveness is , in itself , extremely dangerous , because that is how all the attacks on the principle of subsidiarity are made .
That is the approach we should be adopting .
The images from Japan are heart @-@ rending .
( EL ) Mr President , the question indirectly calls for new Community legislation .
The fate of Ukraine currently hangs in the balance , and if it swings towards democracy it will enrich the whole of Europe .
I hope the House will follow the line that has been put forward by the committee in this report .
Member of the Commission . - The free movement of workers is a fundamental principle of the EU .
But it must also be said that the representatives of the Turkish Prime Minister and the representatives of all the European countries , including the Greek representatives , were brought together on the fringe of the Florence Council , and we have started serious work to resolve the dispute .
So we must continue to assume that these tasks will primarily be undertaken by the Member States .
Mr President , I would like to talk about the last indent of paragraph 25 , which will be up for a separate vote and which I hope we will be able to delete from the report .
Ladies and gentlemen , Mr President , I myself have already been criticized in the context of this crisis for - I quote - taking a heterodox position , for Mobutophilia , and lately , for being a psychopath .
I am indeed aware of the price discrepancies between the United Kingdom and other Member States and I share the honourable Members &apos; concerns .
Firstly , the procedure for recovering misspent funds is too slow .
That is why , today , I can only hope that if the consolidated version of this regulation is adopted on Wednesday it will be implemented with the utmost stringency and the utmost transparency .
The Copenhagen Summit has shown that the EU is built on great visions and historic decisions , but , at the same time , time @-@ consuming and sometimes even ugly negotiations on milk quotas , suckler cows and all kinds of transitional arrangements .
I should like to congratulate our rapporteur on having reached an agreement with the Council on this important text , the adoption of which has been held up for too long .
I shall give you an example .
That is not true .
The people there are now trying , especially in Tunisia and Egypt , to build new countries - democratic countries where there is respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law .
The Specific Programme &apos; Cooperation &apos; , with a budget of EUR 32 500 million for the next seven years , represents 65 % of the total budget of the seventh Framework Programme , which is a significant increase on the previous Framework Programme .
Ladies and gentlemen , this debate hinges on a question of trust .
This approach is unhelpful from many standpoints , not least from the point of view of those who suffer genuine human rights abuse and whose cry is muffled by all the other competing demands .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I would like to thank Mr Langen , the rapporteur , for the excellent work he has achieved despite the short length of time available .
I believe that too much is being expected of the Member States in this area .
We need some proper indicators and markers there , which may be done by voluntary agreement , but I do think that this needs to be a wide @-@ ranging and ambitious proposal .
The economic and social objectives of the Single Market - the free movement of workers , combating social exclusion and pension portability - are something worth fighting for .
Few question the importance of children receiving physical education at school .
Most of the direct payments to agriculture go to large agri @-@ business concerns that produce food with a high chemical content rather than to family farms producing healthy food .
The agreement we came to yesterday was that we would go ahead with the debate but that my group would ask for the report to be sent back to committee for further work to be done on it in the light of the debate .
A product is not only something that we can physically touch - these days it also includes intellectual goods .
This means that there is unfair competition between the cheap tickets offered by the airlines and those offered by the railways .
After all , economic growth and low inflation provided scope for reform .
Mr President , the atmosphere is a lot more pleasant this evening .
I hope that this proposal will receive political support in the Social Affairs Council on 3 December , which would allow it to be adopted at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 9 and 10 December , so that we can have a formal tripartite social summit during the Greek Presidency .
I understand the force of what he says when he reminds us again that the internal audit activity , the examination of contracts , was a direct product of the discharge resolution drafted , in fact , by Mr Casaca himself and some of his close colleagues .
It may rather appear as if we are asking the Council and Member States for a favour .
Patents should protect innovation , rather than stifle competition .
There is insufficient equipment available , and we do not have a reliable donor database .
There is no need for an in between stage .
It entails the consolidation of relations in good faith between the EU &apos;s institutions .
to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2004
Because I disagree entirely , from both a political and a technical point of view , with any recommendation to the Council not to conclude this Agreement with the USA , I voted against consulting the Court of Justice , which I see as a disgraceful delaying tactic and a new hurdle in the way of an Agreement that is necessary to our security and freedom .
One of the problems as I see it , however , is in relation to the human rights of the various minorities within the Union , especially with regard to freedom of worship .
Since 2002 the Commission has allocated on that line more than EUR 86.2 million to NGOs as a contribution to 25 projects combating HIV / AIDS being implemented in 16 African countries .
Both my group and the majority of the committee supported the Commission in the matter of ownership unbundling .
What trilateral or bilateral cross @-@ border cultural cooperation projects has the Commission supported between the Czech Republic , Germany and Austria during the past year , and does it see any possibilities for assisting such projects on a significant scale in 2008 ?
Our standpoint is still that which we took at first reading , and I do not therefore want to respond to the small minority of radicals that has just spoken , but I would like to address the Commissioner in the words of a great German poet : more courage , Commissioner , more courage !
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs Lienemann has just painted a very drastic picture of how important water and air are to us , especially as the very source of life for human beings .
But , on the contrary , we will also be making quite massive demands .
In the latter stages of the negotiations , we mainly talked about the two key components , namely the enforcement of the regulation and the dismantling of decommissioned ships , on which two topics I should like to expand .
When it comes to fashioning a social Europe , the Scandinavian model is one of the fundamentals on which we Europeans can rely , and so it is quite utterly unacceptable that the President of the Commission should assert to this House in every one of its sittings that he defends the European Social Model and then goes on to allow his Commissioners to go about saying the very opposite .
The debate on employment policies has a European dimension that should not be overlooked .
( The sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m. )
As regards humanitarian assistance , the Commission , through ECHO , is continuing to finance programmes in support of displaced and refugee communities through international NGOs and the UN .
Member of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I wish first of all to thank the Committee on Development and its rapporteur , Mr Hutchinson , for this report which returns to a number of issues and concerns that we completely share .
These agreements , which account for 20 % of the total Community catch , have also been an incentive for the development of the local fishing industries and , insofar as they help boost economic activity and trading volume in the co @-@ signatory countries – developing countries , as a rule – they may prove to be additional valuable instruments for cooperation and dialogue with the European Union .
As the rapporteur emphasises , Europe needs an extra 700 000 researchers if the Strategy &apos;s principles are to be put into effect .
At the moment , I do not trust them .
7 .
Today , however , we are only raising the curtain ; there is still much to be done to ensure that the fruit surpasses the promise of its flowers .
The specific rule concerning unfair competition is very important for judges and lawyers .
That means that it must be open and transparent in its activities .
I should like to point out that the timing and procedures need to be right for the migration of the whole European network and for the current standard to be maintained , thus guaranteeing compatibility with future technical specifications .
It is now time for the EU to look outwards and forwards .
This worst case scenario is to be feared because the judges will not be at all independent of the States that appoint them .
In both his introduction today and in that speech he vacillates dreadfully between the position that we must not entirely rule out the prospect of membership and the view that we must not initiate it either .
( FR ) Mr President , Mr Courard , Commissioner , the principal objective of the European Union , an objective which appears in the Treaty of Lisbon , is the development of a social market economy oriented towards full employment and social progress .
This recommendation by Parliament proposes to approve the regulation offered by the Council and not to delay any further because the new regulation would simplify the administration of procedures and would guarantee the equal treatment of legally resident third @-@ country nationals in the field of social security .
As for whether the public authorities will comply promptly or whether the 8 % interest rate will act as a deterrent , I cannot hide the fact that I am somewhat doubtful as to the outcome , when I think of certain regions in my own country and other Member States that will really struggle to comply with the new rules .
There is now a sound compromise proposal before us by Parliament , also accommodating the Council .
in writing . - ( PT ) Citizens of Roma origin are often victims of discrimination in the various EU countries ; since it can take many different forms - affecting their political , economic , social or cultural rights - it fosters poverty , social exclusion and disintegration .
In view of the state of the world and the concentration of the economy , some are tempted to surrender given the lack of proposals for a realistic alternative .
They are quite wrong !
The practical difficulties posed by applying this principle should be highlighted .
What did it do in 1968 in Prague ?
We should therefore pay serious attention to this phenomenon and deal separately with the multiple reasons and causes for it .
The candidate for the Presidency of the Bank is prepared to appear before the European Parliament four times a year .
The sooner concrete results are achieved , the sooner Croatia will join the European Union .
I believe it is erroneous to take into account only the commercial aspects of sport .
I reiterate the appeal of the European Parliament for a moratorium on the use of the death penalty to be introduced in all countries of the world .
( The President cut off the speaker )
No actions have been taken , however , to stamp out corruption , to make the taxation and scrutinizing authorities more efficient , to tackle tax evasion and to ensure that VAT that is due is paid .
We welcome the request made in the report for compensation to be paid to civilian victims of an unequal conflict and for the International Criminal Court to be seized of any cases in which the parties fail to conduct genuinely independent and impartial investigations , as was requested last January by numerous Israeli human rights associations .
I just wanted to know your opinion on the setting up of a formal structure for exchange of information with regard to health professionals , in this case , care @-@ givers , who cross borders .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today marks 100 years since we first celebrated International Women &apos;s Day .
That is the wording you used and it does not at all have the same meaning , since in the latter case , the transitional regime lasts for five years .
Many do give you their support , but many are making problems .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this evening , in this session , we are concluding a lengthy piece of work and I believe that we should all consider ourselves satisfied with the results achieved .
Adjournment of the session
In 2002 , the European Union signed an agreement of this nature with Mozambique , which was seen by many as the perfect agreement , because it managed to combine cooperation and mutual interest : in the next three years the Community fleet will be able to fish in Mozambican territorial waters in return for financial compensation of around EUR four million .
In order to do so a number of criteria had to be reached , for example regarding deficit and inflation .
The arguments deployed by the Commission are fanciful , untenable and arbitrary .
It is imperative that we also address the underlying problems within the countries from which these desperate people flee .
I hope it is because you are embarrassed that you wasted so much time on it , but Parliament should be made aware of what you spent your time on in Vienna .
Mr President , the MEDA funds have been frozen for far too long .
This terminal dues problem has to be faced .
Who knows how much oil and gas we import in Europe ?
In conflict prevention and crisis management , time is of the essence .
It is even more disheartening to see how quickly tens of billions of dollars are easily found to rescue failed banks , insurance companies , fraudulent real estate agencies and obsolete auto industries , and how tens of millions of dollars in bonuses are paid to incompetents and crooks responsible for the financial debacle - and yet decades of appeals to the rich to increase foreign development assistance have been met with much resistance .
I consider the question of taxation far easier and I consider the question of European legislation on the participation of people with disabilities in the political systems of the Member States impossible .
It is up to Washington , not us , to assume responsibility for a conflict which was triggered merely to serve its interests .
What is most important : fancy fast cars and speed @-@ enthused drivers , or saving thousands of human lives ?
The question was raised as to the plans to dismantle the Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip .
The IND / DEM Group has not held any other meeting since that date .
The opposition , in spite of growing support among the people , gained only one seat .
As far as integration in concerned , let me state very briefly that integration is a vital part of migration policy , and obviously the Fund will be used for all policies geared to the social inclusion of those who respect our rules .
the Crowley report ( A4 @-@ 0088 / 97 )
You will thus have to adopt a bottom @-@ up approach if you do not want this knowledge society to amount to little more than the pursuit of profits by a number of successful and necessary new firms .
I therefore hope that the debate that takes place over the next six months will strengthen the European institutions as well as our project for the Europe of the future .
Therefore , it is essential for us now to come up with a balanced approach as to how best protect the intellectual property rights of the creators .
After the collapse of the talks in Cancún , there were some worrying signs that the United States was going to abandon the multilateral rules and force a series of bilateral deals around the globe .
I opposed the report even though it makes some good points , such as the fact that water must be for all or that we must share resources and that there must be solidarity among regions .
That is something that I too repeatedly opposed in the debate in the committee , quite simply because , as German law on immunity stands , a German public prosecutor &apos;s office simply cannot do otherwise ; it is not permitted even to open a file and commence investigations before a definite decision has been taken on the waiver of immunity .
A successful economy is not an Anglo @-@ Saxon conspiracy , but the key to our survival .
General remarks of this kind are repeated again and again , but in fact we do not have a full understanding of how the Union ’ s budget is implemented .
The BSEC is called upon to play an important role in securing peace , stability and prosperity in regions facing considerable challenges , such as the Balkans and the Caucasus , as well as in the creation of a Eurasian economic area .
Mr President , I shall not dwell on the importance of this sector for ports , maritime regions and islands in Europe , I think that the importance of this sector for tourism , employment and for the generation of economic activity is clear enough .
Let us embark on the path towards this goal .
In any case , I am sure that this saved the taxpayer some money and as for the delegation from the European Union , we were pleased with the way the conference was organised .
That is why we also call for the UN human rights office in Bogota cofinanced by the EU to be opened immediately .
When I have had the opportunity this week to report to the Bureau , which is the next body in sequence , having reported to the Conference of Presidents , I will then try to take some steps to ensure that all Members have their own appraisal of the state of the exploration as we made it .
Another valuable part of the report is that it promotes the definition of protection areas for aquifers which supply medicinal water sources .
Meanwhile , the technicians have gone back to work with , I hope , renewed enthusiasm and I note that they are progressing quite well at this moment .
America as a whole , from Canada to the Magellan Strait , is a continent in which European culture , history and life have had a great influence . The result of this influence has been hybrid societies , differing societies , which are not European but whose value systems are based on everything they have inherited from centuries of our presence throughout that enormous continent .
It has definitely helped the fight against fraud and in doing so has improved the workings of the internal market .
The risk of poverty is increased in the Union when men and women divorce , as can be seen from statistics , particularly in Germany .
Secondly , bearing in mind the importance of the contribution made by the SMEs in terms of employment , the emphasis placed on these enterprises goes well beyond the aspect of training alone .
We in the European Parliament will approve the relationship with Russia , we want close cooperation , but we shall also pay close attention to , and when necessary issue a reminder about , the reform process in Russia towards a state which operates under the rule of law , respects human rights and establishes a civil society which acts democratically .
At this point in time , we need carefully to assess what can most usefully be done .
In that respect , money for research will not be wasted , even if we never succeed in taming the actual fusion process so that more energy is produced using it than is needed to get the process started .
As always happens , it is very difficult to concentrate only on biogas - we then start a discussion on all renewable energies .
An awareness and the study of each other &apos;s history is essential so that the citizens of the countries of Europe can start to develop an awareness of the fact that they are also European citizens .
For us , the French , it is also the election of a great European , François Mitterrand , on 10 May .
11 .
This is a worrying sign that the Commission is too often a deficient administration , stricken with fraud , irregularities , even corruption .
Secondly , on the matter of liberalisation , firstly , I must stress that privatisation is not the Commission &apos;s concern .
We should respect Tunisia as our Euro @-@ Mediterranean advanced partner .
That is for the British people and our elected representatives in our House of Parliament in Westminster to decide , just as it will be for us to decide one happy day to put Messrs Blair , Brown and Cameron on trial for war crimes , because Afghanistan , just like Iraq , is a criminal war .
The case law of the European Court of Justice has taken great care when dealing with such issues in the past .
Switzerland will conform to EU financial control and audit provisions .
It is also my wish that no one in the Union will regard these new Member States as inferior , and that their sound economies and democratic institutions will continue to show robust growth .
Donor countries should pay greater heed to the government , but above all to women &apos;s organisations which are saying loud and clear that the warlords &apos; power must be cut off and the country must be reconstructed on the basis of law and democracy , because there can be no democracy if there is torture or massacres such as the one at Mazar @-@ i @-@ Sharif .
The questions that have been raised by Mr Paasilinna cannot be the subject of an initiative of the Commission based on the fundamental freedoms of the internal market , provided for in Articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty , because the purpose of those provisions is to regulate situations with a cross @-@ border element .
I believe that when we take a good look at how successful the ERASMUS programme has been , whereby university students in Europe can study in different countries , make friends in other parts of Europe , and discuss it afterwards among their friends and contacts , it is clear that it makes an essential contribution to mutual understanding in Europe .
For months , there had been no progress on the issue of the Union &apos;s use of NATO capabilities and resources .
The democracy so close to our hearts means respecting other religious persuasions as well .
We are sure that , even though this is your last speech here , your work will continue to be as positive as it has been throughout this parliamentary term , as I have witnessed .
It is particularly important that the Commission and the Member States take steps to prevent the catastrophist predictions of the Euro @-@ sceptics becoming the common view of the issue .
First of all , this is unclearly formulated .
We share Mr Vallvé &apos;s concern because jobs are actually the main priority in this proposal .
The President of the Commission has pointed out the need for a clear rapport between the composition of the Commission itself and its programme .
I hope there will still be an opportunity to have a compromise that would suit all the Member States and also the European Parliament .
Mr President , I would have kept my peace , had Mr Schulz refrained from making these comments .
So that is what it is about .
We will work with the Commission to deliver an effective and workable directive that will be of benefit to consumers and citizens throughout the European Union .
I have therefore written to Commissioner Rehn , asking him to get the Commission to mount a thorough and independent inquiry into the circumstances of these brutal killings , which should not go unpunished .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Madam President , I would like to welcome the High Representative to the European Parliament today .
They also point out that the European Union is partly responsible for destroying the environment if it helps to finance bad projects of this kind .
The Union now needs to act , and act fast , to put a stop to the irresponsibility and the impunity .
One of the largest natural fields in the world is located in Transylvania .
Judging by the current political climate in Afghanistan , it will be harder to secure Mr Kambakhsh &apos;s safe release if it appears that the Afghan authorities are bowing to international pressure .
If there has been a leak it has come from the Commission and we will certainly take this matter up with them .
Denmark , Sweden , Belgium , and the Netherlands reap the benefits of a high level of external border control .
I am shocked by the violent incidents which took place in the Camp of Gdaim Izyk and in the town of Laâyoune , as well as by the use of force on the very same day on which the third cycle of informal talks on the status of Western Sahara opened in New York .
A continual deepening of police and judicial cooperation is taking place here that , although necessary , does not take sufficient account of the issues of the degree to which the guarantees of fundamental rights are binding , of parliamentary legitimacy , and of legal and parliamentary control , and disregards the conflicts with regard to the rule of law .
. Firstly , I wish to express my support for the efforts of the Community to strengthen the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste within the EU .
In calling for change , we are merely exercising our parliamentary power of scrutiny .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , the noble objectives of the Commission &apos;s Communication on organ donation and transplantation and policy actions at EU level , as well as Mr Adamou &apos;s report , which stresses that organ donation is a gift and that it is important to respect and protect the freedom to donate or not to donate organs for transplantation , are insufficient .
While I approve the report , however , I think the European Ombudsman himself and the work he does should be more widely publicised , especially in the Member States where he is not immediately recognisable .
I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the exemplary cooperation given by both the Court of Auditors and the Commission and their active willingness to provide the information requested .
I make a number of proposals which would help to promote those modes of transport in the EU .
Is there additional need ?
In this respect we have stressed the pragmatic and decisive influence that the European Parliament has had on the content of the new treaty .
Mr Galeote Quecedo , certainly I raised the matter of this new attack , here in the Chamber at 5 p.m. yesterday , deploring it in much the same terms as you did .
in writing . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of Mr Cottigny &apos;s report on informing and consulting employees in the European Community .
We consider the ECB to be one of the world &apos;s most transparent central banks .
The Greens would like to stress first of all that we are not , as many people would have it , against fisheries agreements with third countries but we have very important conditions that we want attached to those agreements .
The common market encompasses almost 500 million consumers and an abundant variety of goods and services .
These matters should be considered on an individual basis .
( DE ) Mr President , Baroness Ashton , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by warmly congratulating my two fellow Members on their reports , which have formed the basis for a very good debate with excellent results .
Do we agree with this ?
It is clear that a large number of SMEs will continue to depend mainly on credit and loans .
This is what the report is all about .
The law must be put into practice in every country and the Commission has responsibility for monitoring the process , and making demands on Member States in that respect .
( PL ) Madam President , Mr Gloser , Commissioner , the European Union managed to retain its credibility at the recent summit in Samara .
Without added value , the compromise will be worthless .

We need a stronger Europe and a genuine partnership with the US to achieve the Millennium Development Goals .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , patents are an important factor in technological progress .

In the context of planning for the future we must ensure that goals are achieved within the economic framework of the traditional family farm .
The better the conditions provided for them to integrate as quickly as possible into the foreign education environment , the greater their chances of success in their education and in the labour market .

Subject : Improving the regulatory environment for SMEs The internal market is an ideal environment in which European undertakings can conduct business .
For my part , I am , of course , prepared to work with you in a spirit of mutual respect and loyalty , with the European project – that of our citizens – always our main priority .
The change is necessary , as our role as the UN &apos;s biggest provider of finance , one that has largely gone unnoticed , has shown .

Finally , mention should be made of the guarantee that codecision will apply in connection with future procedures .
There is no doubt that we need a legal framework that will gradually allow Europe to provide a truly European response to all these migratory problems .
The Council adopted a proposal for a legal basis for the fund to be implemented but so far not one euro has been given , and a further 2 million people have died .
The northernmost Member States have been genuinely in favour of both the Internal Market and enlargement .
The last but no less important obstacle to overcome before we relaunch the European eco @-@ label is its relationship with the numerous national systems already existing in various Member States . These are known and respected by many European citizens : for example , the Blue Angel in Germany or the White Swan in the Scandinavian countries .
Therefore , the Commission really must not beat around the bush as it has been doing .
We asked for an increase in the funding granted to the European Refugee Fund , and this was given .
The main thing is for a different agricultural policy to be introduced which serves to strengthen a rurally based economy .
As I see it , we have done a reasonable job of this .
Taking into account the difficulties related to the relevant tests required in the harmonised toy standards EN 71 : 1 for books made of cardboard and paper , the Commission will mandate CEN to establish a revised standard which covers adequate testing for children &apos;s books .
So , our agreement with South Africa , whatever the final format , will have to have a clause on the progress of development of the agreement itself to take into account closer integration in the region .
Closure of the sitting
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , giving Europeans the best training for the future , from their earliest youth , whatever their origin and level of education , above all means giving them the ability to speak languages other than their mother tongue .
For Parliament , the question is essentially : How does the Commission intend to do this ?
Current information is that Russian troops appear to have secured most , if not all , of the villages occupied by the invasion forces from Chechnya .
Concerning investment , as far as top class sport is concerned , we have launched a study on the training of young top @-@ level sportsmen and sportswomen in Europe .
We condemn this absolutely stupid and inhumane &apos; streamlining &apos; , which will mean some of the existing businesses will close , that their workers will be made redundant and unemployment will get worse , and the only purpose of this streamlining is so that surviving factories make a profit for their owners .
Therefore , the Agency must stand in the centre of a European movement striving towards better observance of fundamental rights and it must apply all the knowledge from previous experience in this process .
A related issue concerns the budgetary powers of this Parliament , where different suggestions have been tabled to increase and decrease the role of Parliament in this area .
The situation was described to us yesterday on behalf of the immigrants : it is already very serious in the Netherlands and in Germany and , in a more furtive way , in the United Kingdom , Spain and Portugal , apart from the regularizations granted in the latter two countries .
Moreover , the Commission welcomes the adoption of this legislative proposal by both the European Parliament and the Council .
The entire text has already been the subject of overall reading in the working party . It has also been examined by the Article 36 Committee and is now before the COREPER .

The crimes of the Communist regime have left a lasting negative effect on the psychology of the people of the Baltic States .
rapporteur . - ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , in all sectors of transport there has long been careful investigation of the causes of serious transport accidents .
I agreed with this document , because the Commission has informed Parliament in its proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund ( COM ( 2011 ) 0010 ) that , on the basis of applications for assistance by Poland , Slovakia , Hungary , the Czech Republic , Romania and candidate country Croatia relating to the flooding disasters of May , June and July 2010 , it proposes the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund .
Here in the European Parliament , with the reforms that we have just now finished putting into practice , we are absolutely ready , from this next parliamentary term , to answer in full for the management of everything relating to our accounts .
I welcome the reference to ‘ self @-@ regulation ’ , which does not come within the Union ’ s mandate and allows private partners to adopt common guidelines among themselves and for themselves at European level .
Therefore in order to ensure an exchange of information concerning the person making the transfer at each stage of the transfer process , we have to introduce a system which obliges the financial services suppliers to include specific and accurate information about the person making the transfer in the financial transfer documents .
It is degrading the environment , destroying the prospect of communal coexistence on the border and setting a very poor example to future Member States .
Thousands , perhaps tens of thousands of what are known as internal displaced persons , who the decades @-@ long fighting in the South had pushed into the refugee camps of the North , set off back to their former homes in the South .
in writing . - The EGAF is an important structural fund in the EU that enables us to aid workers that have been rendered unemployed as a result of the shifts in global trends .
Mr President , under the Constitution the present European Union will be abolished and in its place a new one will be established , which , according to the Constitution , reflects the will of the people and states .
We know what the consequences are for consumers , in the context of financial services , if we get the cross @-@ border regulatory regime wrong .

I should like now to refer to the financial aspects of the proposals for the reform of the common agricultural policy .
I want to make it clear that I did not mean that the national emblems of those countries in particular give me gooseflesh .
As a minimum , we can only deplore the inconsistency of European policy , in the Great Lakes region as elsewhere ; one is tempted to see this as yet another defeat for the common foreign policy , especially as regards the lack of co @-@ ordination between the Council and those Member States which are also members of the United Nations Security Council .
Seven action plans have been adopted with Israel , Jordan , Morocco , Tunisia , the Palestinian Authority , Ukraine and Moldova .
The idea is to support recent positive developments in several of these countries and to remind the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that the door will also be opened to it once it joins the movement or , to be more precise , when the conditions are right for it to join the movement .
Let us show solidarity with the Ukrainian people , but let us also ask Ukraine to come to terms with the dark pages in its history .
The positions taken by national delegations reflect the varying situation on the markets of the 27 countries .

This is quite interesting to those of us who live on the island of Ireland in terms of having our goods transported and sold .
Europe must continue to concentrate on two fundamental points .
I have always wondered why environmental grounds are always automatically thought to be more environmentally friendly , while those for the internal market are branded as being in the interests of industry .
On the one hand , it is always very easy to say that the Member States are responsible for the delay .
The Treaty of Lisbon weakened the role of the Presidency , but this role has not yet been fully delineated , and now is the last chance to do so .
But we must devote much more discussion to the responsibility incumbent on such companies .
They are evident in every town , city and street we go into across the Union , in particular the UK .
Let us compare the European social model with other situations : an example close to home was the great swindle of the totalitarian Communist experiments , which for decades deprived many Europeans of their right to freedom , for most now happily regained .
The next item is the vote on the following motions for resolutions .
I would like particularly to thank all those Members with whom I have had the privilege of working , and in whom I had complete trust , as rapporteur on the Joint Research Centre &apos;s nuclear research activities over the past few months , and Commissioner Potočnik as well .
Is the Commission ready to run the risk that , as a result , married couples &apos; existing privileges , particularly those of a financial nature , may be abolished and equality may be secured in this way ?
Since Amendment No 35 was adopted , Article 12 of the proposal has to be deleted , which of course means that the amendments tabled to that article lapse .
And it is public knowledge that laundering of the proceeds from crime is not only carried out in tax havens ; laundering also , and more importantly , goes on in the largest banks in the financial world .
The directive does not confer any comitology powers on the Commission .
To conclude I would simply remind you , Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , that this Directive concerns more than 400 000 undertakings and 10 million jobs across a broad range of industrial sectors .
Secondly , there is an objection in terms of content .
Either way , from the point of view of this Parliament , there will be a 2008 budget .
That gave Britain an opt @-@ out from the Social Chapter threatening to deny , before the welcome arrival of Tony Blair ’ s Labour Government coming to the rescue , decent social standards to the people of Britain and condemned , at French insistence , Parliament to travel in perpetuity to Strasbourg , at a cost of EUR 400 million a year and the criminal inefficiencies entailed .
This is most certainly their due .
Like ourselves , this fine , unbiddable Italy does not identify with current European Union trends .
Written declarations ( Rule 142 )
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to begin by welcoming Parliament &apos;s initiative to step up the European Union &apos;s disaster response capacity , given that , unfortunately , disasters are increasingly common and this will certainly become a fundamental challenge to our political initiative and capacity to respond rapidly .
We must realise that since our European waste policy has been a failure to date , it is far preferable to agree a solution that seems reasonable , and the European Commission must be very vigilant in ensuring that this directive is implemented properly .
This was the reasoning behind our amendment , which was unfortunately rejected .
Today , we are discussing a sector that does not receive aid from the common agricultural policy and is suffering due to increased feed prices .
However , I also regret the fact that a Commission which has done excellent work throughout its term of office should have been forced to resign .
Voting time
The committee has also expressed its clear support for the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights ought to contain rules which give citizens the right to expect good administration within the EU .
Car manufacturers must also provide information on the rate of re @-@ use , recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved within the coming years .
It is crucial too , despite the pain of recession , to confront the challenge of climate change and the problems posed by poverty .
It is not up to him how long Lech Kaczyński remains President of Poland , no matter how much he wishes it were .
We come up against these two rather simple things and get into a very complicated , legalistic argument with the Member States and the Council .
In my report , I have emphasised the fact that robust coordination of legislative and budgetary work will be required if the institutions are to operate efficiently .
Thank you .
Vets have a duty of care and will always try to treat a sick animal .
The debate is closed .
A clear call went out to take the time to sign up fair and balanced agreements in compliance with EU commitments towards African development .
We also need more adequate training for our lawyers and for our judges .
Mr President , I value the tenacity of Mr President Santer , but there is one problem - that of credibility .
This is a general objective on which we have an opportunity of moving forward .
If the financial system , responsible for reckless trading and speculation , is being held up as one of the major causes of the financial crisis , then it is right that those responsible should have to pay their share by offering the most significant economic contribution .
The rapporteur has actually somewhat diluted and adjusted the second amendment to take account of the fact that , as Commissioner Monti pointed out in the previous debate , the Standing Committee of European Doctors is an unofficial , non @-@ institutional , private body which therefore cannot be referred to .
I can guarantee that the Presidency will try to act as quickly as possible .
This is why Mr Harbour &apos;s report touched on these aspects and our colleague , Reino Paasilinna , successfully supported the European Socialists &apos; point of view , which is that the key element must be the consumer .
We need that kind of initiative in those six county areas .
Why ?
In some cases its shares are sold on the stock markets .

These weapons are scattered all over Greece .
We set , however , a rather long period to ensure that voyages in domestic waters are also covered .
Firstly , they are economic guidelines for three years , not just for one year . Secondly , they will be discussed alongside the employment guidelines .
These are serious matters with extremely practical consequences for the people who are the victims and for the European Union which is founded on anti @-@ racism and cross @-@ border solidarity .
We should let European rules and regulations apply to European companies .
For this year , then , we have applied for an additional EUR 2 billion as means of payment for the Structural Funds , as there is demand for them on the part of the Member States .
Otherwise even a minimum of legislation will frighten people off .
( Applause )
Mr President , this is the third debate on the EU @-@ Mexico agreement and , given that it is the most comprehensive agreement which the European Union has ever concluded with a third country , the principles that mark the sort of cooperation which will be viable in the future should not be thrown to the wind .
The Commissioner mentioned better education and investment in people .
Ukraine has consistently held good elections , and has a vibrant civil society and free media .
That said , I think we should start from two important considerations .
We often discuss how to encourage this very group of businesses to introduce innovations and patent their own inventions , particularly in the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy .
The option of establishing a train corridor has been put forward .
Zimbabwe is the most clear example of this .
The fact is that all of us would have liked to see something in line with our own thinking , and , as indeed one speaker said earlier on , all this is an important step forward , but we need many more of them .
It is a bit of a mess .
Let us give them enough time , let us give them the means to produce their plants themselves , let us help them build their greenhouses .
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , who did his utmost to achieve closure , because some of us in other Groups wanted to stick to the original Commission proposal , which was for EUR 165 million .
In this specific case , we must bear in mind that the starting point is partnership , whether between Member States and the EU or between regional , local and civil institutions .
We must vote against this resolution !
I would like to know if he could also understand the concern we in the Netherlands have for the safety of our citizens , if dikes are undermined by muskrats digging burrows .
I thank you , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , for the efforts that you have made in the last few hours .
This proposal for a directive is of particular importance because it sets out to regulate such a sensitive sector , seeking to harmonise standards for the conduct of clinical trials of medicinal products on human subjects .
Fourthly , our debate must include the special role which outlying regions of the European Union and island regions need to play if there is to be a balanced development of transport networks within the Union .
As I said , proving it might be difficult . However , maybe Commissioner Barnier might be able to use his good antenna to check it out and maybe help to take corrective action .
One hundred and twenty years ago there were 1.6 billion people in the world .
Infrastructure is minimal and in some localities the population has to contend with water and electricity shortages .
Even at that stage , the European Parliament noticed that one crucial factor in improving the quality of a fuel is a reduction in its sulphur content .
That is really not the case .
I am saddened that the Ladies in White are not here .
It says that the institutions and the budgetary authorities were likewise not very quick to detect a series of irregularities and that they themselves did not operate in the best and wisest way to prevent the consequences either . I am thinking , for example , of the great policy which led us to drop the famous mini @-@ budgets .
The fact that the amendment put down to that end by the Environment Committee was rejected represents a missed opportunity .
This is an area in which the usefulness of pursuing policies jointly under a Community procedure has not been demonstrated .
The President of the Council may be able to elaborate on this .
The new role of Eurocontrol and military and civil cooperation have been highlighted , but I would also like to stress the interoperability of the European air traffic control network and the issue , no less important – which you , Commissioner de Palacio , emphasised – of the certification of service providers .
What can we do to create full employment ?
Let us stop playing investments and debts off against each other , and instead stick to that to which we have committed ourselves .
It is incumbent on us to play our role within the democratic make @-@ up of the institutions of the European Union , but it is also our responsibility to ensure that we do not allow it to degenerate into domestic political discussions and false accusations with regard to ideology or &apos; who said what to whom &apos; .
It goes on to say that the ‘ pause for reflection … seems to be marked more by pause than reflection ’ .
The aim of this proposal for a regulation is to simplify and improve the existing regulatory framework for the labelling of textile products , with a view to protecting and encouraging the development and uptake of new fibres .
In saying that , I am not directly referring to the personal political commitments of all of them , but , personally , I wish you all the best , and I shall take it as read that the Commission as a whole wanted to do its best for this Europe of ours as a community , and that is what we , Commission and Parliament together , must continue to do , so warm thanks and best wishes to you all .
We welcome the fact that Mr Tindemans &apos; report also focuses on security policy , rather than the defence aspect of the development of the Union &apos;s second pillar .
We need to guarantee the principle of reciprocity in this context , as stated in the amendments tabled before Parliament , because we believe that this will avoid distortion of the market , which has already occurred in other liberalisation processes .
France is off track in its commitments , and we need to know that the presidency is going to reflect on the call to action and make the kind of commitments that are needed before 2010 .
We also aim to develop relations with the countries of the Western Balkans , so that they can join the process and accede to the European Union at a later date .
These efforts are also aimed at the implementation of political reforms and cooperation on human rights and democratisation , and are based on civil society through commitments entered into either by way of association agreements or , where necessary , as part of European neighbourhood policy .
The worst fears of many people , expressed in this Chamber , have not been realised .
All Members of the European Parliament should , as soon as possible , be subject to uniform terms and conditions .
However , talking of the interests of consumers and economic operators , the interests of the latter often prevail .
I call on you , ladies and gentlemen , to reaffirm the European Parliament ’ s support for the Directorate @-@ General for Competition and for the Commission in the trial of strength they are conducting in relation to Microsoft .
I hope that other consumer issues pending before this Parliament can also , in due course , be resolved with equal skill and constructive spirit .
Neither the Italian Presidency , nor the attitude of certain countries – who bravely defended their interests – can be blamed for this fiasco ; it was simply the result of this Convention and its outlandish constitution !
They argued that the Council would never deal with it in Vienna .
The trouble with this line of attack is that it does nothing to remove the seedbed from which terrorism springs , including the utter inequality in wealth or power that divides the world .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it was with utter disgust that we witnessed the massacres in Kalimantan , which are unprecedented in their brutality .
Among those sanctions , we are considering an oil boycott , an arms embargo and many other possibilities to make it crystal clear to the Sudanese Government that we mean business .
We need ambitious but still feasible targets and we need not be afraid to walk the path of an inevitable industrial revolution .
author . - ( PL ) Mr President , in the 21st century people are being murdered simply because they are albinos .
– Mr President , the draft constitution rightly contains the constitutionalisation of the Lisbon process , and it really was an achievement for this European Parliament to try and give the European Union a profile that combines economic reform , growth , full employment and social cohesion , and the draft treaty ’ s underlying values are also evidence of this objective .
This was the result not just of the resilient attitude of the Ukrainians , but also of the loud and clear signals sent by the European Union .
The results of the count will be announced this afternoon at 3 p.m.
It is by no means self @-@ evident that Russia must be helped .
This is the first report that I have presented to the European Parliament , and the support which I received was therefore particularly valuable .
In future , no EU citizen may suffer discrimination on any grounds whatsoever .
In the former Eastern Europe , the new Member States , the EU is pursuing a veritable asphalt policy with gigantic motorway subsidies .
This agreement was then broadly amended , and it was extended to States outside the Union .
It was a disaster in every way .
I am pleased that the EU has responded swiftly with EUR 196 million so far in assistance .
Also , as a result of the recent elections , several Mari school directors and civil servants of Mari background have lost their jobs .
As the Iranian intellectual , Akbar Ganji , explained here in Parliament , it is imperative that we avoid economic sanctions that weaken the people , and especially the Iranian middle class , which makes up the rank and file of the opposition .
The directive on cross @-@ border healthcare that is due to be put to the vote today is a revolution , and I welcome that .
This is not intended to annoy anyone , but to clarify the European position and to find a solution which would put an end to the appalling profit making at the expense of small animals .
The percentage of young people who are not in education , employment or training ranges from about 4 % in Denmark and the Netherlands to 16 to 20 % in Italy , Cyprus and Bulgaria .
This is a public debate . Even if , for various reasons , there are very few Members in the House just now , that does not mean that we are debating in camera .
So much so , incidentally , that Europe ’ s number one poultry producer , Doux , has relocated to Brazil to take advantage of cheap labour and plentiful raw materials at low prices .
This makes sense , especially at a time when - and I will use the same words as Anna Terrón in committee - this Parliament is debating the Lambert report , which will give its opinion on the status of the refugee and subsidiary protection .
The Cambodian government must uphold its obligations as a signatory to the 1951 Geneva Convention , in particular by ensuring that any repatriation is conducted on a voluntary basis , and by guaranteeing that asylum @-@ seekers arriving in Cambodia are not denied their basic right to asylum .
How it intends to solve this problem , it does not yet know , that is not yet understood .
For example , we have agreed that Member States in EMU will be obliged to submit stability programmes , demonstrating a commitment to orderly management of their public finances and to keeping their deficits below the Treaty reference value of 3 % of GDP over the course of a normal economic cycle .
The agreement on part @-@ time work is an important step forward for the establishment of a social dialogue at the European level .
With the Republic of South Africa , for example , there has been an agreement on scientific and technological cooperation for ten years .
As you are aware , we sent a military mission back in 2003 to prevent an escalation of the conflict in the East of the country , which was threatening the final negotiations in the peace process and thus the establishment of the transitional government .
This is a difficult balance .
Furthermore , it provides the basis for the global transfer which the Commission will propose next week .
Mr President , two basic ideas run through the Rocard report : the first is that the number of jobs is a constant , affected only by productivity .
So then male and female had more or less equal weight .
Rather than imposing a complicated and costly product labelling system that would be very detrimental to the sector and to timber as a material , we should increase the checks and target the supply chain that is placing the goods on the European market , in order to combat illegal logging .
But three years is not less than three years , so if the programme starts on 1 May 1998 , than it should run until 1 May 2001 , rather than 1 January 2001 .
Mr President , the first reading of the European Union ’ s 2006 budget serves as evidence that the European Parliament , which is a symbol of diversity and provides a forum for all views , even those as radical as the ones we heard a few moments ago , is capable of reaching a compromise on complex budgetary issues .
We urge the national parliaments themselves to select the person who is to represent their country in the European Commission .
In this respect I believe that EU standard setting on the basic qualifications and retraining programmes for driving examiners is a positive development .
Parallel to the sanctions and the increase of support to civil society and the democratic forces in the country , we have to encourage and facilitate people @-@ to @-@ people contacts by , for instance , waiving visa fees on an ad hoc basis .
( DE ) Mr President , human rights are a great good , one that we have to work to defend throughout the world , and , aware though I am of the sad events in Russia , there is still much for us to do at home .
This will be an indispensable instrument because it will eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy that , until now , has not only led to more money being wasted but has prevented State aid from bringing about progress and made it less suited to the purpose for which it was intended .
There are also technical improvements when it comes to catch notifications , the deduction of fees due and the procedures for taking catches on board .
It is now important for the peaceful atmosphere that reigned during the referendum to be followed by a peaceful period during which the results can be announced and the two states can undergo transformations .
It is unacceptable to impose on everyone the choice made by some Member States to privatise and open up their public services to competition .
No one doubts that either .
Our committee has also expressed some concern about abusive practices in the services sector .
Mr President , the introduction of the euro will obviously bring about change for all market players , and we are convinced that the positive effects will amply outstrip the negative ones .
Within the EU , we need to influence immigration laws and asylum policy so that reasons for persecution which are gender @-@ specific or not related to a particular state are recognised .
It is within our power to restore the marshes of Iraq .
First of all , we are awaiting calculations of the scale of the damage and then we can decide how best to use the Solidarity Fund .
I strongly support this text in its desire to see the EU &apos;s priorities in Central Asia clarified , the European projects launched in the region strengthened and their implementation accelerated .
It is prepared to act on proposals by the Commission in any area for which there is Community competence .
What you said about the need for the big countries to have a Commissioner from the majority as well as from the opposition is being misused in Germany , for example , in order to sideline the Green partner in the coalition .
The truth is that southern Albania is the stronghold of a mafia which , together with the KGB , largely controlled the pyramid investment schemes .
If there is a clear division , then there should be a free choice .
For me , the debates have been a rewarding and thought @-@ provoking experience .
Clearly , such a state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue .
– Today we are considering a truly important issue that concerns every family and every one of us : the protection of minors , our children and grandchildren , from harmful pornographic , violent and drug @-@ related Internet material .
We recognised that , whilst informing and communicating with citizens must be a priority , we have to ensure that we have the capacity , especially in terms of human resources , to manage the expenditure of the funds .
Having been presented as a way forward for the European agricultural sector , rural development is , for its part , showing a 21 % decrease in the appropriations that were allocated to it in comparison with the previous period and is paving the way for the abuse of our rural territories .
We ought , though , to decide one way or another .
We believe it is subject to strict compliance with safeguards on privacy and the protection of personal data .
The people are entitled to demonstrate within the limits of the law when they feel that the government is acting against their interests .
Mr President , Commissioner , the common position as it is now before us is the result of sound and constructive cooperation with the Commission and the Council in the spirit of codecision , but particularly thanks to the involvement of my fellow MEPs who have delivered their comments with great care , the recommendation has become a sound , well @-@ balanced and stimulating one , which Member States can now start to use .
Angelism in the face of eradication is synonymous with intellectual perversity .
I am strongly opposed to the Council ’ s course of action with regard to agricultural spending .
Its remit is to provide objective , reliable and comparable information enabling the European Union and its Member States to have a wide @-@ ranging perspective on the phenomenon of drug addiction and its consequences .
. The British Labour Members have voted in favour of the Sylla report , which serves a valuable purpose .
No one can have any political interest in doing that .
Who is passing it on to whom ?
The European Council will be called upon to provide the necessary impetus , stimulating Member States to adopt coordinated measures to ensure tangible progress towards the target investment of 3 % of GDP in research and urging industry and all parties concerned to contribute to creating European technological platforms in key competitive sectors of the Union &apos;s economy .
Mr President , on behalf of Mrs Theorin , who initiated this resolution , and my Group I would ask all Members to support it .
This having been said , the Council knows that the European Union &apos; s standpoints have a specific value added which differs from those of the Member States .
In addition , their objectives have been merged with the general objectives of EU external action .
Everyone , be they American , European or Japanese declared themselves ready and willing to save the planet .
It refers to where we are now .
Applause from certain quarters
As we have concluded our business , I declare Parliament &apos;s session adjourned .
At the beginning of December , as other Members have mentioned , two Tibetans were sentenced to death by the Kardze People &apos;s Court after a trial so rushed that doubt must be cast on its legality .
I think that greater involvement of Northern Ireland &apos;s students , teachers and professors in EU exchanges and cooperation in the ERASMUS programme would also help to bring the larger European community and populations closer .
My second reason is that we all agree that in order to properly relaunch the Lisbon Strategy it is essential to create a sense of ownership of the strategy that filters down to local levels , so that responsibility lies first and foremost with national governments and parliaments as well as with the public .
This shocking act is not an isolated matter , but the brutal operation of Islamic law in the name of a God who punishes the victim for the crime inflicted on her .
Mr President , I cherish very intense , personal memories of South Caucasus .
At the same time , the European Union reiterated its willingness to develop wider cooperation with Iran .
I would personally have no problem whatever with the production of necessary documents in the context of budgetary control , or indeed with what is demanded at the end .
Here I will refer to one or two cases and hope that my explanations of the reasons behind the Commission ’ s approach will convince the House .
Even so , names do need to be named , and then , perhaps , we might get somewhere .
Today we have before us a network of laws and guidelines which regulate and protect but which also offer loopholes and hiding places which could lead to the abuse of biotechnology .
I hope that this agreement will also contribute to the success of the Lisbon Strategy which is aiming to create a knowledge @-@ based Europe .
From the costs of telephone calls and of electricity , it appears now for the first time that dismantling monopolies is of practical value to our citizens and also entails tangible advantages .
My particular concern in the report , from the outset , was to examine these two issues in a balanced manner , as this is the only way to show people the various errors which led to the loss of the sum in question and , consequently , the opportunity to pay for D3 in advance .
It is therefore all the more incomprehensible that the Commission wants to integrate , if not conceal , an investment agreement in this agreement to give undertakings a direct right to take legal action before a special arbitration court .
All product information should be scientifically checked before it is published .
The country of origin principle allows them to assess , and then to test a foreign market .
author . - Madam President , there is no doubt that Palestinians in Gaza are suffering greatly through the gross violation of their human rights by the dreadful siege situation imposed on them by the aggressive Israeli Government actions and the tolerance shown for such actions by Western governments .
Antivirals are not a panacea , they are not a cure , they are the first line of defence and we have always said that .
There is a wrong figure there , and it may well not be as bad as that figure suggests .
But now that we are a much bigger Europe and we are a much more diverse Europe we need more investment for those new Members .
Mr President , drafting this report has proved to be a difficult job .
Not a word against the deification of the &apos; market economy &apos; or against the strengthening of repressive mechanisms , while the European Parliament is only worried about the role reserved for it .
There , too , Berlin has hidden part of the truth .
That is an enormous problem .
In Ireland we have established the Small Business Operational Programme .
Financial control on implementing the European Union budget takes place on three levels : internal control , within each institution ; external control , carried out by the European Court of Auditors ; and a discharge procedure carried out by Parliament .
In contrast to the President @-@ in @-@ Office , I wish to call for an anticyclical economic policy .
Furthermore , in September 2008 - again , for the first time - a visitor &apos;s permit was granted to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief , who concluded , I quote , &apos; individuals and communities still face a number of difficulties , although the situation has much improved since 2007 &apos; .
Furthermore , protection of victims does not mean just physical protection , but also includes the dignity of victims .
The agenda is still being finalised but I can tell you that , as things stand , the Summit will address the issue of the situation in the Middle East , following the recent , extremely disturbing developments , the situation in Iraq , with a view , not least , to the impending Donors ’ Conference , and the situation in Iran , in the context of our endeavour to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons .
One plausible reason for this may be the debate on the conditions in which calves are raised in Europe .
The conclusions we come to must not be premature and the strategy for the next stage must be properly thought through .
This is what has been done with third countries , with African , Caribbean and Pacific countries , and with the most recent agreements with the Andean Community .
The issue of health protection undoubtedly has a role to play in this proposal for a directive .
These projects will allow us to test the working methods used during joint operations and to test relations with third countries for return operations and the acquisition of travel documents .
We must , for example , fully complete the liberalisation of the internal market and work together to save energy and to develop alternative sources of energy , including atomic energy .
Aid from the structural funds can be provided within the framework of the current programmes and , if the production potential both of agriculture and of forestry has been damaged , aid can also be provided for re @-@ establishing and introducing preventive measures within the framework of what is possible in terms of rural district policy .
This created an absurd situation in which the citizens of the new Member States are not even second @-@ class citizens in the labour market .
I would commend to you , Mr President , that you should – as you remarked – stand by the ruling .
The risks of the so @-@ called &apos; live attenuated vaccines &apos; are no longer a threat , as new inactivated vaccines are now available .
This is where our Commissioner has a particular responsibility to make every effort for the sake of our jobs , and I thank him in anticipation of his doing just that .
It is , however , to be deplored that the report does not even propose to bring the advantages and rights into line with the countries where these are most favourable to pregnant women in work .
26 .
I should like to mention that our objective at this time was the guidelines .
Parliament acknowledges that all &apos; very important &apos; recommendations issued by the IAS to the Agency were adequately implemented and closed , except the recommendation on validation of accounting systems , which was downgraded to &apos; important &apos; as a result of its partial implementation ; it calls , accordingly , on the accounting officer of the Agency to describe the methodology used in the validation of its accounting system ; and it supports the idea of developing cooperation within the existing Inter @-@ Agency Accountants Network in order to come up with common requirements and develop a common methodology for validation of the accounting systems in agencies .
Question No 7 by Dirk Sterckx ( H @-@ 0384 / 02 ) :
I have to say to the Commission that , if it takes its own reports seriously , then I do not believe that those weighty problems that it has flagged in them can be resolved in five months ’ time .
I voted in favour of this resolution and in favour of the financial aid the European Union will provide for long @-@ term support , which will be managed in partnership with local authorities and the people of Haiti .
It is a good and inclusive process .
I also regret the lack of TV monitor screens in the bar and restaurant areas which should be available to members having a coffee break to follow the debates in progress and , if due to speak , to time their entries back into the chamber appropriately .
Notably , the Parliament contributed to a strengthening of the regulation in its reference to environmental concerns , complementary support and cooperation and assisting local host populations , a strong approach for targeting support programmes towards women refugees , particularly those who have been the victims of rape , and a clear provision for the upholding of the &quot; non @-@ refoulement &quot; principle , i.e. protection against forced return .
Although the answers to those questions would be almost identical in the fifteen countries of the European Union , the support provided by the different Member States varies considerably .
Mr President , I do not know why our colleagues in the Liberal Group have tabled this amendment .
The fact is , however , that this is a decision by the Court of International Trade of a foreign power - the United States - which may have the effect of restricting the Community &apos;s exports , and the Council can do one of two things : either it can take no action , or it can take action .
This scheme for the sale of Community ships , which must be at least five years old , to be reflagged as Latvian vessels , should contribute to the achievement of that balance , provided that there is careful monitoring to ensure that such boats are not subsequently reintegrated into the Community fleets and also that quotas are observed .
I also hope that the new Macedonian Government , which has been given a strong mandate , will take advantage of this new confidence in a policy that will reinforce developments towards opening negotiations .
That is what the representatives of the ACP countries and of the LDCs are asking for , and this is fully reflected in our resolution .
Let me mention that , in our 10 benchmarks , which we distributed , discussed and received more than 300 opinions about , half of these collective redress benchmarks were related not to having punitive damages compensated and not to being an expensive procedure .
We have to make it clear that the foreign ministers have taken the wrong decision and that this House continues to take a critical line on the Burmese Government .
This House has once again managed to miss out on an opportunity to give due account to a specific reality , namely that small and medium @-@ sized enterprises occupy a critical position in our economy and in Europe .
I have no doubt , and I am sure that you have no doubt , that this is a major new contribution on his part to the fight against racism and intolerance .
I am pleased with your response , but could I urge you through the Agricultural presidency to make contact with the Commission to ensure that the request is put on the agenda so that it can be dealt with during the Irish presidency .
We cannot allow political arguments to delay the enlargement .
That is why we must control trade in the so @-@ called precursors , or chemical substances used in the illicit manufacture of these types of narcotics .
The overall error rate is merely the scientifically dubious aggregation of spot checks , which , whilst interesting , are random .
I hope that the envisaged mechanism will come into force and that it will contribute to reinforcing the parties &apos; trust , as well as that the Kingdom of Morocco will be able to continue with the reforms already started by Hassan II and carried forward by Mohammed VI .
( NL ) Mr President , the profession of sports agent is one with no safeguards and little or no supervision , let alone penalties for misconduct , for example , human trafficking .
Personally , I have always advocated an approach based on product safety .
We have done this , incidentally , with regard to our conclusions on biometric information in visas and residence permits and on the visa information system ( VIS ) , and we shall continue to do so .
Not new Europe and old Europe .
The biggest item on the expenditure side is the cohesion policy , but the gaps between regions are growing instead of decreasing .
Firstly , the measures applied must be based on adequate , substantiated scientific studies , taking account of the peculiarities of each area .
Let me end by quoting what Jean Monnet said : &apos; I have always believed that Europe would be built through crises and that it would be the sum of their solutions &apos; .
It is the clear responsibility of the international community to put a stop to this terrible tragedy .
But it would seem that some have forgotten that the racial hygienists at the beginning of the century were , in their day , leading scientists , not demons .
It would be appropriate to also take this macro @-@ regional aspect into consideration in the scheduled revision of the TEN @-@ T network .
The first is the effect of our activities ; the other is a natural process .
I wish to thank all those who stressed the importance of holding our course , especially Mr Ferber , Mr Karas and many others .
There is no justification for the Commission not to answer it .
Today , these destitute men and women , who are totally neglected , form a breeding ground for terrorism , a place where terrorism thrives .
With the increasing number of extra curricular activities and school visits throughout the European Union it is imperative that there are measures adopted to ensure the safety of children .
China has trebled its spending on research and development in the last five years .
In so far as that is what it is intended to do , I am pleased with the Commission ’ s proposal to set up a globalisation fund .
As we all know , for enlargement to be successful , the European Union too has to change and we have to have policies in place to meet the new challenges of the years ahead .
The brightest young Iranians are seeing their right to higher education restricted because of their political convictions and world view .
So this assessment must be carried out , as should in future be done , before the Spring Summits , so that even better use may be made of the European Investment Bank &apos;s instruments .
So my question to the Minister is : Is the Presidency going to ensure that we get agreement at that meeting , or are you going to drop the ball ?
If the Cunha report had gone no further than this , that would still have been quite a lot .
Within the Convention , the Commission has made every endeavour - and will continue to do so - to point out intelligent ways of establishing a centre of responsibility and authority in the system for the coordination of European economic policy .
I wish our Mexican colleagues and friends a successful stay in Strasbourg .
You yourself said that Monday was a historic occasion and that is true .
We are concerned here with Mr Florenz &apos;s report , which has also been debated during this sitting .
In February 2011 , the Commission registered its 1 000th quality food name .
Should the rest of us wring our hands and leave it to them ?
I am not going to say that it is impossible for things to happen as the Commission predicts .
The problems that have arisen must be resolved through an integrated method at EU level , national level and regional level , and the funding options must be coordinated so as to cover a broad range of specific requirements .
We have a budget of less than EUR 100 billion !
At least that will not pose any translation problems , and in saying that I am addressing the booths .
This House has always supported them in the past and it seems to me a good opportunity to use this occasion to do so again .
Until then , the actions which the European Union has taken so far , even those taken unilaterally , must be continued .
The next item is the report ( A4 @-@ 0331 / 96 ) by Mr Colom i Naval , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on the Commission &apos;s programme to improve financial management ( Sound and Efficient Financial Management 2000 , SEM 2000 ) .
5 % of those who participated in methadon programmes over a period of ten years managed to overcome their addiction - this is not particularly effective .
I can therefore reassure Mr Gauzès and all the other honourable Members that we will be paying close attention to this three @-@ way balance .
But I also wear the hat of the European Parliament ’ s rapporteur for the European Neighbourhood Policy , which is now being extended to the three Caucasus republics .
As part of the compromise , too , the programme will cease at the end of 2006 .
I would suggest to the Commissioner that is not the answer .
The Council has adopted some of the constructive proposals which Parliament put forward at the first reading .
That is a matter that we need to look at and make sure that it is properly monitored .
That is not asking too much .
This seems even more essential if one bears in mind the need to abide by the constraints of the Stability and Growth Pact , particularly that of keeping budget deficits down to within 3 per cent of gross domestic product , which only leaves rather modest resources available for a counter @-@ cyclical economic policy in the individual States .
Mr Ribeiro mentioned the principle of subsidiarity , well , let us accept it .
Ladies and gentlemen , in recent times the European Union has increasingly become a driving force in the creation of a new international order .
As a result , there is the threat of companies in the new Objective 2 regions moving into the Objective 1 regions solely because they will find better conditions and support there .
- ( FR ) I should like to congratulate Mr Morillon on having stated clearly that the aim of these two reports is not to discuss Turkey &apos; s eligibility .
We need to give citizenship to immigrants and ensure that there is no repetition of the episodes we have seen in Lampedusa and Melilla .
Indeed , both parties will need to make huge efforts .
Now , on a subject as sensitive as Chechnya , we do not simply want a text written in advance by someone else to be read out .
Thus , I do not want to criticise you , Baroness Ashton .
I think that in Europe we must be more specialised in what we try to do , we must be clearer and more specific in our targeting of inspections as regards the areas we inspect , because in many Member States there is no doubt that some European money is not spent very wisely , and could be much better spent .
It is not unlikely that rivalry between the dollar and the euro may arise in Europe with the loss of jobs and a decrease in salaries for the sake of false competitiveness .
But I will ensure that the concerns raised here today are brought to the attention of the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council .
in writing . - EPLP MEPs believe that this resolution contains a number of points of merit .
On an annual basis , that represents a nominal increase of 35 % compared to the 9th European Development Fund .
The Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance is pleased to see the increase in the budget allocated to protecting tropical forests .
I will quote one example .
Let me pose a question to the Commissioner here : to what extent is the Commission discussing the Lisbon process in the context of climate change ?
In conclusion , we are living in an unprecedented situation but we are facing it .
Amendments Nos 36 and 37 are not acceptable because the delay proposed for the application of the new requirements to all holdings is too strict and would significantly raise the costs of conversion .
Now Mrs Flemming is saying that it is only a question of sentences of at least three years . But , firstly , who can ensure that all countries interpret it in that way ?
We need to be able to transfer funds and unspent margins more easily , undertake front- and back @-@ loading .
The agreement states that Europe will develop its own system for the collection and sorting of bank details .
Economic geography and history show us that when the market is unified , harmonized , extended and supplied with a single currency there are advantages for the whole , but on the other hand there is also a strong tendency for already existing geographical centres and economic groups to be strengthened , to the detriment of the most peripheral and outlying regions .
So when we examine media concentration we should look at its impact at every level .
Cutting off internet access is a disproportionate measure in view of the objectives .
The European Parliament has just adopted several amendments to the Commission proposal , but in our opinion these are insufficient to straighten something which was born crooked .
However , in my opinion , it does not provide clear , decisive and positive answers to the important questions , such as whether the EU will be able to stand on its own feet in the long term or whether it will maintain its very close links to NATO and , therefore , will hand over its foreign policy responsibilities to the USA .
Many of them no longer live and those who do are thankful that the European Parliament has not forgotten .
Firstly , because Cambodia is one of the poorest countries on the planet and since its trading relations are largely in deficit , only vigorous support on the part of the international community can curb and reverse the process of pauperization which this country is going through .
Please be assured that we remain entirely at your disposal at all times .
Secondly , the map of that state shall be redrawn along its 1967 borders . The Security Council shall then give both the Israeli state and the Palestinian state two , three or four months to disarm and to withdraw from Palestinian territory all colonists living outside Israel ’ s 1967 borders .
By voting in favour of Amendment 3 , we are not deleting the part of the sentence in paragraph 13 that states that an exception in the field of services must be made of the health care , education and audiovisual sectors .
By virtue of this communication , Parliament as an institution deems that all the proposals listed in the communication for which the Treaty of Lisbon granted it competence have been resubmitted to Parliament .
Madam President , first of all , I , too , would like to welcome Commissioner Füle to this House .
The own @-@ initiative report by Mrs Gebhardt enables us to assess the implementation of the Services Directive , the three @-@ year period for the implementation of which came to an end on 28 December 2009 , this highly important directive having entered into force in December 2006 .
What happened was that national responses differed greatly , thus creating asymmetric shocks .
The Slovaks appreciate the risks , but are eager for this further chance .
Thus the proposals presented in this own @-@ initiative report by Mr Salafranca , whom we congratulate on his excellent work , deserve all our support . Not only because they explain and list practically all the aspects that have to be taken into consideration in a joint strategy to intensify EU @-@ Latin American relations , but they also deserve our support because they come at just the right time , prior to the preparations for the second Heads of State and Government Summit to be held next May .
To insist on forcing certain countries to make impossible repayments renders development aid , as well as economic reforms , unviable .
Russia and the Union share a common security environment and a high degree of mutual interdependence , so we are right to seek to make our joint borders more secure and our shared hemisphere more safe .
This means we face an ongoing imbalance of payments , which , moreover , will prevent true convergence .
The honourable Member &apos; s question thus does not fall within the area of responsibility of the Council but of that of the conference of representatives of Member State governments .
Transport is also a decisive issue when it comes to competition .
Therefore , and also for other reasons , I think it is wise to stop this in 2010 .
My second concern applies to Article 53 in the classical directive .
This EU policy , though , shows too little in the way of structure .
I wish them luck and I commend what they are offering .
I do not know whether any of you have seen the algal bloom in this large , previously healthy , inland sea .
There are not many amendments and I can see no reason at all for delaying any further this report .
We are now three months away from the end of our term of office , and I should like to ask you once again when the new premises will be completed .
The debate is closed
Parliament will be monitoring the developments closely .
Consequently , research and development in the field of alternative energy sources is conducted and funded within the framework of the framework programme .
We are also critical of comments in media and governmental circles in other states which exploit the legitimate protests of the Iranian citizens .
So we are not starting from scratch .
Sensitive data can only be processed in exceptional cases , in cases of public interest ; they are subject to suitable safeguards , and those suitable safeguards have to be provided by the country concerned .
Of course , one can listen to the experts on a small part of the subject , but the fact remains that we , as Members of Parliament , must take initiatives .
I am very pleased that the Commissioner supports the action plan and sees opportunities for the EU to support Libya in this way so that better care might be obtained in future for those infected with HIV .
I would thank all my fellow MEPs for their splendid cooperation but , above all , the shadow rapporteur , Karin Jöns , for her constant readiness to engage in discussion .
Closure of the sitting
What would have been a real political event in my country is if I had kept quiet !
I cannot conceive either how one could ever envisage a conflict between the right of association or the right of assembly and the free movement of goods .
I welcome the positive and pragmatic spirit of your speeches since your nomination , and I appreciate the tone that you want to set in the European Council , but I expect you and the Council of Ministers to be aware that with the Treaty of Lisbon , your relations with us , the MEPs , have changed .
Please do not forget that the European Commission is , by nature , the embodiment , the consequence and the summary of everything good and bad in the history of European integration .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Trentin report surely lays the initial bases for major future decisions on economic policy .
I voted in favour of the text presented by Mrs Fraga Estévez , to whom I should like to express my appreciation for the work carried out .
Indeed , I feel that the crisis situation brought on by the Commission itself , with the support of the Socialist Group , demands a vote of no confidence in order to safeguard the institution .
I also like the proposal - though perhaps it is not enough - that some of the catch should compulsorily be landed in Guinea for the food supply of the Guinean population .
This interpretation has proved to be fallacious and shortsighted .
In paragraph 3 the intention is expressed that the Union be brought closer to its citizens .
After the directive was discussed in the Commission , I recently asked the Commissioner about non @-@ EU drivers driving within the EU and making use of the way people , drivers , in particular , are inspected during the technical inspections of cars .
For some time now the European Union has been working to develop special cooperative relations with the countries on the African and Asian shores of the Mediterranean Sea .
One effect , for example , would be the omission of the Atlantic routes .
Our policy on Russia has failed badly .
It touches more of a raw nerve with me personally when we debate the subject of the Western Balkans and , in particular , the problems of Albania and the progress which allows the European Union to waive visa requirements for citizens travelling within the EU .
We trust in the evaluation that the European Commission has carried out and can therefore approve the present step .
It is vital to build mutual confidence , both on the part of the USA and Europe and on the part of Iran .
However , you should definitely use our critical solidarity and our questions for further development .
It is months since Parliament gave you the job of investigating what action we can take , including in respect of a financial transaction tax ; we gave you the job here in this House .
I am pleased that the &apos; ERASMUS for journalists &apos; programme is finally on the agenda and that &apos; ERASMUS for young entrepreneurs &apos; is successfully operating .
It is important that the second instrument allows for this assistance to be given irrespective of the consent of the governments of third countries and other public authorities .
In parallel , the Commission intends to support the organisation of a forum for Mediterranean coastguards throughout the region .
That is why we should greet civilised globalisation with open arms in this sector too and harness it for the benefit of our citizens .
We on the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport hope that the current applicant countries will take full advantage of the opportunities the programme offers .
Secondly : the quality of the work .
This is exactly what is happening at the moment .
The report has also been successful in setting out the best way forward .
Let me turn now to our neighbours outside the enlarged EU .
It is not acceptable , as the Commission proposes , to allow the commitments to proliferate to 1.27 % of gross national income .
Mr President , Kashgar is a city of three and a half million people , a bit smaller than the population of the entire island of Ireland .
There may be some disagreement as to how we go about this , but that is democracy and it is the right way to address such important matters .
The Commission very largely shares the concerns you have expressed in your report and in the motion for a resolution before us this afternoon .
It is vitally important for the House to support this report . That will send a clear message to the Council of Ministers , namely that Parliament is in favour of retaining these particular sectors that generate so many jobs in disadvantaged areas .
Mr President , I took part in the work at Valencia and would like to draw your attention and the attention of this House to a couple of - strong - impressions I received there : firstly , confirmation that there cannot be a future of peace and stability , prosperity and economic growth in Europe if the Mediterranean area continues to experience the present conflict ; secondly , I do not want to go against the general feeling but , for the first time , I had the impression , which was subsequently confirmed during the bilateral meetings , that the Arab world and the southern shore of the Mediterranean see Europe and the European Union as the only interlocutor that can possibly help them with their problems , the only interlocutor that can live alongside their problems and resolve them .
Mr President , exchanges are the very best means of building Europe and bringing together its various parts .
But what we must remember is that , whatever the current political situation in Cambodia , this is the first election to be called by Cambodia : it is not an internationally enforced initiative but one that came from Cambodia itself .
Yasser Arafat is a viable peace partner for Israel and he commands the support not only of his people , but of the broader international community .
Central to this are the links with these parliaments that transit through the EDF and financing .
What kind of a Parliament is this ?
That is exactly why judgments on State aid lie in the hands of the Commission - a decision backed by all the Member States .
That process , thanks to the pre @-@ accession strategy which has been put in place , already makes the applicant countries part of our common family .
Since it is important , I would also like to mention another of the requests included in the report : that relating to the continuity of the system for producers &apos; organisations , with a view to maintaining the concentration of the Community produce , which has been one of the main successes of the COM in bananas .
Twenty million tonnes of unwanted catches are being thrown back .
To succeed as the most progressive combination of States , we must ensure that our institutions are fully democratic and accountable and that the individual and collective rights of all are guaranteed and defended .
In this sense , I would like to declare my satisfaction at the interventions of both the Council and the Commission .
This has become all the more important as a result of the high levels of bee mortality in many regions , which have given rise to justified concerns about whether there are enough bees and beekeepers to meet our needs .
I voted for the Martens report for the following reasons :
This proposal is part of the Union &apos;s legislative efforts towards establishing a European asylum system .
13 .
Finally , I should like to urge the Commission to reduce the time limit for the transport of live cattle from 30 hours to a maximum of 4 hours .
We are primarily concerned with the fact that the US has used a &apos; divide and conquer &apos; strategy , apparently with impunity .
The coordinator of the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats in the Committee on Transport and Tourism , Georg Jarzembowski , makes the following statement , on behalf of the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , in relation to the meeting of the ICAO :
We have been very successful .
Only 7 % of the corrections made in the 1991 budget are individual corrections . The rest are &apos; standard &apos; corrections , i.e. the Commission estimates or , more correctly , guesses what sums or what percentages are to be recovered .
Seldom has the gulf between the political elite and the people on EU issues been seen so clearly .
As you may know , last Monday the Council also discussed the situation in Sudan and we are seriously concerned about the deterioration of the security and humanitarian situation in Darfur .
Are there any comments ?
We therefore ask the Commission to pay special attention to the issue of maritime and island cooperation when zone planning next comes up for review .
Furthermore , in a situation that is as serious as the current one , it does not criticise Israel &apos;s violation of the UN resolutions , the end of the occupation , the illegal settlements , the segregation wall , the murders , the detentions , the innumerable humiliations inflicted on the Palestinian people , or even its inalienable right to a state , with the 1967 borders , with its capital in East Jerusalem .
As is often the case with the web , the picture is one of stark contrasts .
It is clear from the messages we receive on a daily basis that we can no longer satisfy our requirements by borrowing against the future of our children and future generations .
I am confident that the will is there on the part of both the Council and Parliament to make that possible and , against this background , the Council will now undertake a detailed examination of Parliament &apos;s proposals on all four of these instruments .
Am I saying this in order in some way to excuse what is happening in the Middle East ?
Together with my colleagues , we have invited Member States to provide Japan and the affected regions with all necessary support , including humanitarian , technical and financial support , while praising the decision to activate the Civil Protection Mechanism immediately to coordinate emergency aid .
I also share the concern expressed in the motion for a resolution regarding returning regional policy to national control , given that some of the economically stronger Member States are arguing that a reduction in Structural Funds expenditure should be offset by greater tolerance with regard to national aid .
Mr President , I would just like to say that I support Amendment No 48 , although you may have been informed otherwise in another context .
I visited today Parliament &apos;s web @-@ site . On the positive side I discovered , for example , that the report of the Committee of Inquiry on transit fraud that was presented this morning is already available on the Internet in five languages : English , Dutch , Swedish , French and German - very positive .
This too is confirmation of the difficulties and is a further indication of the problems encountered by the reconstruction bodies in the Balkans .
The EU is still a very limited global actor ; its role in the UN system and in all multilateral organisations does not match its democratic , economic and cultural weight .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , many thanks for this debate .
Under the draft report , Member States could not only continue to impose all current administrative burdens on companies , but add new ones .
The European Parliament cannot be involved in foreign policy as it is a branch of the budgetary authority .
Not content with single legal frameworks , tax harmonisation and the rest , the EU apparently wants to control nature .
Similarly , such an underlying budget balance would discourage finance ministers from fiscal easing in upturns , merely on account of cyclically buoyant revenue .
It is , in fact , pointless to adopt a joint resolution full of good principles , fine words and indignation if , for economic and commercial reasons , maybe , we then allow the supreme Chinese authorities to be welcomed with the highest honours by our ministers or the mayors of the various European capitals , as is actually going to happen tomorrow in Rome , when Mr Rutelli , who is Mayor of Rome as well as a Member of the European Parliament , will officially receive the Chinese Prime Minister or , at any rate , a delegation .
We can finally free the hands of the Iranian democratic opposition , the National Council of Resistance , to get rid of this inhuman dictatorship once and for all .
Mr President , I am going to divide my speech into two parts , because we are concerned today with two different aspects of economic policy . The first concerns the transition to the single currency and the second the introduction and what we hope will be the definitive establishment of the euro as the single European currency .
Here , that means coal , nuclear power , gas and so on . Just think if we were to make the same effort with renewable energy sources as with fusion power .
The main question that arises is whether it can be implemented , as much now needs to be done in order to achieve what the document claims is essential , bearing in mind the political direction that the European Union has been taking .
Certainly care @-@ giving is one of those .
Some have seen this as boring , but I am convinced that it is a necessary approach if the working method of a rotating presidency is to survive in the future .
All these goals are addressed by the Parliament ’ s report and there is a broad meeting of minds with the Commission ’ s own communication on the subject .
We must hope that it stays that way , but we cannot be complacent .
This is unfair , and I call for a review as a mater of urgency .
The year 2009 was election year , after which we had new statutes for assistants as well as Members .
Today &apos;s resolution is intended as a practical response to the alarming phenomenon of Community fraud .
( DE ) I have two short supplementary questions .
I hope that what you announced will come to fruition .
This operation will not suffice as it stands : if the rule of law and the legal certainties are to make proper headway in this Union , they must be defined now .
If you look at why Ireland is divided , it is because the successful people were given small pieces of land .
The former continues to be one of the European Union &apos;s top priorities for its external relations .
What is more , the red carpet is laid out for some of those dictators in certain European capitals .
Now that ground forces have been attacked , I think that there is good reason to question whether this nofly zone was created for that .
In the interests of public health and of beef as a safe product these investigations must not , however , be an excuse for delaying tactics in the handling of the BSE affair , behind which the Commission can take refuge .
In connection with this , the accent on opening the market to services is very important for both sides .
At a time when we are witnessing growing concern about the maintenance of fish stocks and when various recovery plans are being set up in areas devastated by overfishing , the sustainable fishing practised in those archipelagos deserves that we should all encourage it and adopt a position to support and safeguard it .
At the end of November , at his meeting with Ukrainian journalists , Mr Lukachenka stated that , &apos; this opposition sneaks abroad to call for the application of economic sanctions against the country and is then happy that gas prices are going to rise tomorrow &apos; .
It is my guess that , this year , it will be issues of principle which dominate the budget debate more than individual budget items , issues which will feature increasingly in the debate in the coming years .
To show an increase well below inflation would earn some badly needed legitimacy for Parliament in the eyes of European citizens .
( Loud applause ) It is in that spirit that I now welcome you on behalf of the European Parliament .
The agenda was approved in Strasbourg .
We want to anchor these objectives in the national reform programmes - and I have heard Mr Barroso talk about this - and we should bring forward proposals to that effect .
It would , for example , be absurd if ferries operating in the internal waters of Finland , with its thousands of lakes , had to endure thorough security checks if there were no particular threats to security anyway .
The EU must support all efforts made leading to the democratisation of this regime and an improvement in the lives of its population .
This problem has not been solved even by this report .
This budget will probably be the last to be drafted for a Union of 15 Member States .
The Commission perhaps reacted somewhat hastily in the wake of the BSE crisis , and now we are into brinkmanship again .
The European Asylum Support Office must , in 2010 , become a fair , genuine and egalitarian office , which shares out the responsibility in a way that ensures solidarity and which offers international or subsidiary protection going forward .
The first protocol with Madagascar was concluded in 1986 and this protocol is the fifth .
Madam President , I also supported this vote .
Across the European Union there are in fact some 60 million school pupils and 11 million students .
In conclusion , my group will look with interest at the conclusion of the macroeconomic dialogue .
Paragraph 54 of the proposed report states that the EU will develop close links with Russia through the partnership and cooperation agreement , but also emphasizes that Russia cannot be a Member State in view of its size and its Euro @-@ Asian interests , and in view of the EU &apos;s highly integrated nature .
These boats were carrying people from North and sub @-@ Saharan Africa .
Parliament ought to support you on this .
The instructions must contain information on the potential toxicity of the substances and their interaction with food , drink or other medicinal products .
Well , it is high time to be doing what we are doing in this area .
Those equal rights mean access to financial support as well ; access to health care , access to culture and leisure - including sporting activities , equality before the law and the right to justice .
Last year , 2.6 million people died of AIDS in Africa .
Could we have a reserve list so that all this money is used in the event of those who have been allocated at the moment not being in a position to draw it down ?
Dismantling work is also often carried out in contravention of local legislation and against the wishes of the Ministries of Social Affairs and the Environment .
In addition , these workers are exposed to health and safety risks and have few opportunities for professional development .
In this area , we must make genuine efforts to meet the OSPAR objectives as well and to avoid what is an incalculably serious risk to health and the environment .
We think this is a very good starting point , but it should not end there .
Disinterest .
I would like to say that the Commission is aware that Parliament is concerned that this proposal might lead to discrimination against certain transport contractors , or lorries from certain countries or even certain makes of vehicle , and that the intention of the principal recommendation of the rapporteur is for the fines imposed on operators by the Member States to be harmonised as a condition of application of the directive .
The Committee on Budgets approved Mrs Dührkop &apos;s report on the ad hoc procedure at the same time as it was confirming the value of the Tillich / Mulder procedure we introduced last year .
We should focus as soon as possible on combating the diseases and parasites to which bees are subject .
The committee report on the programme to finance Prevention , Preparedness and Consequence Management of Terrorism goes even further than the Commission proposal for a decision , by adding to the objectives of the programme the protection of critical infrastructures and &apos; continuity of public action &apos; .
Finally , we wholeheartedly welcome this action programme and we hope that it will promote greater knowledge and better prevention .
Firstly , as I recall , this Commission pledged , when it came to office , to carry out reforms and equip the European Union and the European Commission with the capacity to act for the future and make them less vulnerable to fraud .
Visca Catalunya lliure ! &#91; Long live a free Catalonia ! &#93;
Many people are , however , the victims of small arms and light weapons , including in conflicts such as the present one in Congo .
Article 138a of the Maastricht Treaty is more or less a dead letter .
Another of the improvements introduced refers to the need to guarantee that information about calls for proposals is accessible through other electronic media , besides the Official Journal , and in all languages .
Having got my concerns off my chest , I should now like to provide a brief outline of what happened at the PPE @-@ DE Group &apos;s hearing last Thursday , where the Commission &apos;s attitude was very positive .
I am in favour of green growth , of viable growth , but I am not in favour of the deindustrialisation of Europe .
- ( BG ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the problem of the use of waste oils containing polychlorinated biphenyls at a food waste recycling plant again has posed the question of the need for guaranteeing food safety in the European Union .
What has once become law becomes almost impossible to change .
In theory , we are agreed , of course , that these duty @-@ free zones must be abolished , but on the other hand , the European Union and the Council in the vanguard , with the European Commission in the rear , have not been able to resolve a number of tax issues .
I am grateful to the author of the report , who has succeeded in presenting this matter in a comprehensive manner , and all members of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group , including myself , are fully supporting it .
We are fully committed to assisting the Bolivian authorities during the period of transition .
It is crucial that the negotiations , as well as the text of the agreement itself , mirror values which are dear to us , such as the rule of law .
I take the very same approach where waste @-@ burning reactors are concerned .
You can bring an end to the insecurity and the doubt .
Social economy is increasingly becoming an important actor at local and regional levels and has now , more than ever - due to the serious impacts of the financial crisis - a major role to play in European social and economic development .
Economics is not an exact science . It is a science full of value judgments , and , before we finish with the technical aspects , we would like you to tell us which of the values out of those that we defend are furthered by the economy .
We would like them to know that the European Parliament will be doing its utmost to ensure that FRONTEX is given all the means necessary to carry out its duties .
This points to a spectrum of political views within the European Union .
I do not want to discuss that at length now , maybe next time I shall say more .
In other words , by implementing restrictive laws , Member States have not succeeded in reducing the overall number of entrants ; they have simply reduced the number of legal immigrants while increasing the numbers of illegal immigrants by declaring them illegal .
One of the key priorities in policy terms in promoting gender equality is granting access for girls and women to education , including physical education .
And the Council also accepts the amendments ?
Continued assistance and support at European level are also needed .
Finally it should be noted that the Green Paper has taken up many of the suggestions from the European Parliament in the last few years .
But we must also acknowledge the fact that the Belgian Government assumed its responsibilities following the death of Semira Adamu and congratulate the Belgian Government on seeking to adapt its policy and render it more humane .
When I was last in Sarajevo earlier this year the Foreign Minister of Bosnia said : &apos; Nobody won the war , we all lost the war &apos; .
Such is the progress that both the nation @-@ states and the European institutions are engaged in systematically demolishing .
And , secondly , the Council has failed to provide the citizens of the Union with a clear and honest decision as to which are , in that case , the priority projects that are soon to be launched .
The political agreement at the last Justice and Home Affairs Council on the proposal on laying down minimum standards for the reception of applicants for asylum in the Member States signified the start of much @-@ needed movement in this direction .
The framework for this report is Article 349 of the Treaty of Lisbon , in which there is provision for aid for the outermost regions to overcome permanent difficulties resulting from their geographic situation , topography and climate .
I voted in favour of this report because , although it concerns important environmental issues such as energy sources and climate change and economic issues such as the durability of uncompetitive production units in the economy , at a time of economic and social crisis , it is important to stand up for the social issues .
Mr President , some of the amendments you ruled inadmissible were also ruled inadmissible by the Chair of the Committee on the Environment , Public health and Food Safety under the recast procedures .
A key aim of the Union is that the workings of the internal market should remain untarnished .
In the early stages of the outbreak of SARS in Asia , I understand that the Taiwanese authorities could get very little information from the Chinese , which allowed the virus to spread rapidly across the region .
Do you wish , therefore , to respond now to the statements made by the three speakers ?
A balance has not been struck .
Mr President , I do not have the time to delve into the possible differences between the text of the reports and the personal views of each of the rapporteurs . I will therefore focus my comments on the Commission &apos;s statement and on the contribution of the Commissioner , and will offer both my strong support .
The turmoil in the financial markets continues and we urgently need to find a solution to the debt crisis in several countries .
I also have certain reservations concerning the creation of a European Coastguard , since this is the prerogative of the Member @-@ States , without prejudice to very close intergovernmental cooperation or to Community responsibility regarding equipment and modern and effective measures .
Your participation in the European Parliament , however , will depend on having an active approach , and to this end the experience acquired by the ten new Member States over the previous period may prove helpful .
However , what is also important is to see how stability can be achieved in these countries .
It is very difficult to explain to the public , to the ordinary people , that the European Parliament could not give an opinion on modifications to be introduced into the European Constitutional Charter .
This is a slap in the face for every voter and a slap in the face for Europe &apos;s credibility .
I will conclude by emphasising that it is our job to ensure that the products circulating on the European market are safe for the most vulnerable consumers , especially children , the elderly and the disabled .
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Charter of the International Labour Organisation are our benchmarks .
Even though I well understand Mr Schulz &apos;s initial instinctive head @-@ shaking , I would like in this case to quote a voice from outside on this .
There is agreement on the need to improve enforcement of road safety laws , no matter what other changes we make .
The practice often consists of asking for the quorum and then leaving the chamber .
I wish sincerely to thank the Italian Foreign Minister , Mr Frattini , and the Council Presidency for that answer .
A basic canon of rules will then apply to all audiovisual content , whatever the means by which it is distributed , including television and the Internet .
If the latter solution is chosen , the developing country which will be responsible for supplying the generic medicines in question will , by necessity , benefit from doing so .
1 .
Generally speaking , I am fairly sceptical about sanctions .
Meanwhile , the families of the missing persons are still living in uncertainty as to the fate of their relatives .
The Committee on Legal Affairs introduced three compromise amendments tabled by several colleagues to the effect that these additional publication requirements may be permitted if they are well @-@ grounded , but we put them into recitals - they are not in the articles .
It is too ridiculous for words .
It seems that the choice with regard to genetic modification is now between maintaining the old regulation , which is poor , but which does at least include a moratorium , and a new regulation , which is somewhat better but will abolish the moratorium .
In any case , it involves a resolution put forward by a majority in our House and , as already mentioned , adopted before the Council and the Commission are in a position to put forward some kind of common text for discussion .
The euro has had a successful birth and is established as a world currency but it is still an infant .
It is now more important than ever to set up a civil protection agency , Commissioner , after the unfortunate experience of recent years when so @-@ called Community cooperation has proved worthless and ineffective , if not downright harmful .
However , the importance of radio , particularly in minority language areas , should not be underestimated .
At its first reading , the Committee on Budgets decided to enter a reserve for humanitarian aid .
Our aim is to have it draw on the ideas and experience of the many , not the few .
Mr President , I just want to say to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that was not the basis on which the Committee of Inquiry was set up .
You may be wondering why one person or another has not been called .
Terrorism today , however , is reaching particularly serious levels in many Third World countries , and is also spreading to Europe .
It is a very important element of Parliament &apos;s reflection on inter @-@ modality , and it is in this direction that European deputies must continue their efforts to promote an increasingly intermodal form of transport .
It is extremely difficult to bring peace to Chechnya when certain powerful groups are trying to bring about its secession from Russia .
The rapporteur , Mrs Hennis @-@ Plasschaert , acknowledged the spirit of cooperation she could see in the Council - for which I am very grateful - and also in the Commission .
There is no excuse for Hamas rocket attacks , but nor for the use of dense inert metal explosives to maim civilians .
The Northwest Passage is an ideal way to save time , money and fuel and benefit the environment .
To be quite clear about this , the European car industry must now make efforts across a broad front to bring the types of cars onto the market which we need at the start of the 21st century , in other words , energy @-@ efficient cars with low fuel consumption , which make careful use of resources .
This will also help us to decide whether there is acceptance of the necessary enlargement of the European Union , which we all want . But we must also send out a clear signal that all who are currently disadvantaged and who want to contribute their resources will have the opportunity to do so .
I welcome Commissioner Verheugen &apos;s plans in relation to Bulgaria and Romania , but we must also send out a message to Romania that it has to get its act together , otherwise it will seriously fall behind schedule .
Finally , I turn to the promise that there will be compensation through accompanying measures for any losses which are inflicted on the fisheries sector .
Then we come to Amendment No 7 .
We have gained a piece of Europe , but we have not resolved the crisis of confidence among Europe &apos;s citizens .
I support the resolution calling for effective and coordinated humanitarian efforts from the EU , to ensure Haiti receives long @-@ term assistance and reconstruction .
The Committee on Civil Liberties &apos; recommendation , therefore , like that of the Committee on Budgetary Control , is that discharge be granted .
It is therefore currently far too easy to artificially set up a legal entity , sometimes with a single partner or shareholder , or to invent financial revenue that is not strictly interest in order to avoid tax .
We can do no other than congratulate him .
The achievements until now have been impressive but we need , more than ever in this period of exit from the crisis , to promote and defend European values and indeed , above all , to tap all the potential that is now created by the Lisbon Treaty .
One of my points has already been raised by the rapporteur .
We are not prejudging what will happen after 2013 .
Indeed , in his introductory statement , the President said that he is considering establishing an independent authority under his own responsibility for screening impact assessments .
Instead of ten directives , there is going to be just one new one .
Madam President , this is a truly historic event : the first modification of the 1976 Act .
After all , since 8.30 this morning , we have been deprived of the other case , to the great regret of our colleagues in the PPE @-@ DE , so I am told .
No to the public sector and no to a Europe which , if it did all this - because only Europe can do all this - would be a federalist Europe .

I wish to emphasize that it does not impose new capital requirements on insurance undertakings .
These aims should be thought of as progressive steps to take rather than as levels to attain .

I did so because local authorities in regions play a vital role in implementing European law .
Of course , in view of the strike announcement , I will contact him again , and ask him to take the necessary special measures .
Mr President , it all depends on what the honourable Member understands by the term guarantee .
We have recently seen , for example , textiles , footwear , furniture , construction and ceramics in this kind of disadvantageous situation .
I also agree with his view that it would be better to start quickly on the basis of a woefully inadequate result than of no result at all .
This is European progress that cannot be overestimated .
However , as other Members pointed out before me , nor can it be accomplished if there is no intelligent driver who understands the rules of the road and has adequate technical knowledge .
The same man with whom one gets on well in private ...
It must be a record that all the reports on this important issue are by women Members .
After all , the Court of Auditors has been issuing negative Statements of Assurance for the past 11 years , and this is something that the European public will no longer accept from us .

Does the Commission know whether Fisheries Commissioner Franz Fischler knows what &apos; pescaíto frito &apos; ( fried fish typical of Andalucia ) is ?
Another focus area in this report is the promotion of the SOLVIT network , which I personally consider to be of paramount importance , and I believe that all of you will concur with me on this .
I want to make it clear that I think the Heads of Government who are publicly backing the European project deserve credit for coming here and saying that , whatever difficulties they face , they are standing up for Europe .
In my capacity as President @-@ in @-@ Office of the European Union , I should like to roundly condemn these disgusting actions , to express my profound sorrow for the victims and their families , to express the wish for ways to be found to break this tragic form of political intervention and dispense justice and to emphasise the urgent need for us to achieve conditions of stability , security and confidence ; for us to impose the policy against blind violence and fanaticism .
Until that criminal activity is stopped definitively and the iron grip that the Republican movement exercises on various parts of Northern Ireland is ended , there is little possibility that ordinary citizens can hope to have their human rights vindicated .
Maoist rebels have engaged in violent confrontations in Nepal with the state army causing thousands of deaths .
And we also have a very strong proposal to put to the European Commission asking it to begin an interinstitutional enquiry , with the help of scientific committees , to determine if tobacco companies incorporate additives in tobacco to increase the addiction to nicotine .
When South Africa , after a long , dark period of apartheid , achieved a very honourable return to democracy the Western World rang with laudatory declarations and promises for the future of the country .
I would hope that , after this debate , the House will give it its full support .
I hope that the summit this week takes its courage in its hands , approves this Statute and approves the outcome of the Convention .
The Nepalese Government , however , acts in violation of national and international law by handing Tibetans over to China .
We are aware of the Commission &apos;s problems , but we are also aware that the only way for us to progress is by supporting the Commission .
I strongly appeal to all our fellow MEPs not only to devote fine words to Lisbon but also actually to take action where they can , and this is a good example .
B5 @-@ 0079 / 2001 by Mr Wurtz , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group , on the earthquake in El Salvador .
If the Danish proposals were to be implemented , those who put unsafe vessels on our seas would think twice .
The point is no doubt to set a precedent for , or even to reinforce the idea of , referring to the multilateral surveillance procedure under Article 99 of the Treaty of Amsterdam , so that it can be extended to other Member States in the future .
That is why I am delighted that we have widened this resolution , even though we were unable to change the title ; I would not like us to think that we are linking any country or organisation with these attacks .
I am only able to support Amendment No 5 as a supplement to Paragraph 30 .
On my own behalf , I should first of all like to thank Mr Bowis for letting me go first , because I am having to receive a visitors &apos; group , a choir , that will be opening the Dutch week shortly .
Finally , establishing a single market at the service of all citizens : this , as you know , is something I feel very strongly about , despite not being an MEP , and questions such as the transferability of supplementary pensions , pointed out by Mr Boogerd @-@ Quaak , are important .
Thus , for example , the allocation of external costs became voluntary , rather than compulsory .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my compliments to Mrs Schaldemose for the constructive and fruitful cooperation we have had .
At an earlier date the European Commission , building on the experience from earlier enlargement processes , already committed itself , where possible , to inform Parliament as closely , as comprehensively and as early as possible , both on the preparation process and on the state of discussions with countries with which we are actively negotiating .
The European Commission &apos; s decisions , which feature in the report , are welcomed by the European Parliament , as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases , thus applying Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty .
That means radical changes , as other candidates have also experienced .
I listened very attentively to Mr Ransdorf ’ s comments ; he mentioned that we need , among other things , a better depreciation policy and more flexible legislation .
This hypocrisy is also apparent from the way in which those protesting so loudly today against Hungary and its Prime Minister , Mr Orbán , were silent when the previous socialist government in Hungary in practice brought its country to the brink of bankruptcy , using force to silence the opposition when it protested at democratic rallies and gatherings .
I congratulate the two foreign secretaries , Ismail Cem and Georgios Papandreos on their initiative and their success .
The people decided their future and , although this involved fighting , conflict and so forth , succeeded in obtaining what they wanted .
It is the view of the European Union that our economy would greatly benefit from agreements in those fields and I believe that is in the interests not only of our industrialized partners but of developing countries too .
The Member States will be able to avoid implementing the regulation for a period of four years , which can be renewed once upon prior notification to the Commission of the reasons for this .
The Commission should , in our opinion , be congratulated on its work , but the Council must not continue to defraud us , demonstrating its congenital inability to take a decision , as is traditional and as usually happens in these matters .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the objectives contained in this report and the solutions that it puts forward will certainly have a decisive impact on the future of Europe ’ s freight transport , in terms of its fluidity and its sustainability .

The diplomatic term for this is &apos; disproportionate response &apos; .
Point 3 : energy companies and large firms can now earn emission allowance by investing in the switch from Chinese coal @-@ fired power stations to gas , in making coal @-@ fired power stations more effective , in solar power stations in Indonesia , in wind farms on the coastlines of developing countries or in retrieving spent gas from rubbish tips .

Why should Bulgaria increase its greenhouse gas emissions when it has an alternative which has been found to be safe ?
What is behind what sociologists call the feminisation of poverty ?
What it said was that only the reproductive cloning of human beings should be rejected , and that would have meant that cloning experiments on embryos were to be permitted and only the creation of a cloned baby would be reprehensible .
Democracy should set limits on the market , including on the ways in which different products may be marketed .
Besides , if a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon were to take place in the Czech Republic , all the signs are that it would not pass there either .

A pipeline is rather like a marriage .
Moreover , there are great differences as to how consumer organisations in the new Member States are structured .
He held discussions with them , interviewed them , campaigned for the release of those of them who were imprisoned and in general fought for the freedom of nations and for justice .
It is not enough to blame national governments .
In the light of this thought , then , what is the fundamental problem ?
The people of the EU stand to gain nothing from more power for a large @-@ scale level of administration that is difficult to influence .

I don &apos;t want this decree to become a dangerous precedent that would question the very respect of the Union &apos;s fundamental principles .
This time the result was 67 % in favour and 33 % against .
The Irish Government should be bold and courageous enough to bring in an amnesty for existing refugees and asylum seekers in Ireland .

The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.00 a.m.
My view is that a third @-@ country national who has legally lived and resided in Europe for a long time should be able to live on more or less equal terms with EU citizens .
We must not seek to respond at any price to a constantly developing market .
Here , perhaps , the Conference of Presidents could be made up of just four group chairmen .
We will be among the first to welcome a positive outcome of the exploration the German Presidency intends to carry out in 2007 and we will give them our full support .
Mr Nielson identified the problems of lack of concerted action and the need for better complementarity with Member States .
Indeed , the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability .
I hope that the new European microfinance facility for employment and social inclusion - Progress - will give them significant support in this respect .
Of the many points that it has been possible to include in this directive or statutory text , I would like to mention one subject in particular , which above all Parliament , but not Parliament alone , regarded as of particular interest , namely the fact that we are also considering , quite specifically , the interests of the disabled .
There is great pressure on the European Union to show candidate countries , by concluding and accelerating association agreements , that EU accession is an attainable goal .
The Commission has agreed to this .
The aim of the compromise text , which is due in large part to Mr El Khadraoui , is to achieve gradual application of the charges in question , so that it is accompanied by gradual renewal of the European fleet .
The EU has already shown the way with the launch of the &apos; Everything but Arms ? initiative which , as we all know , means that the EU is giving the less developed countries duty- and quota @-@ free access to the European market for all products with the exception of arms , or almost all products with the exception of arms .
Mr President , I agree with the rapporteur that significant disparities occur within individual regions and that analyses serving as a basis for the division of Union money should take this problem into account .
As far as the Commission is concerned , it is willing to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload , but we cannot give up the practice of checking the relevance and quality of the proposed programmes , indeed you would be the first to criticise us if we did .
We would also like to see democratic areas opened up with no barriers to freedom of thought or association .
I find it so unacceptable that this should have happened that I should personally like to express my disapproval .
There are already positions of certain international institutions against this measure .
In certain Member States hatred speech , islamophobia and other forms of xenophobia , fueled by stereotypes , prejudice and cliches from the past drive a latent discrimination attitude toward ethnic or religious minorities .
One of the great complaints from our farmers has been that in the past they have not been given sufficient time to make sensible decisions .
The European Investment Bank ( EIB ) has become an important instrument of the Union for eradicating poverty in less developed regions .
However , it is much harder to get people to make and accept the changes needed to achieve those targets .
Mr President , I would echo some of the points which my colleague , Mr Cunha , has made .
Since the Islamic revolution in 1979 , the Iranian authorities have successively eliminated all the most important women &apos;s rights .
As my friend Hans @-@ Peter Martin said , it took decades for the Freedom of Information Act to become law .
Apart from the benefits gained from saving resources and making use of complementarity , this would simplify both the use of the funds by beneficiaries and the management of the funds by the national authorities .
We have spent the last three or four years talking about cutting back on spending at European level , freezing the budget and maintaining the present rate of spending .
As for the means of achieving it , however , this is a very different matter and , personally speaking , I refuse to validate the rapporteur &apos; s excessively liberal alternatives which go beyond the text presented by the Commission , which , however , is intended to promote the competitive European single market .
The nuclear industry must always be monitored comprehensively from production to the final storage and destruction of nuclear waste .
I mention this because it was a compromise amendment , and the compromise was written in German and then translated into other languages .
It is an agreement concerning 70 European boats &apos; right of access to Comorian waters in exchange for a financial contribution of around EUR 600 000 per year .
We now have a further inconvenience added to those experienced so far .

Mr Schiedermeier , you have put me in a difficult position .
As an MEP for London , I am glad to represent many Turks , Turkish Cypriots and Kurds .
There can be no compromise amendment on a text such as the one we have before us . Furthermore , this amendment is designed to replace more than one article in the text and therefore , like Amendment No 106 , cannot be admissible .
Mr President , I welcome the endorsement by the United Nations Human Rights Council ( HRC ) of the recommendations of the Goldstone report and their call for an end to the illegal siege of Gaza , which is causing so much human suffering .
The extension of the MINURSO mandate to the end of January 1999 which the Secretary @-@ General has now proposed is to be used for UN consultations with Morocco .
I am therefore very disappointed that the Commission has not understood the vital role that culture plays in our European identity , and I find it particularly serious that it felt able , on the basis of the interinstitutional agreement containing the financial perspective for 2007 @-@ 2013 , to approve such a tight budget , amounting to only EUR 354 million , compared to the 600 million called for by the rapporteur and the 408 million proposed by the Commission .
We will give everyone the opportunity to make known their views on this .
I cannot begin to grasp how this can be termed undemocratic , for it is a fair and democratic parliamentary procedure that is being followed here .
I should like to add that any future enlargement must be preceded by fundamental reform of the financial perspectives , and by an appropriate increase in the Union &apos;s budget .
The ideology of &apos; fewer and fewer controls &apos; has given way to the realisation that terrorism feeds on our laxity .
There are features which will mean that we embark upon a common road towards fewer drugs and with the goal of leading both society and individuals away from drugs and towards the long @-@ term goal of a society without drugs .
I will take this opportunity though , to remind the House that whether or not Socrates will be completely successful depends largely on the publicity this programme will be given within the individual Member States and the speed of the selection process .
Consequently , new storms against grass @-@ roots incomes and other grass @-@ roots achievements are brewing at the spring Council .
The problems of 2002 still remain and they have been aggravated even more by the latest events , linked to the economic crisis and the impact of climate change on fish stocks .

The Commission will further examine the situation with all relevant stakeholders , as I said , in a meeting to be held on 19 January 2011 in Brussels , where options to ensure the smooth enforcement of the directive will be discussed .
I believe that the regulatory authorities , as selected and decided by the Commission , especially the energy regulatory authorities , play an important role in maintaining their independence from the competition committee .
Allow me to read you the conclusion in English , which dates from November , in other words before SARS . It says :
I would like to add , however , that , particularly in respect of the proposed safety net , in section ( d ) of paragraph 1 , with a ceiling and a floor in local currency , this cannot exceed the limit of + 2 @-@ 3 % at the most , and it appears that section ( e ) of the same paragraph causes more problems than it was meant to solve .
Do we need regional observatories ?
Thank you , therefore , and thanks to those who have contributed to it .
We need to stimulate private sector research funding through a variety of measures , such as venture capital financing initiatives .
The ACP @-@ EU Joint Assembly is meeting in Brussels next week and we hope that all the parties involved will sit round one table with us there .
So , I have the proposal regarding Zimbabwe .
Thank you , Mr Ephremidis .
Mr President , I wish to bring what might appear at first sight to be a more prosaic matter to the House &apos;s attention but which relates , I think , to the way in which Parliament conducts its public relations and tells European citizens about how it works .
Mr President , the acts of violence in the West African State of Guinea @-@ Bissau are causing us serious concern .
The European Union will continue to encourage all Iraqis to play a part in the next stage of the political process by voting on the draft constitution in the October referendum .
In my statement , I nonetheless said that we must open up the markets for electricity , gas , post , rail traffic and air traffic and that we must have a common market for financial services by 2005 and a common market for venture capital by 2003 .
With the forthcoming enlargement , or to be more precise , enlargements , given that candidate countries will integrate in groups , we need to move towards objective criteria for classifying territorial units , so that new members know the rules of play .
There are a few things left out of the Commission &apos;s action programme .
We need to act at EU level to ensure that banks are willing and able to finance SMEs .
- ( FR ) I agree to this procedure .
I was told by Mr Straw this afternoon that two options were being considered .
I am grateful to Mrs Frassoni for again raising the subject of Cyprus , which gives me the chance to tell your House something more about it .
Let me give you an example .
The above considerations lead me to agree wholeheartedly with the institution of an ad hoc delegation of Parliament on the Turkish prison system .
He has described the modern British Conservative Party under its new leader as being faced with a proposal – and I quote directly – that is ‘ head @-@ banging ’ in its extremism .
The Structural Funds have also played a positive role , which they always do for countries that need to benefit from the cohesion policy , but when the crisis began , decisions were made , for example , to increase the resources that could be advanced from the Structural Funds for countries that benefit from them , in particular for Central and European countries .
The shortage of clean water , which will begin to be felt in the coming days , will promote the spread of communicable diseases , especially in western Darfur .
I am sure that they will serve the same purpose as the pole you used to vault with in your youth and will help us to overcome the obstacles facing European integration .
We must ensure that these programmes are continued after 2013 .
Here in this House , we talk about environmental programmes and how to fund them , but we should consider well the way in which we do this .
Today , it is not bean sprouts .
That is why we want best practice and benchmarking in tax policy as well , so that in future , adequate risk and own capital can be made available to the companies .
Left and right is only one dimension in politics . There are others .
Today , however , Chile is fully integrated into the world , an open , dynamic and democratic country that has signed the most complete association agreement that the European Union has ever signed with any other country not aspiring to join the Union .
I hope that the results of the voting will be satisfactory enough to enable me to recommend that this House adopt this report , and that it will be an important vote in the debate which the European Commission started by publishing the Green Paper in November last year .
In other words , we need to set people to work healing the environment , our cultural heritage and the individual , because by following that road we can probably make an important contribution to solving the problem of unemployment .
I could also mention Austria , which has not yet ratified Convention 138 , and Ireland , which has not ratified Convention 111 on non @-@ discrimination .
That is , after all , a question the people often ask .
Then there is the question of a more targeted common agricultural policy .
The European Parliament retains its full role in the codecision procedure .
It is become something of a tourist attraction and it means we can cross the water a little faster , though not perhaps cheaper .
I am thinking of initiatives in the framework of the Union ’ s international policy to reduce or , rather , to root out sex tourism .
Two separate votes are required here .
This means that what has so far often been seen as a deficiency of Brussels or of the Council will also be the responsibility of Parliament .
With regard to the former , I have already said that it is only applied in certain pilot projects .
One is to make port state control more effective .
In its proposal for revision , the Commission is introducing changes that will have worrying consequences for consumers , in terms of variety of choice , quality and price .
The period of 18 months that we are looking at covers three presidencies conducted in three very different styles with three very different degrees of experience .
It is my personal conviction that it can expect the most Slovenia can give .
The Commission must ensure that this project is a major European objective by encouraging the large car companies on our continent to cooperate with one another , with such cooperation extending from research and development to marketing .
A more moderate price cut , together with the conditions mentioned , would grant more chances of survival to sugar beet production and sugar industry in midfield Member States , such as Hungary .
Research must be transformed into growth .
I would recommend him to go round the various Member States among the people of Europe .
The report was adopted unanimously without amendments within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
This country is still a long way from being en route to the EU .
As usually happens , it took the presidency of a small State to demonstrate the necessary intelligence and pro @-@ European approach to attempt to solve such a significant problem .
Is there any better way of doing that than in sport ?
Mr President , on behalf of my colleagues Ripoll and Pérez Álvarez , who have worked on this report - but who are not able to be here - I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Peijs , on her marvellous report , in particular because it deals with a problem which is important for very real and practical reasons .
Company relocations account for some of the latest expenses of capitalism . It is the world &apos;s casino , where the stake is often the dignity of the poor .
As we know , the EU &apos;s dependence on countries supplying oil and gas is increasing .
Instead of having refugee camps in Member States , we shall have them at the gates of Fortress Europe , with worse health and social conditions and without any guarantee of respect for human rights .

The subsequent , quite lengthy procedure involving consultation of the advisory committee of Member States and of stakeholders , and the final adoption by the Commission will normally take around six months .
For the Commission , this is a fundamental point .

The Posting of Workers Directive also contains a most @-@ favoured nation clause for employees and this was not taken into account in the court judgments .
I am sure that farmers are willing to shoulder their responsibilities , but not when they have no control over the cause of the damage .

The fall of the Soviet bloc led to the spread of nuclear material to various states , and the end of unified control over its use and storage raises fears over its irresponsible utilisation or even its deterioration , with unimaginable consequences for the health and safety of the region .
We are calling for flexibility in the aid regulation , we are calling for Structural Fund resources to be reallocated , we are calling for the national cofinancing portion to be reduced , we are calling for national limits on aid to be lifted and we are calling for emergency aid to be paid out quickly ; we want specific dates , not just promises .
( SV ) For us democracy is synonymous with government by the people .
What has become of that study ?
I hope that the relevant authorities will do everything possible to free Alan Johnston .
I wanted to say that Mr Demetriou , Mrs Ludford and Mr Deprez hit the nail on the head ; they identified the challenge faced by the European Union , because achieving a collective European judicial culture - which of course means seriously combating the factors mentioned by Mr Deprez - establishing the independence of the judiciary , providing guarantees and ironing out the disparities between the various judicial systems are the challenges that await us .
Training plastics engineers now to be unemployed in three years time , to then train a type of financial manager who will be unemployed after four years ; I want to ask the European countries of Portugal and Estonia a question .
This is clearly a matter for the Member States , so , in this case , it is a matter for the Belgian authorities .
Thus it is not desirable for the EU to speak with a single voice because that voice will have to speak counter to the opinions of many Member States .
We should therefore support the wording proposed by the European Commission .
If we are talking about a pact , and therefore an agreement between sovereign states concerning further cooperation under the aegis of the EU , then everything is in order .
Only 3 of the 25 Member States include tallow within the scope of the directive .
The measures made public through the initiative of 5 June last and the Council &apos;s conclusions of June and July 2003 seek to make clear the European Union &apos;s support for the Cuban non @-@ violent , democratic opposition and to show the Cuban authorities that trade cannot proceed normally in the absence of tangible gestures from that government .
Unlike in December 2000 , when we discussed Nice in the absence of the Central European countries – Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania , Poland , Czechoslovakia ( which is now the Czech Republic ) , Slovakia , Hungary , and Slovenia , not to mention Malta and Cyprus , none of whom had yet joined us , it is a particularly happy circumstance that today , the day when we are debating the Constitution , we have among us Members from these countries , particularly from those European countries that were once Communist .
The principal function of these Houses of Europe is to bring the European Union closer to its citizens .
It was the rather traditional story of doling out prizes to Member States .
A survey shows that in many countries 60 % to 80 % of the population is against consuming products developed through genetic engineering , out of anxiety about their effect on human health .
However , the citizens themselves do not seem to be aware of that .

Let me say a few words about the process .
On these kinds of activities , we agree with you on the need to have legislation to cover measures which promote EU concerns in DCI countries .
As for Hong Kong , we strongly support demands for the provision of universal suffrage within the territory .
It is true that the Syrian part of Hamas has a great responsibility here .
The construction of an area of freedom , security and justice cannot by achieved by using the lowest common denominator where respect for citizens &apos; rights and freedoms is concerned .

The idea that encouraging homosexual unions and devaluing marriage means fighting to protect children from violence is therefore unacceptable .
It must provide a structure that is flexible and that can be easily integrated with the corresponding national structures , while at the same time upholding the various specific characteristics of those structures .

However , we have noticed in this case that one of these annexes raises a serious problem of immediate conformity and implementation for the industries concerned .
In fact , I mentioned that we tried to adopt a position using a nuanced approach .

Only a small percentage of consumers have the possibility of regularly buying from duty @-@ free stores . Furthermore , with the exception possibly of tobacco products , the advantages in price terms are often only apparent , as the competitive advantages of exemption are not always passed on to the final consumer .
As the Commissioner well knows , the UK &apos;s opting out of the social protocol has this year already blocked execution of the budget line concerning transnational meetings of workers &apos; and employers &apos; representatives ; as in the case of the preliminary draft budget for 1997 , the executive committee is therefore proposing to divide the line in the amending budget , with the specific intention of distinguishing meetings involving representatives of fourteen Member States from those involving representatives of all fifteen Member States .
Scientifically , it is totally wrong to split a TAC , and that is not just my personal opinion .
Madam President , I propose to talk about a human rights violation .
We are not currently sitting in the Spanish Parliament , nor in the Assembly of the region in question , but in the European Parliament , and I cannot prejudge nor anticipate any principle or respect for freedom of expression of the Members .

These judicial authorities are conducting investigations using the powers of the courts .
The Commission is now analysing the question of market economy treatment of the exporters concerned , the definition of the different categories and models of the products involved , the question of whether there is dumping , the impact of these imports on the Community ’ s shoe @-@ producing industry and the position of traders , retailers and consumers .
In an official statement made at the end of July , the Presidency stated that the Union was gravely concerned about the worsening plight of the defenders of freedom of speech and human rights in Iran .

We should say to our Belarusian brothers today that they are not alone .
The fifty per cent of a judge &apos;s salary that is at issue here corresponds , more or less , to what an Austrian , French , German or British MEP currently receives , after health insurance and old age pension contributions have been taken into account .
These methods are not an end in themselves , but a means of turning the intentions , which we share , into a reality ; a reality that our people will really be able to experience in their everyday lives .
If I were to look , for example , at your colleague , Mr Kyprianou : we have just had yet another outbreak of foot @-@ and @-@ mouth in the United Kingdom ; we have got bluetongue ; today it was announced that we have avian flu .
Finally , I would like to say , regarding the accommodation charges here in Strasbourg , it would be helpful if they were the same for the weeks that we are sitting in Parliament as the weeks when we are not sitting .
The structure is far from sound , it is too much of an overview and there is too little evaluation .
The report indicates a very dangerous route for economic policy in Europe .
Discussions concerning , for example , a peaceful solution in Georgia must take place within the framework of the Member States ’ work within the United Nations .
It is not the size of organisations but scientific progress that creates value .
What is more , he refuses to speak Dutch , the language spoken by the majority of people in his country , and has made this a kind of trademark of his .
It would like to see materialise at last all this activity which is essential for combatting , beyond national frontiers , the scourge of organised crime and terrorism .
The main priority must be to fight international terrorism by means of an across @-@ the @-@ board anti @-@ terrorist strategy , at both EU Member State level and on a worldwide scale .

The Amsterdam Treaty was defective in this regard .
At the same time , the Commission also decided on 31 March that it should make available EUR 7 million for the forthcoming elections in Indonesia .
Regrettably , our rapporteur and those who followed her lead have squandered a great opportunity ; this is illustrated , incidentally , by the fact that the report was adopted by only 15 votes to 7 in the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights , while the opinion of the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs was adopted by 18 votes with 11 abstentions .
This problem could also be raised by a number of national parliaments during the ratification procedure which , as we know , will be a complicated and risky process .
Member of the Commission . - ( SK ) Mr President , I would like to express my thanks for the many , very interesting speeches .
Therefore , in my view , it is actually here , in the extent of our willingness , that the greatest threats of globalisation lie hidden , since public opinion in an increasing number of European Union Member States is not ready for the challenges of competition even within the European Union itself .
The new programme will , I am sure , in terms of its structure and organisation based on transparency , efficiency and balance , prove to be an instrument as successful as it is essential to our measures .
I would like to ask the Commission the following questions : do we have accurate statistical data on inter @-@ country adoption cases within the EU or involving third countries ?
The European Union must set about developing cooperation and financial , technical and scientific collaboration with the countries most in need of help , countries less well @-@ equipped to confront the sometimes devastating effects of global warming .
As this was rejected , we voted against the Morillon report .
Turkey should carry out the necessary reforms and face up to its own past in the same way as other European countries have done and continue to do .
When I was growing up , film societies in Britain recognised that Hungarian cinema was a very important part of European cinema .
The same reasoning naturally applies also to the EU ’ s development work and reciprocal cooperation with developing countries .
With this resolution , Parliament is sending out two separate messages .
( ES ) Mr President , I fail to see which Rule of Procedure prevents us from discussing the issue .
In the same way , preventive conflict management is not just about the deployment of a police force ; it involves all three pillars .
The individual nature of work lies at the basis of all activity , and it is important to find an objective way of assessing its value , with clear rules , criteria and indicators which will achieve greater objectivity , and eliminate discrimination through clear legislative measures .
The Union , which is a strong manifold entity , and Russia , which is a superpower , should stop behaving like two towns connected by nothing more than a narrow road and a gas pipe .

One of our major objectives , the euro and its high monetary stability , is at risk of total collapse .
Corrections to votes : see Minutes
Mr President , while fully acknowledging the right of all the Members to speak , I would like , once again , to call upon the House to avoid antagonistic statements , confusing tragic situations such as those just mentioned - immigration tragedies taking place in Italy - with situations and decisions made by the Italian Government relating to matters of infrastructure .
Even more so if we bear in mind that the President of Guinea is one of the signatories of the Cairo declaration and the action plan which accompanies it , which recognises the need to consolidate democratic principles , based on the right of all citizens to choose their leaders freely by means of free elections and , consequently , also the need to ensure that elections are transparent and free , and to adopt the necessary means for their effective observation .
That is why research must help preserve this vanishing natural resource in those areas that still have clean water .
By we , I mean the European Union .
In my opinion it is important to start at an early age with getting acquainted with the approaches of your neighbours or of other religions .
I was given a lot of documents by the Commission .
I would like to say a few words also about the committee of enquiry , the committee which arose from the Sharm el @-@ Sheikh meeting .
I am sorry that the PPE @-@ DE Group cannot join us on this .
Spain therefore has , it has to be said , almost the largest deficit per inhabitant per year in the whole of the European Union .
Mr President , last year , this House debated the use of whole @-@ body scanners at airports and subsequently the European Commission withdrew its proposal in this regard .
It will be modified in a process that cannot be dissociated from recent problems involving alleged lobbying , which have affected Parliament .
I deplore the fact , however , that the European Parliament did not call on the WTO to take account of the multifunctional role of agriculture ; this must not give way to intensive and mass farming , which in any case , European consumers plainly no longer want .
These measures are practical and will help consumers better understand the operation of the single currency .
This has not stopped him putting the media out of action , meaning that any dissident is at his mercy .
I feel it is extremely important to fight together with the United States against terrorism .
That obligatory solidarity is not a contradiction in terms , Mr President .
At the beginning of this debate , several months ago , my committee agreed unanimously with that .
These EEA funds will be made available to the 12 most recent Member States , as well as Greece , Portugal and Spain , and may be used in a number of important areas , including environmental protection , human and social development and the protection of cultural heritage .
It has contributed to the dynamism we need in order , with the wind behind us , to reach our objective in Copenhagen .
As far as the entry into force of the regulation is concerned , we agree in principle with the Commission &apos; s approach that compulsory labelling should be introduced in two stages , but we do not agreed with the timetable insofar as we think that the date of 1 January 2003 has been put far too far back .
I welcome the adoption of the report awarding Portugal EUR 31 255 790 from the European Union Solidarity Fund , following the flooding that occurred in Madeira last February .
Solidarity should still be the guiding principle for this our Europe ; solidarity at home in order to promote a social Europe , but also solidarity with those beyond our borders .
Mr President , Mr Pasty is not on the attendence list for the same reason that that my name and the names of at least fifty people are not on the list today .
We as Parliament must do more than merely drawing up lists of victims and perpetrators .
If Amendment 1 is adopted , then this report would become incoherent and contrary to the interests of the world &apos;s poorest people .
Many will be small , community @-@ based schemes which will be site @-@ specific , whether using wind , waves , solar power , combined heat and power or even biomass .
This approach will continue to guarantee the Member States freedom of action , and so we voted in favour .
The European Union is endeavouring to take steps in the case of companies like Opel , and if any plan is implemented , it will also involve direct help .
Favourable terms should also be made available for healthy organic food produced without the use of artificial fertilisers and pesticides .
What must not happen is for the EU now to go in and provide aid as a thank you to those who voted in favour of the Koffi Annan plan and to forget those who voted against the plan .
It is this interinstitutional agreement which restricts us , but which has also opened up additional opportunities for us ; I shall come back to this .
In other words , is the Commission aware that it still has a responsibility under Article 3 of the ECSC Treaty , or has it forgotten that article ?
The Council must seek to reconcile the potential conflict between a request from the ICC to surrender a person to the court and the obligation stemming from this extradition agreement .
The conclusions of the Portuguese Presidency contain many positive commitments and objectives .
What is required in order to promote combined heat and power ?
Finally , it is no longer a question of European political parties , but rather of political parties at European level .
We are , therefore , also of the opinion that a substantial reassessment of the budget is absolutely necessary , along with an immediate review of the maximum limits of the current MFF .
It is the one that is going to invest funds in tax havens .
It is clear that all superfluous obligations mean greater costs for transport operators , which will ultimately be reflected in ticket prices .
Secondly , it would result in considerable budget costs - approximately ECU 260 million , which is unacceptable in times of strict budgetary discipline .
Firstly , we need clear and commonly agreed principles governing the trade .
SLORC refused to accept the result of the 1990 election which was won by the opposition National League for Democracy .
Amongst other things , it was announced that the cruise industry is responsible for providing around 190 000 jobs within Europe .
Another point of general agreement was that for the Western Balkans , the European perspective is a fundamental element in their progress - as Mrs Giannakou and Mr Winkler pointed out - and this is not only in the interest of those countries but also , as Mrs Göncz has said , in the interest of the European Union .
We have not yet seen all the consequences of the liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets on national energy balances .
The debate is closed .
But this is an opportunity to talk about renewing faith in the Schengen system and the integrity of the European Union itself , and an opportunity to improve a completely outdated and ineffective evaluation mechanism .
The scheme of generalized preferences , in short , as constantly emphasized by the European Parliament and by the Committee on Development and Cooperation , must be regarded as an instrument intended to promote the trade of developing countries and in particular of those less advanced .
The Globalisation Intergroup in Parliament , which I chair , has over 100 members .
It is the fastest @-@ growing population in the EU , in terms of national increase and overall growth .
Mr President , compared with a draft Regulation which is extremely minimalist , the virtue of the report by Mrs Auroi is that it opens up the way to start , albeit very modestly , to reduce our enormous deficit in protein and oleaginous plants .
Question No 42 by ( H @-@ 0634 / 99 ) :
Now it is , of course , the Commission &apos;s job to ensure they are applied and I am sure that the Commissioner will do his bit to ensure that the rules do not remain empty words .
Indeed , contrary to the highly unacceptable custom in this Parliament , the reports from the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights for once appear on the agenda for Tuesday rather than Friday , when most Members have adopted the disgraceful habit of leaving Strasbourg early .
.
Indeed , there needs to be a lot of action because , 15 years after Beijing , we can see that , unfortunately , the results are still of very little significance .
There has been mention of equality .
And also to schemes which will make them independent of the normal education , health care and public transport services , for these have been whittled down to a level that is now only acceptable to the losers .
It is true that we have a new situation in the European Union as far as the protection of human rights is concerned .
In Romania , minorities can address courts in their mother tongue .
I speak as someone with a deep and abiding love for Italy and its people , but I say here to you today , and to President Ciampi of Italy , that Italy had neither the moral nor the legal right to sign the Treaty of Amsterdam until it had removed this most blatant violation of the Convention from its own constitution .
I have , then , virtually answered the first question as to whether we are absolutely committed to reoccupying the renovated building .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , when Denmark joined the EU in 1973 , the EU assumed an Arctic dimension through the Danish dependency of Greenland .
Despite the progress made by the European institutions on openness and transparency , the situation cannot exactly be described as perfect and this recasting of Regulation ( EEC ) No 1049 / 2001 regarding public access to documents held by the European institutions should be seen as another step towards achieving an administrative environment where the availability of , and ease of access to , information are the rule rather than the exception .
Part II
We are completely open to Parliament &apos;s thoughts on the subject .
( DE ) Madam Commissioner , genetic engineering in farmed foods makes many people in Europe uneasy , anxious and afraid .
The mere offer of a job was to be sufficient to justify immigration rights .
The special conditions that prevail in small and remote countries are also relevant here .
I believe that those of you who do not seem to sympathise with her ideas should give her the benefit of the doubt .
I am responding to this specifically by presenting an eight @-@ point programme .
In this context , it is understandable that there should be concern at the speed at which commitments are met by making payments in due time and , at the same time , effectively reducing the amount of delayed payments and reducing the amount of RAL ( amounts outstanding ) .
The annual split allocation of sums for research and the costs of administration should provide the incentive for this .
We must act as one and speak with a single voice in our relations with Russia , in order to save the Baltic .
We also call upon the authorities in Laos to give the Red Cross permission to visit the political prisoners in order to assure themselves of their physical well @-@ being .
We think any suggestions , means and proposals that might be of real help in achieving the final and fundamental objective of stability and progress in Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina must be taken into account .
Why should further reductions in tariffs be made , leading to a further reduction in the public funds available , as requested within the framework of the EPA negotiations , if on the European side the Member States are not ready to make any effort to increase support for the state budgets of ACP countries ?
Really disappointing .
Therefore , we should approve the corresponding amendments tabled by the Group of the European People &apos;s Party .
We share the Commission &apos;s view that short sea shipping- must be encouraged .
Philosophy and ethics are important issues even for you .
The EU side placed considerable emphasis , as Mr Barroso in particular knows , on the importance of the respect for democracy and human rights , notably in the run @-@ up to elections .
On the financial level , Mr Barroso , we must assess the need for reform of monetary and fiscal policy in order to defuse the struggle between our currency , the euro , and the old hegemony of the dollar , and also the struggle with the emerging currencies of China and India ; to obtain stricter regulation of the financial market together with bans on speculation in energy commodities and , above all , food commodities , whose prices can starve many economies ; to bring finance back to its main role of serving production ; and to replace or support the traditional economic contributions in depressed European regions with tax incentives .
The stability pact , which has a shortage of women in its leadership and in which women generally are not involved , shows that there is still a lot to be done .
European legislation will be useful in order to prevent a sort of relocation of advertising to the more lenient Member States .
The Commission has sent letters to each one of the countries concerned and the current proposal takes full account of these replies .
If that equality is not retained at Amsterdam our peoples will be very disillusioned .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in Barcelona we signed with due formality the Charter for the Mediterranean which we had ensured would focus on the rule of law and human rights .
In 2001 , Europe began to take steps to make sure that it was prepared .
Similarly , the Commission must apply itself to the issue of intellectual property , especially in relation to the Internet , which when all is said and done is the business of the Commission ; but because I can see that actually the atmosphere is not conducive to long speeches , I shall just quickly answer the questions that have been posed .
In addition , we need to reinforce the measures to support livestock farming in disadvantaged areas , including Luxembourg .
I have always been one of those people who paid their employees &apos; social insurance contributions and employed them under proper conditions .
In Tampere , the question of granting operational powers was discussed .
It is supreme institutional protection of the dictatorship of the European monopolies .
In the European Union , all of us , including the leaders of large Member States , pledge to place the European citizen at the heart of European policies .
The next item is the report ( A4 @-@ 0412 / 97 ) by Mr Sarlis , on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism , on the Commission &apos;s White Paper &quot; A Strategy for Revitalizing the Community &apos;s Railways &apos; , and the communication from the Commission to the Council , the European Parliament , the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions , &quot; Trans European Rail Freight Freeways &apos; ( COM ( 97 ) 0242 - C40269 / 97 ) .
It is imperative here that this mutual respect should be harmonised with the objectives of the internal market , and with the protection and information of the European consumer .
Mr President , I wish to make three small points to add to what my fellow Members have said .
Secondly , how does the Commission intend to make additional EU budget resources available ?
The tax bases must be harmonised ; the business tax systems must not only be harmonised but must also become transparent and comparable , and fiscal giveaways and special enterprise zones , which have lost any connection with fiscal competition , must become things of the past .
Mr President , Madam Vice @-@ President of the Commission , I should like to start by congratulating the two rapporteurs , Mr Jarzembowski , who has taken over from Mr Pavlos Sarlis , our former fellow Member of the European Parliament who acted as rapporteur for the first reading , and Mr Swoboda , for their reports .
Migration is undoubtedly a phenomenon of the globalised world in which we live .
Frankly , I have to say that I am disappointed that so very few Members of our House have stayed for what is a hugely important debate .
The Commission should be authorised to adjust and adopt common safety measures and common safety targets .
I am thinking in particular , although not exclusively , of the awareness campaigns and donations in mobile units that could come to an end if we were to require the presence of a doctor .
My group has therefore retabled Amendment No 138 to the effect that in the event of disagreement over the legal basis , the Legal Affairs Committee must be consulted , not informed .
This has particular significance for the UK .
It is absolutely essential that the Commission puts forward a proposal for the amendment of the directive on preparations as soon as possible in order to answer some of the questions connected with the fourth risk category in the Swedish chemical legislation .
I can certainly endorse some of Mrs d &apos;Ancona &apos;s criticisms of the Council document on the post @-@ 1999 EU drugs strategy .
I cannot fathom why the Council cannot do as Parliament requires in this respect .
The targets set at the session in New York in June 1998 were admittedly rather ambitious .
Europe &apos;s message to consumers over all these years has been : choose energy label Α .
I wish the Council and Commission much success in their attempts at long last to ensure that their interference does not lead to more violence and suppression , but to a peaceful solution which is sustained by all the parties
In the economic sphere , the single market in goods and factors of production was the theme of the 1980s ; the single currency that of the 1990s .
The European Council asked that every effort be made in the framework of the legislative process relating to the services directive to build a broad consensus behind each of these objectives .
The promises made must be kept .
The general effect of the rural exodus is excessive urbanization , with all the adverse social consequences and additional costs that involves , for both the rural and the urban areas .
The purpose of a grand European security strategy is not to be admired , but to be followed , and too often the Council and the Member States have failed to follow their excellent strategy .
If they bothered to turn up at the committees to which they are entitled to turn up , they would know that we are not voting on this today but we are going to vote on this in January .
It is not sufficient that a product is intrinsically toxic . Even water can be fatal if consumed in an enormous enough quantity to cause drowning .
In the French version that becomes &apos; entreprises pharmaceutiques et organisations scientifiques &apos; .
This is a serious threat to agricultural production , so it must be fought using Union instruments for this reason too .
My group was initially unhappy with the procedure that has been followed in this matter .
Allow me once again to express my thanks to the political groups and to my colleagues for their highly constructive and helpful support throughout the process of drafting the report .
It beggars belief that eight EU Member States have no immediate plans to sign the Convention .
However , this was strongly opposed by the Council .
The single currency must soon be followed by a common defence policy so that Europe can guarantee peace , including beyond its own borders .
Another point which merits criticism is that a significant proportion of allocated budgetary funds are still not being used .
There has been no increase in appropriations for research and development whatsoever .
I fully support this resolution , particularly regarding the need to encourage the integration of new information and communication technologies in education and training systems in Europe , thereby improving the quality of those systems and access to them .
This could be the start of a radical reform which would improve the situation of the mountain regions and all the less @-@ favoured regions , giving them the same opportunities for life and growth as the rest of the Community .
This would , however , be desirable .
Economic and social cohesion is one of the European Union &apos;s basic pillars and is directly related to the single market , and in my view , to the establishment of the single currency as well .
that the peculiarities of national tax systems arise from the peculiarities of national economies , which cannot be eliminated , despite all efforts to ignore them ; -that tax harmonization , if supra @-@ nationally imposed after the adoption of the euro , which now serves as a pretext and justification , would take away yet another instrument of sovereign and ( democratic ) government , especially as regards savings , from the national authorities ; -that the inequalities of the weakest in terms of competitiveness may be seriously aggravated in the name of standardizing competition by means of tax reforms.The tax reform we are fighting for , at Community and national level , is a tax reform , or rather a series of tax reforms , that aims to create fairer tax collection systems with a reduction of the tax burden on working people , and not harmonized rules that lead to fresh and increased exemptions in favour of capital that already circulates too freely .
Research is , by definition , risky and if the European Union wants , as you all hope , to develop this strategic sector , we cannot create a watered @-@ down system or institute vague measures .
Making addiction a crime also does not work .
The existing directive has , as I just said , an article , Article 17 , which allows a number of exceptions , which in theory offers enough opportunities to consider specific cases and also to take account of the competitiveness of the various sectors and activities .
Mr President , Commissioner , the report which I have the honour to present is the result of an extraordinary collaboration - which I am grateful for - between people and committees .
That is the wrong direction to take .
There will no longer be development or a social model if the Euro group does not address the issue of common economic policy alongside that of monetary policy .
Immediate action is also needed to prevent a repeat of the devastating fires of two years ago , which were partly caused by a dry period , albeit not even approaching the scale of this one .
More advantages will become apparent , for example in the holiday season that is just beginning .
If he is going to a country that is not a party to the ACTA Agreement , then it will depend upon the customs and police of the country concerned , but that is beyond our reach .
I think that the Union &apos; s natural role would be to dedicate itself to this , and I hope we can build on this report to make Parliament and the Commission aware of the need for intervention .
I tabled this question on 14 May and we are now in July ; if the Council had wanted to answer , it would have provided some information yesterday on the number of human lives lost .
Deciding to immediately immobilise a road vehicle when an unannounced check has revealed a manifest defect is a necessary step in protecting users &apos; safety .
Both of these possess nuclear weapons and one of them at least has not disavowed first use of those weapons .
Firstly , instead of wanting to maintain its domination over these historically constituted ancient nations , admittedly federated within Yugoslavia but with a constitutionally recognized right to secede - which will also be the case , I hope , for our countries within the European Union - , Serbia would do well to free itself from communism .
As in the case of Natura 2000 , they are contrary to the will of the people , as France pointed out at the Environmental Council in June 2003 .
We do have liability rules for providers of certification services .
EPJUST has an initial duration of 18 months and is funded under the Instrument for Stability , but can be extended .
In order to really tackle the problem of human trafficking , all Member States must put a great deal of effort into preventive work .
It is surely up to each party to decide how many men and women it wants to offer as candidates and up to voters to pass judgment on them .
It is essential that we in Parliament and the Commission , keep our minds , and our ears and our eyes open , for new ways of tackling the unemployment problem .
Basically , although a large number of amendments appear on paper , today we are confining ourselves to just one - Amendment 63 , which is the one that sums up the spirit of the compromise .
This is the only regasification plant in Spain that will not have an environmental impact assessment , thereby creating a lack of security and infringing clear Directives .
But we are supposed to be serious and we have to look at the figures and remain rational and honest .
More must be done to promote the product on the international markets .
If you have some other statistics , then maybe things are different .
We do not envisage having only one centre , located somewhere in the Community , but rather several coordinating centres according to specific groups of diseases or to response duties , a process which allows the Member States full discretion about their involvement .
With this Council presidency , you will find no reservations when it comes to seeking openness .
( FR ) Mr Barroso , all the same , the question was clear .
A question was asked about how the contact points would function .
She is six months pregnant . Her condition is extremely frail and she does not have full @-@ time access to medical attention and treatment .
The ECB attaches the highest importance to regular dialogue with the European public and with its elected representatives .
As Mrs Van Lancker has already commented , the development of Schengen cooperation has reached an important turning point .
Ladies and gentlemen , we have also discussed measures , cultural aspects , lawmaking and many other aspects of this complex issue .
Results in implementing the Strategy have so far been disappointing , since both the productivity and the competitiveness indicators in the EU have lagged behind US indicators and those of some Asian countries .
A report from the Commission shows that since 1995 , the contribution of women to economic growth in the EU has increased by a quarter , and that the female employment rate increased by 7.1 % over the last decade and reached 59.1 % .
It is about time this was settled and I believe , ladies and gentlemen , that we all have an interest in dealing quickly with this point so that it can be removed from the agenda .
As we have previously stressed , such decisions clearly indicate the antidemocratic nature of the EU , which is inseparable from the position it assumes as an imperialist bloc .
And the next headline will become the priority .
I believe this also to be a right ; asylum is a right , not a favour .
Better lawmaking is not just about repealing legislative proposals in the internal market policies ; it is also about proposing things that are good for the citizen – something that Parliament has been calling for consistently .
Indeed , one of the interesting aspects of France &apos;s initiative aimed at creating a Union for the Mediterranean - which , for that matter , I supported from the very start - is that it brings a stronger element of regional cooperation .
The SYNERGY programme may make a contribution here .
Mr President , in the CFP reform process , I have consistently favoured retaining the founding principle of relative stability - installing the coastal zones as a permanent feature of the CFP at least up to 12 miles and strengthening the role of the proposed regional advisory councils so that real involvement of stakeholders can be achieved .
This is clear evidence of a development block , which is due precisely to the failure to exploit our human potential .
This means that Parliament can examine these financing proposals and , if the Commission oversteps its authority , Parliament may adopt resolutions to ask the Commission to change the decisions in question .
I can only say that I would warn people against over @-@ dramatising and exaggerating the situation , as you have just done .
With all due respect , I think it is absolute nonsense to be suggesting here that the payment of refunds for exports of live animals should be abolished . That would make no sense .
I therefore would like to say that I am very pleased to say here today that the Spanish Partido Popular has supported the objectives of the Spanish Government in the European Presidency at such an important time for the European Union .
What a responsibility to have ruined historic opportunities such as the Arab League peace plan since 2002 , the success of the first democratic process in Palestine in 2006 or , more recently , the establishment of a last @-@ chance national unity government , all by aligning ourselves with the deadly strategy of the White House !
Mr President , compared with Hungary , Russia is not a model of democratic transition . Any such comparison would be incorrect and a political error .
The enormous participation in the debate on the White Paper and your own contributions - especially the report by Mrs Kaufmann - show that this was the right strategy .
Can it now outline what proposals it intends to table ?
First of all , the globalised nature of the financial markets which we are now dealing with , and the issue of how quickly regulation or supervision can keep pace with the way new products are being developed and new ideas are being developed .
I suggest to the Taoiseach that he would be better advised to refer to the New Union , which is also the Old Europe .
Therefore , the crucial role of public services has to be defended .
Let us consider where we stand today .

Mr Perry raises several questions in his report , to which I would like to respond , without prejudice , of course , to the consultations under way .
Each year , disasters cause significant economic loss , loss of life and an increased incidence of the many diseases linked to environmental pollution .
My question is this : can that possibly be fair ?
There must be an international conference on Afghanistan ; and , Commissioner , I believe that it is time to decide on a European Union joint action in the context of the CFSP , to follow up Mrs Bonino &apos;s bold , courageous and unequivocal actions .
We shall not have to foot the bill for this , but will pass it on to future generations , who will have to pay it with compound interest added .
However , this agreement only makes sense if it is in the interests of all parties .
The truth is that the increasing importance that consumers attach to sustainable development has led to a disconcerting range of private labels , without any kind of control , which may undermine their initial purpose , that is , as guarantees of a catching and processing system that respects the environment .
The principle of taking precautions , and the protection of the environment and of consumers , must take precedence over economic interests , and we therefore want to hear your position with regard to the accusations regarding the marketing approval and the question of how to proceed further .
I think that is very sad .
I believe that this opens up very extensive employment potential in the postal administration in particular , which can prepare its existing staff for this very interesting challenge by means of training and further training measures .
This need to harmonise interests traditionally arises in the area of freedom and privacy in particular .
I welcome the way in which decisive steps are being taken to combat illegal immigration , whether by the introduction of the &apos; Eurodac &apos; system or by joint patrols of the external borders by a Eurocorps , doing the best job possible with the aid of satellites and radar .
I refer in particular to the areas in Southern Italy .
The latest elections in Nigeria turned out very disappointingly , as the Council indicated in its statement of 27 April ; there were numerous irregularities and acts of violence , with up to 200 people being killed and many more than that injured or intimidated , and the Council expects the persons responsible for these acts of violence to be called to account for their actions .
As with all food sectors , poultry farmers , and particularly chicken farmers , have made enormous efforts in recent decades .
These were prepared taking into account the special sensitivities of a few Member States concerning this important issue , because , as our experiences have shown , in some Member States the speedy implementation of the free movement of work force is not only hindered by economic difficulties , but often by political , sociopsychological or communication difficulties , too .
However , I believe that it is important to ensure the same restriction and during the Presidency I , personally , am going to look at what can be done to establish a framework that is perhaps more coherent if still as restrictive .
Are they six or twelve years old ?
The Commission proposal is ambiguous and inappropriate since scientists do not promise any results for 10 to 15 years and this research does not match the urgency of the needs of patients who are suffering while they wait for a treatment to be found .
Let me reiterate at this point that Europe , in my view , could not possibly play the pioneering role which would fulfil the hopes of people throughout the world on the basis of high @-@ risk nuclear energy or of a renewed reliance on coal .
What is being done to support the pioneering work of the mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in mobilising cities throughout the world to work for the total abolition of nuclear weapons ?
The workers &apos; and popular movement is thus lumped together with capitalists , whom the report has the nerve to describe as representatives of civil society .
Today we are discussing the future of Kosovo .
Brussels finally realised the folly of its policy to stifle production .
This is something very important .
Thank you very much and I await your opinions with interest .

If we are talking about security and who pays for it , that will have an economic aspect tomorrow as well .
Several of you referred to the Schengen area and to the importance of having high quality immigration policies in place .
They teach us , in the most direct way , that we are , at one and the same time , the same and different.&apos;
This is an excellent pledge , but unfortunately , it does not apply to the Netherlands .
And I am therefore particularly anxious about , and particularly surprised at , the attitude of the GUE / NGL Group on the one hand , and that of the PPE @-@ DE on the other which now - at this of all times - wants to back @-@ track and scale down a number of our positions , not only on the open method of co @-@ ordination , but also on the social objectives of the pension system .
In my view , the Asian crisis - although developments must of course be closely watched - will not have any effect on the launch of the euro on the scheduled date .
We made this point in the resolution we adopted last month and , with this in mind , we call on the current German and forthcoming Portuguese Presidencies to consider proposals that the EU might like to put on the table .
The next item is the joint debate on :
I bid a warm welcome to Amira Dotan and the members of her delegation , with whom we have already had the opportunity - on Tuesday - to converse at greater length .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , I , too , should like to start by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Takkula .
Much talked about solidarity will not be infinite and , unless we call the malefactors to order , the citizens of countries such as Estonia might lose their patience .
I voted for this report because in Romania as well as in other Member States we are sometimes faced with crises which affect public and animal health safety in relation to animal products , such as transmissible spongiform encephalopathy , dioxin , swine fever and foot @-@ and @-@ mouth disease .
Madam President , I too would like to add my voice to those who have thanked Mrs Gebhardt and Mrs Van Lancker for their considerable work on this .
Mr President , firstly I would like to thank Mr Blak for the work he has done on this very important , but very difficult and complicated subject .
Mr President , each year hundreds of thousands of couples are sentenced to a childless life because the woman is unable to produce eggs .
As with any accession so far , it is to be expected that this will not always be an easy task , but we trust that we have embarked with Iceland on a successful journey .
Why is this so ?
It is time for Europe to develop a common vision and strategic planning for space exploration .
To achieve the latter we need LEADER type programmes to assist small @-@ scale enterprises to develop new jobs in high technology as well as in tourism , traditional crafts and skills and environment @-@ enhancing projects .
The Earth &apos;s climate has waited long enough .
These ethnic Russians are being replaced by illegal Chinese migrants , a situation which may cause tensions in the future in that vast , under @-@ populated but resource @-@ rich territory .
What has happened since then ?
Of course , the changeover from road to rail will be expensive , and will necessitate large investments .
Europe cannot be left behind .
This means that in practice freedom of choice does not exist .
Better drivers should be driving on our roads .
Research in the construction sector is moving towards a greener approach to building .
Let us not forget that the system we are going to implement is an extremely complex , extremely technical system , and concerns approximately 100 million animals throughout the EU .
Enlargement makes a most positive contribution to the future of Europe , the importance of which will become more and more apparent with each passing day .
in writing . - ( FR ) This resolution loses its impact because important amendments relating to the recognition of the Armenian genocide have been rejected by the majority of Members .
The second strand in our action on immigration will be to protect the Member States of the European Union from illegal immigration , share out the costs of protecting our common external borders more equitably , promote repatriation policies and speed up negotiations on readmission agreements .
At the moment , the car industry has undertaken to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 140 g / km by 2008 as part of a voluntary agreement signed in 1998 .
The Spanish Presidency would therefore very sincerely like to thank all the European institutions - Parliament , the Commission and the Council - and all the Member States for their cooperation in completing this exercise . It has been an exercise involving , firstly , flexibility and adaptation and , secondly , responsibility and a desire for consensus , which has been expressed this afternoon .
I would stress the support of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , first of all , for speeding up negotiations and achieving a new agreement , which certainly meets the planned schedule and , if possible , speeds it up in order to send a positive message with regard to the good will of the European Union in this integration process .
Due to the time constraints , I will just mention a few example species which , in our opinion , are in need of a high or an even higher level of protection .
There is an urgent need for cooperation on the application of intellectual property rights , including measures to strengthen cooperation in the fight against counterfeiting and piracy , with a clear roadmap to facilitate mutual recognition of international patent law .
We cannot , therefore , complain or call this process a simple comitology procedure .
Following the end of negotiations it took nine months for the Commission proposal to be tabled and a total of ten months before it was referred to Parliament .
I would like to express my support for the Russian authorities in their quest to arrest and prosecute the people responsible for this horrific attack quickly , and I can assure you all that my emotions are not purely rhetorical .
I would like to call to mind not only the Erika or the Prestige , as mentioned by Mr Sterckx , but - and this is the task that I have set myself for my report on the sector - I would also like to say that we must avoid tragedies such as that of the Princess of the Stars , with 800 deaths in the Philippines , as well as the &apos; mere &apos; 4 deaths recorded in the collision between a container ship and a hydrofoil on the Strait of Messina or again the &apos; mere &apos; 2 deaths a few days ago among those on La Besogne , which hit a bateau mouche in Paris .
I am very critical of the call for the incorporation of arms research into the common strategic framework for research and innovation .
– Mr President , today there has indeed been a very positive development as regards the agreement achieved in New York .
Having thanked the Presidency , I have to say that the direction of the debate , which defines this final summit as a Council towards a Europe of results , leaves me truly perplexed .
Honourable Members , it is time for Europe &apos; s parliaments to remember why they are really there , that it is for them and them alone to create a constitution .
This dramatic incident was necessary for the world to discover the problem of Yemen - a new source of terrorism .
. Mr President , I have just come from a public meeting in Lorraine on the European Constitution , at which the majority of people were in favour of our having a European foreign minister and him having an External Action Service under him .
Its protection should be taken seriously : indeed , wars are being increasingly fought over water resources .
I advocate comparable rules of measurement within the European Union as a matter of principle , and I also believe it to be self @-@ evident that the action plans we arrive at on the basis of these measurements must be drawn up by the member countries , which must also implement and supervise them .
The sector has been growing by 10 % each year , and contributes to the creation of jobs .
What assessment can we make of 15 days of crisis management ?
Europe needs to achieve full employment .
Parliament ’ s report suggests that prudential rules be laid down to ensure that EIB loans do not compromise the sustainability of the Member States ’ public debt .
Diplomatic relations between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda have been restored .
What we want you to do is to put some serious enforcement and simplification behind the existing internal market directives .
Mr President , can I associate myself with Mr Swoboda &apos; s remarks .
The countries involved took a sovereign political decision to pass on a national responsibility for a central aspect of their economic policy to a European institution .
This is also good news , even if we as the European Union are shareholders in other banks and therefore suffer the loss of credit allocations .
We need to realise that if we were to assume that cohesion policy is a policy only for the poorest , then it should slowly come to an end , which means it should slowly disappear completely from the list of European policies .
I understand the concerns underlying these Amendments , no one wants these European pathways to amount to mere tourism , as was referred to in the contributions .
We shall speak of the efficient use of the division of labour that will develop smoothly in the enlarged single market , which is now assuming continental dimensions and which must compete successfully on a global scale with the Far East and North America .
Please take these two examples as proof of the fact that Parliament is much more in favour of reform than the report might suggest .
It is right to talk about a partnership of equals .
I should be grateful for your response , Mrs Lulling .
In present times smoking has become far more common among young women , and will account for an increase in female deaths in the future .
We owe it to our citizens , and to democracy , to provide a better explanation of what happens in Brussels .
We think this is potentially an extremely important institution , particularly in view of some of the appalling things that have happened in the last few years .
Many people argue that large sections of the Taliban could be brought back into civic society , but to do that would be to shift the social centre of gravity back towards an Islamic conservatism that bodes ill for women &apos;s emancipation .
- ( LT ) I believe that today Parliament will demonstrate its maturity in moving the Lisbon reforms forward .
There are too many barriers to the free flow of the four freedoms , and they limit the market &apos;s potential , while the protectionist policies of Member States are inconsistent with the principles of the internal market .
We thank Mr Seixas da Costa , but he can also write his letter to the three kings .
and
The main thing is that enforcement of the judgments of the European Court should remove the causes leading to violation of human rights .
There should be a clear majority in the House for a change of responsibilities , not just a small margin , especially when , as at present , we have said two different things in two different amendments .
What it has clearly demonstrated is that there is no way of resolving the comitology problem merely through more information , exchanges of letters , and documents from the Commission . They are important , but they are not enough !
This is the price of what we owe to the memory of the Rwandans .
Mr President , Commissioner , within her very comprehensive report , Mrs Hieronymi has emphasised the importance of the Media 2007 programme ’ s proposals . The programme reuses the structure and the mechanisms of the current programmes , which have proved to have had a very positive impact on the audiovisual sector .
Finally , I should like to thank the rapporteur for referring to a particular element , one that is both positive and important for economic and social development , namely the geographical and strategic potential for relations between Europe , Africa or the Americas , with the possibility of developing particular industries or maritime services .
Mrs Maij @-@ Weggen , you started your speech by thanking everyone for their contributions to the Convention .
As the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets I should like to say that our committee also voted in favour of enabling us to go ahead with this agreement .
Agricultural products are now an integral part of the World Trade Organisation negotiating round .
Hope because the limited progress which has been made in the meantime will somewhat improve the former Treaty .
Nevertheless , given the pressures from the CAP on farmers &apos; incomes and bearing in mind the needs of Portuguese farmers , stabilising degressivity should cover the whole period of the current financial framework , in other words , until the 2005 / 2006 season .
In the first place , BSE has not been eradicated in Great Britain , and will not be eradicated .
Should we not increase market access and abolish export subsidies on products that are strategic for those countries and adopt a framework initiative in favour of fair trade ?
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I will be relatively brief - not because I do not recognise the importance of the issue , but rather because of the lateness of the hour .
I should also like to mention a concern which I do not share and which , fortunately , has been mentioned by few , namely religion .
We are in a position to create financial leeway for 2001 , which we will hopefully be able to turn to good account when it comes to dealing with the administrative side of enlargement .
Mr President , NATO intervened in Yugoslavia maintaining that they were defending Kosovans from Serb persecution , but no @-@ one intervened to defend the Kurds from Turkish persecution .
With Eurojust we now have a new instrument which will become operational in 2002 and will represent decisive progress in cooperation between the judicial authorities .
The situation in Russia , for example , shows that privatisation which enables a small number of people to monopolise a country &apos;s wealth is definitely not a sound basis for a socially adjusted free market .
The importation of vaccinated animals and the exportation of meat from animals that are vaccinated is governed by the OIE rules .
We need to bear in mind that if , tomorrow when they have reached adulthood , the children of today are unable to use the new technologies , they will be almost like children of our own time who are illiterate , and that is something we cannot allow .
As long as that is so , no transport with an overall length of more than eight hours should be allowed .
Where is the truth in all of this ?
With a view to explaining why I imposed these penalties , I should like to read to you what I wrote to the Members concerned when I informed them about the disciplinary action taken against them . I quote : &apos; I fully accept your right , and the right of any Member , to be opposed to the Charter of Fundamental Rights or the Treaty of Lisbon and to express that view in accordance with the provisions of the Rules of Procedure .
Even so , it is concerned about a number of points which I would like to take up .
In his poem &quot; Herinneringen aan Holland &quot; &#91; &quot; Reminiscing about Holland &quot; &#93; , a famous Dutch poet mentioned water too , which , with its never @-@ ending trail of destruction , was feared and respected .
It must be seen in the context of the overall effort to find solutions for all seven proposals .
Surely voluntary agreements would do the job just as well without a flood of red tape and regulations .
These objectives were confirmed by the Council &apos;s position .
However , I consider it important that the European Parliament should repeatedly stress safety and should above all focus on its commitment to alternative forms of energy in relation to energy generation .
We do not know of a single incident where a person in breach of the law has been called to account .
I told him that he knew what he had to do - in the interests of his country - and that he should do it .
Questions Nos. 61 to 72 will be answered in writing ( 1 ) .
Haiti will only be able to achieve the political , economic and social stability it needs if its country &apos;s freedom is protected from foreign interference .
in writing . - In favour . This resolution basically says that the EP shares the assessment by the Commission &apos;s 2010 progress report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and regrets that the Council has not taken a decision on the opening of accession negotiations , as recommended by the Commission for a second year in a row and in line with previous Parliament resolutions .
It results in major differences in the cost of living and in labour and social costs , as well as highly disparate environmental standards , which are likely to continue for some time .
Listening to this debate I feel as though I am from a different planet , living as I do in a country , Greece , which , as Mrs Jackson said , is one of those countries which depend heavily on landfills for the disposal of waste .
In addition , yesterday we saw a textbook example of possible conflicts .
We must not tire in our efforts and must never give up on promoting the Sakharov initiative until , as we have requested and as is his right , Oswaldo Payá is able to come here and speak to us .
This support is essential for helping the unemployed and the victims of the relocations that occur in a globalised world .
Instead , if appropriate , we will switch after two years to binding targets if we notice that in the first two years , the voluntary phase has not resulted in progress towards 20 % in the Member States .
The Roma should also be encouraged to take responsibility themselves , an aspect that has been completely overlooked here .
In June , the plenum of the European Parliament approved , on second reading , a modification - the seventh - of this Directive which laid down the prohibition of the marketing of products which have been tested on animals , five years after its entry into force .
Parliament must therefore tighten up the Council proposal now before us .
The second great idea that you can find in our proposals and which runs like a thread through them is that we must get closer to the people , the men and women who are active in the field .
For a number of years , thanks to Parliament , these agreements have all contained what is called the &apos; human rights &apos; clause .
What we are now going to see is that gigantic investments are necessary here .
Within this context , we should not have any illusions with regard to the possibilities of modifying current political decisions on the basis of pressure .
Secondly , we must take the two degree target seriously .
We also urgently need to ensure that Mauritania requires that third countries with which it establishes other agreements should respect the same rules followed by vessels flying the EU flag , so preventing competitive inequalities that put the EU fleet at a disadvantage .
Moreover , due to the immense economic and social interests involved , we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event , as is now quite normal .
Italy itself is also in need of substantial loans and grants .
We also need tangible progress on the rights of EU citizens to move freely and reside elsewhere .
It would be even more remarkable to see a number of French Members siding with the Council and thus depriving agriculture of even more money than the Commission is proposing .
The trans @-@ European telecommunications networks are the way to ensure that this exchange of information takes place .
Commissioner , I have not talked about parental leave , but about paternity leave .
It is true that the attitude of the United States toward Iraq , for example , is regrettable .
Scientific fisheries research is vital to ensure an appropriate fisheries management policy , which must take into account the social , environmental and economic aspects of this activity which is an essential source of food .
Then , on 21 March , the Foreign Ministers , the trustees of the areas of the common foreign and security policy , and common security and defence policy , reiterated their commitment .
I hope that nine old Member States will realise this , and that in April 2006 , at the end of the two @-@ year transitional period , the remaining nine Member States will also make a favourable decision , joining Finland , Spain and Portugal , who are opening up their market now .
Europe has never had a greater need of a balanced , liberal approach to migration and asylum .
In individual cases , the Ombudsman can spare the institution unjustified criticism , being , as a sort of outsider , able to lay claim to absolute objectivity .
It is one child , then a second child , then a third child , then a fourth ; each of them not just a child , but somebody &apos;s child ; each a funeral that should never have happened ; each a life that could be saved - a tragedy , I believe , that strikes at the very soul of my being and yours .
I would like to report the position of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education and the Media , which was fairly clear here .
The financial effort from the budget of the European Union is , nevertheless , modest , since it only came to EUR 276.1 million in 2001 .
First of all , I would like to again recall the political imbalance of the Commission .
The Commission , however , is not disposed , certainly at this juncture , to contemplate the possibility of sanctions of various kinds , including the ones suggested by the honourable Member , simply because the Commission is making its contribution and its commitment on behalf of the Union in full knowledge of the dire needs of people and organisations in that area .
One of the problems is posed by donations .
It gives to a purely administrative authority the outrageous power to prosecute and impose penalties .
. I endorse the directive on the addition of vitamins , minerals and certain other substances to foods .
The objective of the open coordination method in the field of asylum policy must be that all countries shall fulfil obligations and endeavour to bring about improved standards and greater security , and that is a good thing .
There are many new challenges facing us on how we will run the Community spending from the year 2000 on .

The capital that we invest in them , as tomorrow &apos;s achievers , is our best economic investment for the future .
I cannot understand why the document clutches at the straw of exports .
There is quite simply no Europe at all .
I hope in the course of this plenary that Parliament will be able to give its opinion on the proposed framework regulation .
I have therefore , as in the two preceding years , voted against the discharge resolution .
I think this is an infringement of the Rules of Procedure , though probably not intentional .
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Yet writing a blank cheque is , of course , no solution .
The European institutions must play a central role in this process , rebuilding a consensus and reconnecting with citizens .
At the same time , livestock premiums were introduced for dams and male bovines , and the intervention prices were reduced sharply .
This is a very sensitive area that varies appreciably across the Member States .
I would like to say to Mr Stevenson that a decision was made before I took the chair not to use the blue card procedure in this debate , precisely in order to be able to give the floor to all Members who asked to speak .
This means efficient , safe , secure and environmentally friendly maritime transport services .
There are plans to double its capacity in 1997 , which will create an additional 900 jobs .
In this area , I would appeal to the President and the Commission : the whole of the EU needs to make an active and vigorous contribution .
Question Time ( Commission )
It is now politically important , as , in 2004 , it will become a neighbouring country of the European Union .
Try as we might , we are unlikely to reach 200 this afternoon unless everybody turns up .
Once again , on the one hand , we need to support rural regions by driving the expansion of the broadband network into these areas while , at the same time , the infrastructure of these regions is being cut back as a result of the privatisation of the rail network , post office , and so on .
The organisation of the International Criminal Court conference in Uganda is an important sign of this international institution &apos;s acceptance across the continent of Africa , especially as the Court &apos;s initial investigations , after it was established in 2002 , were launched here .
We should therefore learn from that crisis so that we can deal with any future pandemic threats more effectively .
Too much violence , not enough talks , and a Palestinian state much reduced in size into the bargain .
In this connection , I should also like to thank my colleague , Mr Rasmussen , who has done some constructive work in drafting the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs so that the report also focuses on the EU ’ s external policies .
Even Parliament , to be honest , is sometimes guilty of this .
President Klaus Hänsch , in his speech to this House when you were awarded the Sakharov Prize , was waiting impatiently for the day when you could speak to us in person .
This is why innovative and professional policy measures , such as promoting the use of environmentally friendly vehicles or developing route planners , are playing an increasingly large role .
The lessons of history tell us , too , that newly independent countries immediately create their own currency - which is surely not a matter of chance - and often do so successfully , as in the case of Czechoslovakia , or rather the Czech Republic , or Slovenia or Estonia .
I really regret the way in which the Council has refused to discuss the matter properly with Parliament .
At least , I do not hope so .
The most worrying aspect for the EU is that investors will lose confidence , as they will see that the regulatory body is moving the goalposts in the middle of the game .
1996 was a critical year in the 1994 @-@ 1999 planning phase since , following two years of delays and difficulties , it proved to be a year of intense activity .
I as a Dutch delegate to the Intergovernmental Conference am not aware of any proposal , even from the Swedish Government , to change that .
We also succeeded in striking a small blow against the global Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda ( FDLR ) . However , we have not been able to put an end to the cruel civil war .
Ukraine may serve as an example .
But it is clear that , in Mediterranean countries that are not , or not yet , members of the European Union , the situation of women is more worrying in many regards , and that we need , and this is perfectly legitimate , to devote more attention to trying to remedy incidences of unacceptable discrimination .
In fact , this is quite simply wrong ; our mandate states quite specifically that we can indeed propose this for various products .
This is not only a ridiculously large amount but also another remarkable feat : managing to declare EUR 2 000 every day .
I would be very interested to learn , therefore , how the Commission views the matter .
The Commission proposal works on the assumption that private firms will be involved , including financially .
Where access to wildlife is restricted , people will have to adapt and continue to adapt in ways that entail even greater risks .
She was an exceptional woman .
Since this is a complex problem , I welcome this debate .
It was this that led the Presidency to call the informal meeting in Bregenz in Austria on 2 and 3 March , the object being to devote two whole days , at European level , to road safety to the exclusion of all else .
Mr President , they might have only one language in the House of Commons , there are however a variety of accidents which from time to time cause difficulty with understanding .
For example , the report stresses that enhanced liberalisation of the services market in particular is needed to promote competition , thus offering lower prices for consumers , which we well know is contradictory and serves only the interests of companies .
We are not joining in the game , therefore ; we are not dutifully delivering our opinion .
I would suggest that Europol would be a very appropriate place to have this centralized agency capable of responding within 24 hours .
Mr Brok ’ s report , on which we shall be voting tomorrow , refers to progress in the area of common foreign and defence policy , but also mentions a number of problems such as Parliament ’ s inadequate involvement in the process of drawing up foreign policy .
But when we look more closely at it , this great victory appears very dubious .
It goes against every political development of Europe in every direction .
Does anyone , at this early stage , have any idea about the timetable and the transitional periods ?
It would do Russia credit to put this on the agenda , so that these human problems can be solved .
Asylum seekers are fleeing situations of persecution ; they are not attracted by economic factors , but are expelled by regimes that are opposed to freedom .
Transportation and illegal detention of prisoners ( continuation of vote )
In both cases , in fact , we are dealing with organisations designed to overcome the kind of nationalistic tendencies which underlie the veto by the People &apos;s Republic of China .
We do not yet know the implications that the removal of border controls between the Schengen countries will have on the younger generation as regards drug tourism .
As the House is committed to transparency and financial probity , I am sure it will join with me in regretting the action of the Standards Committee .
The rapporteur complains that Europol will not be able to deal with terrorism for another two years .
The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon gave the EU greater powers in the field of judicial and police cooperation in criminal matters , and the report adopted today , on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings , and protecting victims , represents the European legislator &apos;s commitment in this area .
I voted in favour of this report since the principles it brings up are worthy of support .
As it happens , in this connection , nothing – nothing whatsoever – has yet been proven , and there is therefore no merit in this motion of censure .
That is why our approach is right : we are requesting the Commission to put forward a coherent proposal on how we can have a European master plan and how we can introduce best practice so that we can all learn from each other and pursue this expansion effectively .
Together with you , we have held discussions on the future of regional policy after 2006 .
Yet , in order to receive the widest possible support and to be successful in the long term , the fight against terrorism must be conducted in full respect of human rights and in full respect of fundamental freedoms .
As an integral part of the compromise finally reached by the Conciliation Committee and in the interests of clarity , the Commission is making two additional declarations to be included in the protocol to the interconnection directive as finally adopted .
That is why I will be setting up a high @-@ level group to look at the right architecture to ensure that financial markets are suited to the realities of the single market and that supervisors can work together to meet the challenge of cross @-@ border banks .
What has been submitted to us so far says only that previous procedure in competition policy was being followed , in other words , that a decision by the Council would be sufficient , that Parliament would be informed and should then see what happens next .
The Amsterdam Treaty has been signed .
Up until the Amsterdam Treaty , there were about 20 variations of these committee procedures , which created neither clarity in the implementation of legislation nor transparency for the citizens .
We are all responsible for the delays in achieving the Millennium Development Goals , which makes coordinated action by the EU and the UN a matter of urgency .
A significant proportion of the humanitarian aid that the EU provides to Uganda is intended to help the most vulnerable population groups in that part of the country .
In both cases , we are talking about liquids which are consumed at social gatherings or with a meal .
Our common future depends on finding an effective way to ensure integration and sustainability .
The ideals of fairness , asceticism and non @-@ profit making have fallen , unable to contend with such a weak market : this has led to abuse , an increase in wastage , privileges , bureaucracy and inequality and , at the same time , falling profits .
It is important for us to share our various experiences of linguistic diversity and language learning .
However , these problems will not be resolved by not admitting Bulgaria and Romania .
I would therefore call on the Presidency of the Council , in accordance with the comments it has itself made , to ensure that the Council takes account of their special situation .
It states that both spouses should enjoy the same rights when working in the agricultural sector .
Moreover , I would ask them to bring the utmost speed to something that I believe fairly easily unites general consensus in its various aspects , through the discussions that have taken place in the Council , Commission and Parliament , on the committee in which I participated , the Committee for Institutional Affairs , for example .
Commissioner , what is therefore needed is more courage and farsightedness , to overcome the delays that exist in the individual Member States , and thus Parliament and the Commission must show commitment and display vigour and determination to achieve the objectives set out .
The Copenhagen European Council made it clear that the accession of these countries would depend on their fulfilment of the obligations inherent in their participation in the Union .
Her report was to be tabled on Friday morning but the majority of the group chairmen considered that votes should not be cast on this sensitive report on a Friday .
The Council has made substantial changes to the initiatives underlying Eurojust , which made it necessary to consult Parliament again , but , despite this , I do not see Eurojust &apos;s starting date early next year as having been jeopardised .
I am pleased you are going to review the role of these national bodies because , at the moment , I am not convinced that this legislation is practical and workable for citizens .
It is important that this question is down here because I would like to touch on a couple of points that some of my colleagues have raised .
Look at environmental concern as a driving force and not as a brake and as nostalgia for a time which has passed .
However , over the long term , it is clear that humanitarian agencies cannot and must not continue to make up for the weaknesses of the Haitian State or to take its place , and that urgent action must finally be taken to ensure long @-@ term development , in particular , as regards access to healthcare and drinking water and urban renewal .
I therefore feel that this is a real textbook case , which we could still call , forgive me for saying so , a neo @-@ colonialist policy in Africa .
We have every understanding for the underlying idea here , but , given the characteristics of carcinogens , we should not fix unrealistic limits .
The Council therefore called on all parties to abide in full by their commitments .
I wonder whether I might say with real sincerity what a pleasure it is to take part in Question Time when Mrs Neyts is with us because she really does make an effort to answer the question fully and faithfully . That is genuinely appreciated .
I asked this question to find out whether you have discussed this difference between a real deficit and a nominal deficit .
Moreover , the report calls for comprehensive obligations in respect of information and transparency for citizens , Parliament and the Commission .
Mr President , the package under discussion concerns the EU &apos; s accounts for last year , own resources and next year &apos; s budget .
This has allowed us to move on from the allegations of lowering of social standards and threats to the European social model .
I informed the Heads of Government of the ten countries of the results of that monitoring last November and since then we have been working closely with those countries to solve these problems .
In brief , the systems of on @-@ call time also vary greatly .
Secondly , in my view as rapporteur , it is essential that the programme remains market @-@ driven . This provides an excellent opportunity to show that the EU is prepared to help , not hinder , business , as is so often the accusation .
The Commission is finalising its first annual report on Macao and hopes to transmit it shortly to Council and Parliament .
The groups are : the efficiency of the rules , the risk of renationalisation , consistent application of the rules and legal certainty . I will take these very quickly one at a time .
And so to the Constitutional Treaty . The Irish are due to ratify by referendum , but my question is : which text ?
These days there are disappointed women who find that they have been poisoned after such treatment .
This package is inadequate - and I am sure , Commissioner , that you are aware of that today .
This is only one aspect of a much larger problem .
Sometimes the results show that they are right , and sometimes not .
We must now prepare for the time when donations turn from a flood to a trickle , once the glare of the media is turned away from Asia .
We would like environmentally @-@ friendly technology to also be seen as an important factor for growth and employment , and we would highlight the importance of the efficient use of resources .
Recent weeks have also seen the nonsense at the Russian border .
They also have to hear that diplomats in their country do not need visas , and finally , after trying to get a visa several times , because they need one , they get a single @-@ entry visa , despite wanting a Schengen visa , but they did at least get a visa for the country in question .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Tindemans for this excellent report .
We owe this at least , and the conviction of the perpetrators , to the victims and their families .
If this is the case does that mean that anyone , anywhere , can be stopped ?
I shall end by saying , without a trace of irony : may God help us in these difficult times , since we are unable to trust in Europe &apos;s institutions alone .
I would ask you not to exceed your allotted time .
I happily leave it to you to examine this matter .
What have you done instead ?
The next item is questions to the Commission ( B4 @-@ 0272 / 98 ) .
it calls for unconditional aid to the collaborationist &apos; government &apos; of Iraq .
That is unacceptable , and we cannot continue to tolerate such practices .
It remains crucial that Turkey improves its administrative capacity to implement and enforce EU @-@ related legislation .
To end , Prime Minister , I wish to thank you for reminding us of what I feel to be Europe &apos;s ultimate objectives , and if we still cannot agree as to our view of the present , let us at least agree as to the future prospects .
That brings me to the third problem .
– Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , what our group now endorses with the utmost modesty is what we could have done months ago if we had listened to the smaller groups , but history is history and the future belongs to us all , and so we believe it to be a very good thing that we have ended up in our present situation .
This rule stipulated that civil servants could not publish a piece of work without the approval of their superiors . In my opinion , we now live in a society which is sufficiently free and civil servants are sufficiently responsible for this rule to be dispensed with .
I made a proposal in my speech which was not recorded because I had not realized that the Vice @-@ President had asked for silence and I went on speaking .
It is now up to the Member States to take measures , fiscal and other incentives , to remove older , polluting diesels from the roads as quickly as possible .
The Tibetan language can be supplemented by Chinese , but certainly not replaced by it .
Allow it complete independence to get on with its work , allow the individuals to develop fully . I am convinced that then in retrospect you will not only applaud the appointment of this group , but will also appreciate properly the work it has done .
To discourage smoking , especially amongst young people , a drastic increase in tobacco prices would be the ideal measure .
I particularly welcome some of the amendments proposed by the committee , which state that the right to refugee status should be recognised rather than granted : refugee status is a legal right , not the gift of a benevolent regime .
The issue we should be raising instead is the reorganisation of the Court of Justice .
in writing . - British Conservative MEPs have voted against this resolution as the issue the text deals with is one which is wholly a matter for internal affairs of one Member State and thus has no bearing at an EU level .
On the question of the possible suspension of Zimbabwe &apos;s privileges under the Lomé Convention , there could be grounds for suspension if the Commission considers , after consulting thoroughly with Member States , that this would not be counterproductive at this stage before the elections .
However , instead of taking bold measures to at least limit the unaccountability of the monopolies , decisions are being taken to strengthen competition on the electricity and natural gas markets , liberalise the energy market and hand the entire strategic sector of the production , transmission and distribution of energy over to the private sector .
And these five countries will be the first to suffer the consequences of an uncontrolled upheaval .
We want to use our fisheries agreements to help third countries manage stocks in a sustainable manner .
It is difficult to accept that a livestock farmer toiling day in day out is the victim of a market game which is played tens of thousands of kilometres away on the computers of companies which have nothing to do with agriculture , but have sufficient money to destabilise global markets .
It has rightly been pointed out that Mrs Fouque wished to vote against , but this is not taken into account in the result of the vote , which , may I remind you , was decided by a single vote .
Incidentally , it is no longer true that China , India and other countries like them are competing on the low @-@ value @-@ added goods and services .
Question No 39 by ( H @-@ 0807 / 99 ) :
In a society that is now dominated by a globalised economic market , the Community institutions have a duty to encourage development cooperation , in a world in which three billion human beings live on less than two dollars a day and over a billion survive on one dollar .
They are not human rights in the traditional sense of the word .
This is why it is also extremely important for control and sanctions to be harmonised at international level .
The European Union , through its High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy , should make freedom of religion and belief and the security of religious communities , including Christians , a priority in the Union &apos;s international relations .
A world where making money is the sole objective will not see this as a priority .
Animal manure cannot be the only cause of nitrate pollution , and it is completely unreasonable to tell farmers to restrict its use if we do not know the other causes .
That is the effect .
I obviously understand the concern among Members that the Commission &apos;s position should nevertheless be a coherent , harmonious one .
Export subsidies have not been radically reduced .
. ( DA ) The Danish Social Democrats today voted for the three reports indicated .
But after the ferocious talibanisation of Afghan society over the last few years , and given the position of the country where warlordism is still rife , it is going to be some time before we can promote the sort of strong gender policies we would like to see .
( PT ) Mr President , Vice @-@ President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I shall start with the report by Mrs Roure , which I once again support in its efforts to reach a political agreement on the proposal for a Framework Decision on the protection of personal data in the framework of the third pillar that is not based on the lowest common denominator , a minimum level of data protection and serious shortcomings .
The next item is the recommendation for second reading ( A4 @-@ 0194 / 96 ) on behalf of the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy , on the common position adopted by the Council ( C40203 / 96 @-@ 94 / 0272 ( COD ) ) with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive on energy efficiency requirements for household electrical refrigerators , freezers and their combinations ( Rapporteur : Mr Macartney ) .
It also promotes a participative approach which involves the private sector and civil society , getting poverty reduction underway . It streamlines cooperation instruments and creates a new framework for economic and trade cooperation by concluding new agreements designed to include all of these provisions in the world trade system gradually and harmoniously .
We need to strengthen those directives , so that we strengthen the position of workers when restructuring is carried out .
Budgetary stability , the cross @-@ border coordination of pensions , the development of minimum guarantees and equal rights for women and men are only some of the issues which should be the subject of deliberations in every Member State .
Thank you , Madam Rapporteur .
. Let me say at the outset that the Commission very much appreciates the work of the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children .
The MOX facility at Sellafield means more nuclear reprocessing , not less , and nobody in the British Government and BNFL can deny this .
I shall try to say a few things in reply to the very accurate comments by all the Members and the rapporteurs and spokesmen .
At least 32 % of the total amount of aid must be allocated to social measures such as retraining for fishermen who have lost their jobs or part @-@ financing of early retirement schemes .
Mr President , the Arctic issue is important and it has now also come before us here .
It is also important to increasingly include Russia in the transatlantic dialogue .
The object of this agreement is to make it easier to issue visas for a planned stay of no more than 90 days in duration for nationals of the Russian Federation travelling to EU Member States , or for citizens of the European Union travelling to the Russian Federation .
How are you going to deal with the IPPC Directive on industrial emissions ?
I very much agree with Mr Watson &apos;s wise words about those countries : &apos; we take their goods or we take their people &apos; .
My approach on the issue of sexual orientation discrimination , as well as regarding discrimination against any minority , is consistent with EU legislation and other international human rights law and with the views of many of my electorate in Romania , as well as with my beliefs .
I say &apos; should &apos; no longer occur because I think one thing we are familiar with in all countries is the zealousness of parking attendants .
I would add that , based on past experience , the cases most representative of this situation might be , for example : the untimely and unjustified prohibition of importing products from other Member States ; measures establishing or restoring import formalities , such as licences or technical approvals ; destruction of large quantities of products from other Member States , for example , on the roads , in shopping centres or in warehouses ; or even the immobilization of products by not permitting access to the national territory or movement within it , for example , blockading means of transport at the borders , on the motorways , or at the ports or airports .
I see a different , more fundamental , problem .
I think it was Mr Libicki who highlighted the need for aid at local level .
No fewer than 837 drugs have been designated &apos; orphan medicinal products &apos; in the US over the past decade . Research and experimentation on these products - which we are discussing today - has been facilitated in various ways , contributing to the identification and knowledge of previously unknown etiologies and hence their treatments .
This is not the same as accepting that development cooperation should simply deteriorate into becoming some sort of social gap @-@ filling .
There can be no doubt about the Commission &apos;s position on this matter .
Let us make it clear : we are not making an exception for any sector of our industry .
We use our experts to go to Member States or to carry out seminars to teach the Member States how to best implement it .
It must not , then , be made responsible either for the distribution of aid ( a function of the Member States ) or for arbitration in competition disputes , a task which should be given to a specialized body under the overriding political control of the Council , as described in Article 93 ( 2 ) of the Treaty .
And unfortunately , it is not the first time that there has been an attempt to genuinely dismantle , as we could describe it , the prerogatives of our institution , which could be seen as a dangerous precedent .
Worse still , more elusive than the rogue States are the stateless terrorist organisations whose murderous folly does not correspond to any logic .
There will be the aid provided by the Spanish authorities .
A second problem about which there is too little talk is the overall loss of competitiveness and the ever @-@ widening competition divide between the North and the South .
History shows us how the countries of the Balkans were for too long at the mercy of the interests and schemes of the great European powers , as well as of Turkey , which you may or may not , depending on your point of view , regard as having been one of them .
An increasing number of companies are relocating , taking advantage of reduced labour costs in a number of countries , particularly China and India , with a damaging effect on countries that respect workers &apos; rights .
Global discussions are obviously required in this case , and not only with the United States .
Yet the Commission , ever faithful to its nature and its habits , cannot stop taking every opportunity to overwhelm the states and their citizens with new directives and pernickety little rules , which often bear little relation to real local conditions .
The Commission will evaluate the results of the pilot projects financed during the year and intends to return with a proposal for a programme lasting several years in 1998 .
in writing . - ( PT ) The directive in question concerns emissions from agricultural tractors and provides for a quantitative modification , without altering the environmental objectives previously set out in Directive 2000 / 25 / EC .
We currently have a directive which only partially overlaps with the new legislative framework adopted in the middle of 2008 .
This is urgently required from the viewpoint of the competitiveness of our industry , as our companies &apos; competitors already benefit from a liberalised environment and lower sales costs .
Finally , Chancellor Schüssel , it has been most welcome to see your approach to opening up the Council as regards codecision and in inviting parliamentarians to your meetings .
And in this respect I must firstly point out that we are working on determining the immediate response elements for the possible carrying out of the Petersberg tasks agreed in Helsinki .
If we want the decreasing confidence in the EU and its institutions to be restored , we must transcend petty conflicts of interest and engage in European @-@ style politics to meet the not insignificant challenges that face us .
Substantially , what that means is that the EU can import wine diluted with 7 % of added water or flavoured with wood chips , practices that our producers , of course , are absolutely forbidden to use .
The chosen legal basis is unacceptable ; we ask to be consulted under the ordinary legislative procedure and to be kept informed of developments in the work of the UN Sanctions Committee .
Pakistan &apos;s trade with the Union consists mainly of textiles and clothing products , which according to information from the Commission accounted for 73.7 % of Pakistani exports to the Union in 2009 .
A situation must be avoided in which airline companies are enabled to evade their obligations by intentionally failing to provide information or by disinformation .
I am not so pessimistic .
We must provide the prospect of European Union membership to the whole of the Balkan region , including Serbia and Kosovo .
There is also an urgent need to establish goals to be achieved in realistic and measurable stages in the fields of intervention envisaged in the Community framework strategy on gender equality , in order to ensure real practical progress in all areas , bearing in mind that there are still many infringements of legislation on equal treatment between men and women .
Research , education , democracy and participation are all preconditions for taking joint responsibility .
For the first time we have made use of the right of initiative and I fully support Mr Rothley , not only in his personal appeal to you , Madam President , but also in his appeal to Commissioner Monti to continue in this new direction .
In view of the importance of this Fund for certain regions and countries of the Union , and without waiting for proposals from the Commission , does the Council think it should include the continuity of the cohesion fund in the financial perspectives as from 1999 ?
What happened to the great debate on flexicurity ? Your big idea for revitalising Europe &apos;s economy , which fizzled out before we failed even to define it ?
Violations of fundamental human rights in Belarus are something to which we have been accustomed for many years .
Cooperation with the French Presidency and the Council was very fruitful .
We showed common determination .
And indeed , as Ms Bowles has said , we do have policies towards those .
We must not neglect innovation in industry and business , a climate friendly approach to production and the organisation of public transport .
The situation must be resolved internationally , so that the requirements imposed would be real and would apply to all those sailing in the Baltic Sea , not only to vessels from EU Member States .
I congratulate the President for domestic reasons .
We are trying to combine efforts at the European level and the national level so that they will reinforce each other and so that Europe can really become a fully competitive information society and , at the same time , an information society which includes everyone .
We shall most certainly see whether the 221 million that the Commission has set aside for this is sufficient .
At this point , I would clarify , for the avoidance of all misunderstanding , that the support mechanism for Greece , despite any delays , demonstrates this solidarity and you should be in no doubt as to the fact that we recognise it .
They come from the specific EDF budget , which is why I say that it would be rather difficult to transfer EDF appropriations to aid for Kosovo , because they are not part of the Community budget .
The United Nations , through its office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights , has this year established an information system in Sierra Leone , aimed at gathering information from women and girls in camps for internally displaced persons across the country , to determine the scope of sexual violence against women and girls .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , at a time when the European Union is called on to reform its common agricultural policy , ensuring consistency between agricultural and external trade policy becomes all the more crucial .
We move that paragraph 121 , which puts undue emphasis on the interests of European fisheries , should be deleted .
As regards North Korea , at this point I would simply appeal to them to return to the negotiating table , and the Commission should examine whether Europe should take on an active role in this respect .
I am delighted by this .
The lack of a method of calculating infrastructure costs is detrimental to fair competition and encourages discriminatory treatment of users .
Parliament &apos;s most important tightening @-@ up of the proposal involved a future total ban on &apos; cannibalism &apos; in the handling of animal feed .
Furthermore , it complains that in the assessment of strategies and priorities , the Commission and the Ukraine recipients are not using the same criteria .
The subject matter of the report is extremely important as it deals with the prospect of having a Euro @-@ Mediterranean Union of states bound together through friendship and cooperation and aiming at the common goal of achieving peace , stability and prosperity for their citizens .
During the summit , we will take all the necessary decisions that it is possible to take .
But we are not interfering in someone else &apos;s business , it is our business .
The next item is the joint debate on oral questions on the transfer of passenger data :
On two previous occasions I have talked about the employment situation .
The Minutes of yesterday &apos;s sitting have been distributed .
This should , moreover , not be at the expense of development aid for poorer countries , as is the case in the current proposal .
Next month we also expect to conclude an update of the Guidelines on the Death Penalty , which coincides with the tenth anniversary of the guidelines .
Thirdly , we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law .
Those who recognise treaty reform as a priority should ask themselves today especially : is it worth taking a firmer stance on Poland and the United Kingdom ; is it worth placing a question mark over the outcome of many years of negotiation ?
I understand that the Council Presidency was not invited and was told there was no need for it to be here .
The GUE / NGL Group considers these amendments to be fundamental in order for such a positive report to be one hundred percent positive .
I am particularly pleased that the proposal on behalf of the Committee on International Trade is a considerable improvement on the original document , notably in relation to how to include developing countries in the world trade system , and the importance to be attached to the liberalisation of certain non @-@ essential services and , importantly , to the solutions being proposed to reduce agricultural protection .
We believe they reflect the overall balance of opinion in this House about the importance of maintaining an entirely consistent approach to our work in this absolutely crucial area , and a consistent approach to the work of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in the areas of electronic commerce and in creating the internal market as a whole .
For me , the issue is not that of knowing whether gas can be purchased from the Devil .
Refusing all discussion was never a recipe for resolving a conflict .
If it happens , I fear it may have implications for the financial assistance we provide . That is already the subject of criticism , and we want better scrutiny of it .
LIFE is returning to the south .
It is our obligation to put Europeans first when it comes to employment , social protection , policies relating to the family , and retirement policy .
In summary , this is the reason for my vote .
Despite your efforts , Mr Vice @-@ President , the Commission has still not always realised that .
Europe gets beaten about because it does not connect with its citizens and here we have a golden opportunity - and I direct this to the Council - to connect with people who have a real problem and who are coming to their MEPs for a solution .
Disputes between Russia , Norway , the US and Canada obviously have a geopolitical significance as well .
Mr President , the quarrel between the USA and the EU runs very deep .
In order to strengthen the European Union &apos;s action in a number of third countries , the Council Working Group on Human Rights is also currently preparing a strategy for a more effective application of the guidelines on torture adopted by the Union in 2001 , while analysing information about cases of torture sent in by European Union heads of mission in different parts of the world .
The next item is the report ( A5 @-@ 0272 / 2004 ) by Mr Hatzidakis , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the Commission Communication : the Third report on economic and social cohesion .
Mr Maaten now hopes , by means of a propaganda campaign , to be able to make up the shortfall of respect for the people ’ s opinion .
In addition , there is no definition of the various rearing methods and every animal will certainly be fed using various methods , rather than one and the same method , during its lifetime .
This will strengthen the reliability of the budget as a basis for the EU ’ s operations for the year .
We are therefore confident that the Commission will make progress simultaneously in the areas of competitiveness and of creating an internal market that will guarantee growth , and also in terms of developing a legislative environment in the social sphere based on European values .
Therefore , the Commission undertook to present a report on the functioning of the Interinstitutional Agreement at the end of 2009 . The Commission also undertook to present a full , wide @-@ ranging budget review covering all aspects of EU spending , including the common agricultural policy , and of resources , including the United Kingdom rebate , in 2008 / 2009 .
It does not make sense to keep rules that are entirely obsolete in place .
We would be forgiven for thinking over these last months that Europe has only one transatlantic relationship , so often do we use that term to describe the link between our Union and the United States of America .
With the best will in the world , I cannot share this view .
Mr President , I am pleased with the report by Mrs de Veyrac , which has the great merit of clearly proposing the principle of adopting a blacklist of unsafe , even dangerous , airlines . In view of recent repeated disasters resulting from the defectiveness of certain aircraft , it is essential that we act to identify them and ban them from flying .
The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon .
Not all of these countries are equally unpredictable , but the proliferation of nuclear weapons has , unfortunately , not declined but increased since the existence of the Non @-@ Proliferation Treaty .
In the present economic environment it will not be easy to borrow for new equipment and training .
The people of Omagh suffered a lot .
Many thanks .
Additionally , I would like to stress two further elements because it is never the case that you can rely only on imports .
( HU ) Madam President , as a Hungarian , the Hungarian Presidency is a great pleasure for me and I wish the Council every success , yet this speech about Serbia &apos;s EU accession gave me a slight feeling of sadness and a sense that something is lacking .
Secondly - and you , Mr Commissioner , can be sure that you will hear from us when the time comes to consider the successor to ALTENER II in the energy framework programme . We expect that there will be a significant increase there as well .
We must not allow a repetition of the events of last year , when the human rights debate foundered because the extreme right used their votes to prevent the House from adopting a report on the human rights situation .
If , rather than lead , you merely lead astray , and up the wrong garden path at that , i.e. up the national path which hankers after the past rather than down the glorious path which will take us forward , then you run the risk of going down in history as the gravedigger of Europe , because you could not and would not explain to your citizens that the European Union plays an indispensable role in the age of globalisation and that this European Union is therefore in dire need of radical democratisation and practical application of the principle of subsidiarity .
Scientific evidence proves that British beef is safe .
In that way , the particular level of social protection is related more clearly to immigration and asylum policy .
The safeguarding of international law , democracy and human rights is not mentioned at all in the Commission &apos;s proposal .
We must coordinate our efforts .
The best possible result could therefore be achieved if notification concerned only those projects that have obtained the necessary authorisations and permits or those for which a final investment decision has been taken .
By adopting the 2011 budget , during the December part @-@ session , we showed the Council was right .
Even today , in our civilised societies , discriminatory practices remain commonplace .
Mr Poettering , I will be able to read you the communication as soon as I receive it .
For the Commission to entrust ARTM , an international association under Belgian law , with the financial management of the MED projects without any legal basis and without obtaining the opinion of the legal service or of financial control , for the management board members also to be managers of the technical assistance agencies and to be involved in awarding some project funds without tenders and thereby secure themselves a large slice of the cake , that is to say fat contracts , is to say the least an overlapping of interests , as is also the view of the Court of Auditors and UCLAF .
But it would have been unfair to have sprung it on him at such short notice . As he said , Parliament has always been at the forefront of the fight against fraud and we see that not only in what he referred to , the creation of the UCLAF Unit , but also its endowment with both staff and resources in order to do the job .
One result of this , amongst others , is the abolition of independent education , and the European Humanities University has already been mentioned .
People in our society are no longer viewed as a whole .
Few mainstream politicians dared to follow Salmaan Taseer &apos;s lead and suggest a reform of the blasphemy laws and even fewer will be able to do so now .
It is these contracts that account for the greatest number of cross @-@ border transactions .
Secondly , in this unknown situation , this first in economic and political history , that of a centralized monetary policy with decentralized budgetary policies , how can we ensure that those policies jigsaw harmoniously and efficiently to ensure growth and employment for the whole of the European Union ?
It is also important – and here I would cite Iran as an example – that we join together in preventing new dangers and new risks from rearing their heads .
If several thousand refugees are forced to take refuge in neighbouring countries , the governments of Tirana and Skopje will face serious problems .
I would like to thank everyone , including Mr Brok , for their reports .
Commission . ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in February , the Commission debated the priorities for the European budget for next year and had the opportunity to discuss these priorities in detail with the European Parliament both here in plenary and , more importantly , in the Committee on Budgets and in the various trialogues between the Commission , the European Parliament and the Council which have taken place since .
I would ask the Commissioner to share her opinion with us on this point , also with regard to the programme which was launched in connection with the European Year of Languages and which was very clearly defined .
I would therefore call on the Commission and the Council to pay particular attention to closing the loopholes in the internal market legislation .
I should add , by way of a reminder , that he won 90 % of votes , but that the elections were neither free nor democratic .
Finally , I can assure you - as I have already said - that I will bring all your comments to bear in the Council &apos;s continued deliberations .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I will be brief because it was a very long debate .
The debate is closed .
This directive is a major first in the history of civilisation , as it is the first time in the existence of the law ( strength is sufficient for the strong , the law is made for the weak ) that a brutal departure has been made from the principle of territoriality of the law .
Please forget it and let the countries of Europe make their contributions to the whole .
On the Coast of Death and in the Rias Baixas and the Rias Altas , these misfortunes are remembered even more sharply .
Mr President , I am just taking over the minute allotted to my colleague Mrs Ahern , who has unfortunately been unable to get here on time .
Indeed , Mr Schüssel mentioned it himself just now .
However , the concrete solutions must clearly be accepted by the Member States .
So we do not need Parliament .
This reform process will create the conditions required for economic recovery .
Some of them , such as Amendment No 17 which concerns payment by instalments , have absolutely no link with the guarantee system .
Like Parliament , the Commission believes that the framework decision , insofar as it refers to services under Article 50 of the founding treaty of the European Community , should have Article 50 as its legal basis .
Mr President , I welcome the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council .
We , as Members of the European Parliament , insist on this .
Mr President , I think we should remember how the multiethnic Macedonian population coped with the conflict in Kosovo .
Economic studies have shown that , in the OECD for example , there is no link between the level of tax in a country and economic growth .
The third energy package fills many of the structural gaps from the past .
It is clear that there exists no single and global solution for eliminating tax fraud .
We have to ask ourselves here what is going wrong in our societies and what is going wrong in the Islamic environment for these people to become radicalised .
For example , we know of the letter by Pierre Sané , the secretary of Amnesty International , to the Commission and Council at the end of last year , and also the threats in the last few days to Akin Birdal and the Turkish Human Rights Association , the persistent declarations by the Turkish authorities on the situation of the Kurdish people and the Cyprus conflict , and many other matters .
This requires coherent behaviour , yet local leaders of the Popular Party are throwing more fuel on the raging fire and boycotting the attempts of other institutions to put this out .
We shall obviously be voting in favour .
The Euro @-@ Mediterranean Free Trade Area , as has been mentioned , is gradually taking shape and will act as an interface between an increasingly globalised world and Europe &apos;s open , inclusive regionalism .
We need to conduct sound preliminary studies , and I am pleased to hear about the plans to apply Seveso II to offshore platforms .
The lead committee , at least , has voted unanimously in favour of such a move .
China &apos; s entry into the WTO will , arguably , have as far @-@ reaching an effect as anything which will take place in Seattle .
My third and final point is that if we form alliances , in particular this alliance against terrorism , an alliance which we must and should form , we will more often find ourselves facing a contradiction or conflict between our strategic concerns on the one hand and our human rights concerns on the other .
Mr President , I believe that tomorrow &apos;s vote will truly be a litmus test of whether we regard EMAS as an instrument of ecological progress or as a mere sham .
Therefore , Commissioner , we are relying on this interinstitutional dialogue to put the finishing touches to a reform which we are all hoping for and which we believe will lead us to a successful conclusion under your direction and with our cooperation .
Nevertheless , I think it is very important this year that we continue to support the spirit of UN reform , that we recognise the positive role played by EU Member States in the Human Rights Council and recognise too that the process of peer review is only just beginning and that to do it openly , comprehensively and effectively is the best way we can support that institution .
If we decide on them all the same , the political landscape of the EU is likely to change in the future and probably not to Europe &apos;s advantage .

We are also concerned that , in preparing for the Barcelona Summit , the Commission , the Council and Parliament have done so little to take account of the candidate countries &apos; needs and interests .
In that way , all types of friction and inequality may at last be overcome , for the sake of the unified project of a Europe particularly conscious of the problems faced by minorities and by the most disadvantaged groups in the least developed regions .
There is a whole problem of credibility and trust that is well equated in the explanation of reasons when the warning is given that people may have the idea that the euro is just for the rich , or that it will only be of use to them , whether at consumer or company level , with the small and medium @-@ sized businesses having greater difficulties with regard to administrative and accounting management and managing the costs of introducing a single currency in several countries .
Mr President , Mrs Schroedter &apos;s report calls for a more interdependent Europe , where rich regions give poorer regions more help .
Finally , what proportion of these resources has already been set aside for these purposes ?
The strategy is there , we have targets , a timescale and a convergence policy .
Mr President . I acknowledge the first coordination act of the enlarged 25 @-@ member group under the Dutch presidency .
I should like to point out that over ten different options were on Council &apos;s table in April 2006 , not one of which has any chance of success , either now or , probably , in the future .
I understand from a letter which I have just found on the fax that the association of European railway companies is also worried about this .
Safeguarding sound government finances is a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and achieving strong sustainable growth which is conducive to employment creation .
The challenge of ensuring the respect for fundamental rights and freedoms , while also integrating and guaranteeing security in Europe , is addressed here in what we think to be a comprehensive way .
This view is also held by the European Monetary Institute .
It is important that environmental targets are achieved as cost @-@ effectively as possible .
What is happening here is not worthy of a democracy .
We want this legislation to enter into force earlier than the compromise made with the Council .
The Constitutional Treaty does not promote these aims .
We can stop Europe , but we cannot stop the world developing and there is therefore unanimous agreement in our committee - first , to ask for the budget to be restored to the Commission proposal - which was already a compromise because we would have needed more - and then , to find additional resources for the new policies under the Lisbon Treaty , namely the space policy and ITER .
If we get it right , it should be a mutual benefit .
Madam President , of course it is important that financial checks are made on the operation of the Structural Funds .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , freedom is a criterion that should always be taken into consideration when making important decisions of any kind .
It is not the case that the US and the European Union agree on every area .
The specific reference in this resolution to East Timor , on the initiative of the PPE Group , is a timely one .
If it is a pure natural yoghurt , that is made from milk and nothing else , then it is a milk product and it is not classified as a good not covered by Annex I to the Treaty . So we have not been paying export refunds any more for natural yoghurt for years , but we still have to grant them for flavoured yoghurts .
However , the lack of a commitment to minimum legal safeguards is the deciding factor in my voting &quot; no &quot; .
Many of the main themes included in the report presented today by Mrs Van den Burg on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee will also be reflected in the Commission ’ s Green Paper on its future financial services policy .
Farmers need stability to be able to plan production and investment .
Please ask yourselves whether it is likely that the United States will suddenly double the amount of change it is prepared to make and do so by June , as the resolution demands ?
This was the first time it had been introduced and it was a positive move .
The Marco Polo II programme is , in this respect , certainly capable of meeting the requirements of business and industry on the one hand , but also those of the environmentalists on the other , meeting the needs of the environment and all that is associated with that ; that is one reason why I was very glad that it was possible relatively quickly to draft an extended and adapted Marco Polo programme .
That is awful .
Poverty makes these people &apos;s misery even worse .
It is also worthy of note that Germany did not share its pre @-@ eminence in the field of machine tools , but this cooperation did nevertheless produce good results until the predominant ideology , which was one not so much of liberalism as of free trade , ended up privatising , in France and elsewhere , the great industrial flagships , particularly in aerospace , and the companies that benefited from this were English @-@ speaking , based in the Netherlands and subject to Dutch law .
Allow me to begin with a phrase used by Mr Verhofstadt .
It is interesting that the Council representative has not denied the conclusions drawn by the Swedish prime minister , that EMU could mean that the EU would develop into a State .
Secondly , this regulation does not , in essence , call for any statements on aid legislation .
We should resort to legislative initiatives only if the sector proves incapable of adopting efficient measures .
Electricity will continue to be a scarce and vulnerable product in the future too , certainly now that fossil fuels are running out and as global warming continues .
Hopefully , we will reach consensus with the Commission and the Council regarding objectives .
The question we are left with today is : what will come of this ?
We also believe that the people of Sudan , in both North and South , need to take their fate into their own hands .
It is now also beginning to be recognized as an important question in the applicant countries too . It is their young women who are affected .
But in other respects , it may be that the situation we have now is fairer than that envisaged in the regulation . This would indeed be the case if some of the amendments tabled were approved , in particular the extensive and excessively detailed Amendment No 38 that covers everything relating to the grading of assistants , the corresponding remuneration systems and the unequal social security schemes .
Clarification is also needed on the all too vague area of the possible exchange of data with third countries .
Mr President , let me begin by saying thank you to the rapporteur , Mr Wijsenbeek , for the many years of work he has done on this matter .
However , my second point is most definitely one for the Council .
Mr President , first of all , may I ask you to give our regards to Commissioner Dimas and convey the thanks of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) for his efforts over recent years .
Madam President , it is high time we started using the enormous wealth of knowledge and experience that already exists , instead of constantly setting up new bodies with new personnel who have to start from scratch again .
It is , then , the desire for effectiveness that motivates us , and the Commission must not be seen as any less interested in the joint effort towards winning the battle to keep the public properly informed .
In principle , I agree with the Commission that the competitiveness of European farming on the world market needs to be increased .
I know there is a proposal to purchase this building , and although it makes financial sense here and now in terms of the savings we will make in the immediate future , I am concerned about the long @-@ term suitability of the building : it hardly meets our requirements now , so what is it going to be like six years down the line ?
We are talking about us , not Austria .
Its closure might have serious consequences for the treatment of torture victims in Turkey , since no one else can take up the HRFT ’ s work .
That is not just a problem in this case but a general one .
With our current waste material technologies , these substances , when burned or disposed of , will sooner or later find their way into our bodies , accumulate and cause severe diseases .
Of course , the Council is very concerned with the application of the provisions of the Treaty and the secondary legislation .
the reconstruction of infrastructure destroyed in the war ; -the return of all refugees and displaced persons to their homes ; the creation , that is , of conditions which will encourage them to return , because fine words alone will not get these people back to their homes , to the places where they lived peacefully in earlier years ; -clearance of the minefields which are endangering the lives of many thousands of people in Bosnia ; -the placing of priority on the social rehabilitation of the people , with emphasis on ensuring that the appropriations are not frittered away by businessmen and the various opportunists who will be looking for the main chance ; -fair distribution of the appropriations among all of the peoples - Serbs , Croats , Muslims - without special conditions and requirements.We would view any attempt to link this aid to political conditions , to a demand for the establishment of any particular social organization model , as a new manifestation of inhumanity on the part of the Union and its institutions .
We must , though , ensure that Europe becomes effective where it has not been before .
A society which loses respect for the most vulnerable in its midst , which is indifferent to the fate of its children , which looks on while children are turned into merchandise , which allows these sinister creatures , the scum and the dross of society , to assault its children before its very eyes ; a society which starts to rot so that it is not even appalled when in some dark corner , in its shadowy underbelly things go on which defy belief , and then quickly turns back to the day &apos;s business - because that is happening at the moment in the European Union although the facts are known ; a society which takes the easy way out by saying Dutroux is a Belgian affair , we do not have that kind of thing ; a society which will not face the fact that it has signaled its own demise if it cannot protect its children from perverts ; a society like that has got to take its courage in both hands and say that the fight against child abuse , the protection of children and the chance of a decent life from the day of their birth must be the common aim of all those in authority .
That is why I would ask you , Mrs Bonino , to accept paragraph 8 of the resolution in particular and to give it special attention .
Madam President , the problem with the Tacis regulation is not a new one .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Surján for the positive outcome of the negotiations .
Some simply refuse to do so .
What we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax , which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at European level .
This implies that regional policy must be taken as the starting @-@ point , and strengthening the regions really means creating genuine stability .
Not everything is hunky @-@ dory in EU @-@ Russia relations , of course .
A portion of the budget is to be used for assessing European employment policy .
It does , however , give the European people an unwarranted sense of security .
So please do not try to argue that we need public broadcasting because of its political impartiality .
In the occupied territories , in Palestine , we are witnessing a difficult situation , with violence amongst Palestinians and also renewed violence between Israel and Palestine .
Mr Rod has raised one of the most complex issues in the field of motor racing : the choice of Formula 1 circuits and the setting of the Grand Prix calendar .
Although we remain firmly opposed to the death penalty , the fact that the case has been sent for retrial is at least positive and we hope that the women will be given a fair trial in line with international human rights standards .
Although unemployment has already gradually reduced , it is still at an unacceptable level throughout the Community , given the forecasts for 2001 of 8 % unemployment among the working population . This is particularly true at the outer edges of the Community , in other words in the most remote regions .
I listened to the same debate that the previous speaker listened to yesterday , and I can be nothing other than horrified by what I heard : a bizarre bidding war for an agency that does not need to exist .
It is essential that the Union also considers its own role in this manner .
Our task is now to extend the Union &apos;s attention and action to a large number of other aspects of higher education , most importantly encouraging the dissemination of the good practices of some countries in all the other countries of the Union , promoting the right of all the citizens to study irrespective of their financial situation , and this can be achieved by expanding public higher education , which is the only form of education which attracts investments that are not subject to the mindset of quick profits and which is therefore able to guarantee all the citizens access to higher education , which is necessary for the renewal of the ruling classes .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , allow me to express my pleasure at the fact that the Commissioner is also dealing with this issue , and I hope this will be reflected not only in his brief address but also in the work of the Commission , because we naturally have a duty to ensure that the actions of the European Commission duly reflect our wishes and ideas .
These are guidelines that we have always fought for , although they have not always been understood or accepted .
We have listened to each other , and I think we are now in a situation in which it is also apparent that arguments have played a helpful role .
The European Parliament , which for years has been committed to upholding the fundamental rights of all citizens , already adopted a resolution on the issue in 2001 .
The creation of a European legislative framework covering unfair commercial practices based on an appropriate level of harmonisation and aimed at clear and effective protection of consumers within the European Union will result in enhanced consumer confidence , an increase in international trade and will allow businesses to compete in a situation of legal clarity .
I cannot go to all of them .
Therefore , we must respect the right of all European Union citizens without exception to move freely .
We have to be careful about how we proceed with the debate .
Coming from Scotland , I have a vested interest in this subject .
Mr President , I also voted against the Liese report .
Mr President , I would like first of all to congratulate the rapporteurs .
This type of speculative behaviour has a direct impact on people &apos;s standard of living and can contribute to political instability .
But it is proving to be an area fraught with tensions .
The Committee on Fisheries believes that this could even create problems with regard to the Union &apos;s legal obligations in this field , and we are therefore calling for the initial sums to be restored .
Without them we would not be able to have the proposal that is here on the table today .
Finally , as the honourable Member will be aware , it is the Council &apos;s view that in order to safeguard the important differences between the languages and cultures within and between Member States , the political direction in the field of culture must respect the principle of subsidiarity .
I know that he has put a great deal of himself into it and has been personally involved in the work on it , so I warmly congratulate him on this document .
It matters because of the potential in our own European Union and in the whole of central and eastern Europe .
This programme will enable us to give financial backing to the instruments we have , such as the open method of coordination , the drafting of legislation and efforts to monitor its application , the exchange of good practices and the action of non @-@ governmental organisations .
This is in addition to the role of the Member States and is no substitute for individual Member States &apos; membership of the United Nations , but it would give our foreign policy a higher profile , it would increase our scope for action and above all be more transparent to the public .
Mr President , firstly I wish to congratulate Mr Tillich on his excellent presentation of the Commission &apos;s budget and thank both Mr Brinkhorst and Mr Fabra Valles for the kind words introduced in the supplementary and amending budget .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , the decision that we are about to take is a very important one .
Madam President , as Mrs Guy @-@ Quint stated a moment ago , there is always something predictable about debates such as today ’ s .
What is less clear is how exactly this can be achieved .
The medium @-@ sized ports will be grateful to you - and to us - if this is done .
The reason I voted for it is the fact that the content of the new regulation is really important , significantly improving the existing regulation .
This increase in the number of tasks seems paradoxically to have weakened its prestige and certainly has not helped , which speaks volumes .
I will be delighted to take charge of those papers .
Otherwise I , like the rest of my Group , will have to vote against the report .
It is within this context that the Commission , the European Parliament and the Member States must take a stand and design the future multiannual financial framework .
Furthermore , cooperation with other European programmes still appears to be inadequate , which is also a significant shortcoming .
Europe must accept its responsibility ; that is to say , we certainly first need crystal @-@ clear definitions so that we can say that one thing is healthy and the other unhealthy , one thing harmful and the other harmless .
The differences in contract law between the various Member States are slowing down SMEs wishing to carry out cross @-@ border transactions .
Thanks also to those who do not appreciate it .
Simply referring to a code of good conduct and to the need for transparency is not a sufficient guarantee for the future .
This alone makes it paramount that we let this part of the EU budget through today .
Madam President , the resolution the European Parliament is preparing to vote on , contained in Mr Kreissl @-@ Dörfler &apos;s excellent report , is of great importance , for reasons of method and substance .
But we differ with this resolution in relation to an EU seat and changes to the veto system .
Secondly , by reallocating the appropriations lost due to the Ν + 2 rule .
Secondly , can you confirm that the Director General of Eurostat , Mr Rademacher , expressed serious doubts about the data coming from Athens as long ago as 2004 and 2005 ?
With regard to the current situation in Chechnya , I would like to stress certain aspects .
However , I also have to say that it is the large companies and some of the Member States that have succeeded here , and not the far @-@ sighted European politicians .
I wanted to mention the example of the Democratic Republic of Congo because this was a very recent experience for me .
Firstly , with regard to combating poverty : many Member States have questioned whether the EU actually has the competence to combat poverty and to set specific poverty targets .
It is true that the Palestinian suicide attacks are despicable - we all know that - but what did Mr Sharon do during the periods in which there were no attacks ?
I think the Commissioner knows what I mean .
We have come up with a framework for a common strategy and put forward concrete proposals and measures .
Many colleagues have also raised questions about the desirability of separating the ex ante responsibility for budget control from the ex post responsibility for budget implementation or formulation within the Commission .
This report , though , is very selective – after all , you do not talk about rope in the house of a man who hanged himself .
It would be preferable not to have two opposing fora - one economic and one social , one governmental and one civil - each calling for completely different political orientations for the future .
They also encouraged consumers to familiarise themselves more with prices labelled in euros and to continue to carefully compare competitors &apos; prices , particularly between now and the end of the year and during the dual circulation period .
The delegations from the Pan @-@ African Parliament and our Parliament met last week to prepare a joint declaration .
I voted in favour of the report by my Swedish fellow Member Jan Andersson , under the simplified procedure , which confirms the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council repealing Council Decision 85 / 368 / EEC on the comparability of vocational training qualifications between the Member States of the European Community , which called for the Member States and the Commission to cooperate in drawing up Community job descriptions in specified occupations , and then match vocational training qualifications recognised in the Member States with the agreed job descriptions .
I think this is an important sign : this is a responsible Parliament , but I think the Council also needs to show this sense of responsibility by taking Parliament &apos;s proposals into consideration .
In the meantime , the environmental protection of the planet must be at the heart of any serious environmental policy .
Tehran must waste no time in bringing us proof and in backing up its words with action .
It is not the European Parliament ’ s job to try out forms of political pressure that may hasten the approval of an unsatisfactory agreement , nor to allow the expression of veiled threats about the emergence of a variable @-@ speed Europe , once again introducing unnecessary tensions into a process that requires maturity , responsibility and common sense in the difficult policies to be adopted .
I have to tell you that the discussions lawyers had in this area occasionally reminded me of disputations in ancient Byzantium on the sex of angels .
Second , the directive clarifies the entitlements of patients and related conditions to receive health care in another Member State .
In 1989 , the Transylvanian city of Temesvár ( Timişoara ) became Romania &apos;s first free city .
We think that all parties have a strong interest in reaching a swift agreement .
The Commission is the guardian of treaties that are already unacceptable .
I should therefore like to pay tribute to the rapporteur for his safety proposals , regarding both the aircraft themselves and the level of training of cabin and ground crew .
All that is hypocrisy on a massive scale , and our group will have no part of it .
It is vital that our continent should also be able to develop and produce new technology .
– Mr President , yesterday evening , we asked Parliament ’ s services to regard Amendment No 12 , which the Group of the Party of European Socialists tabled in an attempt to bring about equal treatment , as an addition .
However , we cannot but condemn certain &apos; lefties &apos; who have no hesitation in joining forces with the reactionaries , so that they do not appear to be lagging behind in supposedly defending human rights .
At this point , the only way to protect taxpayers &apos; money is to reduce the EU budget drastically .
I acknowledge that protecting the environment and taking it into consideration when evaluating policies is a necessity and even an obligation .
If we do not need to be concerned about China , Mr Titley , then I do not know what else we should be concerned about .
In my opinion , the main obstacle is finding the synergy &apos;s proper place in this increasingly complex picture of EU initiatives towards the east .
Indeed , we must ensure that our fellow citizens do not lose confidence , and can regain confidence , in the political institutions . Without such confidence , no structural reform or acceptance of the necessary austerity measures will be possible .
I should like to ask whether you believe cooperation with the current Belarussian authorities to be possible , even in the present circumstances ?
Ireland has been ruined by the single currency .
We analyse every @-@ day life , but we pay very little attention to what has happened to the developing countries as a result of the global economic crisis .
The debate on the Middle East here in Parliament and in the media has , more often than not , been focused on Iraq and the election in Palestine .
Ask those who are persecuted and incarcerated in China , North Korea and Uzbekistan , where there is already a supposedly enhanced human rights dialogue whether it has helped them .
European solidarity must be reflected in financial terms by the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund and by means of other European @-@ funded projects .
in writing . - Mr Özdemir &apos;s report on the EU &apos;s strategy for Central Asia deals with a key issue on the EU &apos;s foreign policy agenda .
Secondly , in terms of the enormous issue of nuclear safety , the debate centres on Chernobyl , since Ukraine has already taken a series of steps in relation to the military aspect of nuclear arms .
Every year , at the onset of summer , the Commission draws up , on the basis of the 1976 directive , the survey of bathing waters .
There is a net flow of skills away from Africa , where individuals make decisions to go where they can earn and where they can take their careers forward .
The debt is grossly unfair .
She was one of the very best .
The rule would also allow the parties to agree , if they so wish , on more precise arrangements for their cooperation , which opens the door to possibilities such as a joint working group .
I would like to thank my fellow Members , the Secretariat and the Commission for their cooperation .
Thank you for your comprehensive answer .
If only the system had been made more transparent , better technical solutions sought and the information systems spoken of in the proposal introduced , these measures would presumably have been enough to force prices down .
We have been waiting for a reply from you since September on ECHELON , the unspeakable EU / US secret service dossier .
This is part of a tradition that I am happy to uphold .
We must take care to ensure , I believe , that surplus embryos are not produced .
Madame President , vehicle exhaust emissions are currently the largest single source of atmospheric pollution .
This is only one example of the chronic foot @-@ dragging we see endlessly in the Council and by individual Member States .
Firstly , this means setting up clear , public objectives assigned to each dialogue so that a coherent , shared strategy , appropriated at the highest level , emerges .
In conclusion , I think that the work involving Parliament , the Council and the Commission has produced an outcome for the trans @-@ European transport network guidelines that is generally positive , economically realistic , socially responsive and helpful to the needs of the peripheral regions and to environmental protection .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , sometimes we must take very difficult decisions .
In this regard , it is also important that we should have sufficient funds available to be able to promptly and effectively integrate the new information and communications technologies into Europe ’ s education and training systems .
It is not because the population has shown no interest ; on the contrary , turnout was extremely high and it also took place very peacefully .
It is clear that this type of terrorism , which includes chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear terrorism , represents a threat to peace and international security .
That means that minors aged 14 and over can spend up to four years in what are called ‘ education camps ’ , waiting to be executed , instead of being able to have a proper education and a future to look forward to .
The Commission reserves its position on Amendments 54 , 56 , 58 , 61 , 62 , 63 , 66 and 75 .
With regard to classification , BSE status : I accept Amendments Nos 13 , 14 , 51 and 58 .
Reference was made to a summit and to other rumours .
Finally , in the face of threats that have become more real due to the liberalisation of the energy sector - set in motion by the directives on gas and electricity - , I believe it is very important that Member States are able to maintain their sovereign right to opt for the energy form of their choice .
In my own country , Ireland , it was shown recently that it is more likely for an elderly person to die from a road accident than it is for those who are under the age of 65 .
There are security issues , as we have heard today .
The work of the European Union is sometimes seen as rather technical : interesting to specialists , but not relevant to people &apos;s daily lives .
Each country must make up its own mind whether or not it wants nuclear power stations ; Austria ’ s position is quite clear on this – and I know that other countries take a different one – and that must be respected .
We discussed this at length , tabled many motions and have had some really good discussions with Mrs van Dijk .
At the summit , we will achieve a speedy conclusion to negotiations on the second stage of the Air Transport Agreement , which will give the transatlantic economy an additional boost .
For the sector , it will become much easier to trade across the border .
It would be contrary to our economic interests if we allowed the US and Japan to dominate markets as a result of their patent protection , while Europe &apos;s companies are squeezed out .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Thanks to Mr Ferber &apos;s hard work , we have what I think is a first class result with what appeared to be an exceptionally tricky issue .
An additional factor was that the payment forecasts submitted to the Commission by the Member States are often - if I may put it diplomatically - very optimistic .
And as long as we do , we will still be living in the age of Aristotle .
Let us start by regulating and legalizing all drugs , now .
All the members of the WTO considered this document to be a sound basis for moving forward .
We must therefore look towards the future .
A level playing field is also urgently required at institutional , political , assistance and economic level regarding our policy towards the South and the East .
Mr President , Commissioner , what we are dealing with here in these procurement directives is very definitely a multi @-@ faceted problem .
In June 2008 , the European Parliament managed to approve a resolution prohibiting this type of marketing after several attempts .
I am all the more pleased as we will soon be discussing the proposed Council regulation on North @-@ South cooperation in the fight against drugs and drug dependence , which therefore completes the prevention aspect of the subject .
EU history is littered with the corpses of all these whistleblowers .
The second philosophy , the so @-@ called philosophy of regulated markets , considered that consumer protection required competition on a single , transparent market between all bids and offers , so as to enable clients to know the price and to benefit from the best possible price .
The Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats will be voting in favour of this report .
However , we were then forced to acknowledge a number of incidents which we were and are unable to accept .
Why does no one ever say that we are going to clamp down on hashish coming from Morocco via Spain and France , heroine from Turkey via Germany , and cocaine from Surinam via the Netherlands ?
Real unemployment in Bulgaria and Romania is terrifyingly high .
We have to have a serious communication policy as a tool for democracy , a tool for citizens .
Federalist thought in terms of European external policy can be summed by a few simple phrases , repeated ad nauseam for years now , in every tone and every form : &apos; If Europe had not been powerless , Yugoslavia could have been avoided .
The issue now to be discussed shows the European Union &apos;s resolve to counter this negative development .
( Applause )
It is a method that falls directly within the scope of this approach of building cities and not fragmented towns , as set out in the Leipzig Charter and the Territorial Agenda .
Mr President , the shameful truth is that our prosperous and free Europe is tolerating a lucrative trade - the trafficking in women - which involves torture , inhumane treatment and flagrant violations of fundamental rights .
I admit that we are going to get an extra part @-@ session this particular month , but only to average out for the one in 12 sessions that we need to do .
I know that the Commission is also devoting considerable attention to these aspects , and am confident that Parliament , too , will support this process within the framework of its dialogue with the level 3 committees .
in writing . - The notion of there being any form of breach of the right to information in Italy is erroneous .
In other words , the following injustice is being promoted : small- and medium @-@ sized farms will sustain losses from natural disasters and commercial crises , in the best case scenario of at least 30 % , while insurance capital &apos;s profitability will be guaranteed .
Madam President , over the last nine years , nearly 80 airlines have gone bankrupt in the European Union .
We can already see a hardening of attitudes today within the institution ; we think that this is the wrong approach .
That is why we call on Parliament to support this compromise .
We must therefore supplement national labour law and the national systems , otherwise it will not function .
In fact , I cannot imagine anyone voting against it .
For these reasons , I voted against the motion for a resolution entitled &apos; Authorisation and refusal of authorisation of certain health claims made on foods and referring to children &apos;s development and health &apos; .
In this way , we hope to establish what is termed a ‘ building blocks ’ approach , an open discussion on content , just as , in fact , a start has already , in my view , been made with your Parliament today .
The ruling party apparently does not like the fact that Sam Rainsy denounces corruption and human rights abuses .
As chairman of the Committee on Budgets , I would dearly love to know the cost of that temporary committee for an outcome that had nothing at the end of it .
This tool enables the Commission , enriched with the experience it has acquired in this field , to exempt certain aid from the notification procedure .
Unfortunately the Lisbon Treaty encourages that , which is , as I say , one of the reasons why we so object to it .
In the end , when he was threatened with being brought before the courts , he had to leave by the back door .
I neither wish nor am able , therefore , to enter into a more detailed discussion of the individual requests in Parliament &apos;s decision from last year .
Farmers in the outermost regions have already enjoyed the full benefits of the common agricultural policy for many years , whereas the EU has graciously ‘ allowed ’ farmers in the new Member States to receive shockingly low direct payments , thus depriving them of the chance to achieve the levels of farmers in the old Member States .
For years , we have been talking about creating a single permit for third @-@ country nationals who wish to live and work in a Member State .
As you know , we have published a Green Paper , we have presented an action plan and the Council has endorsed this action plan .
The Commission has explained it to us : we need 50 million immigrants by 2060 , but we are doing nothing to encourage them to come , and instead we have made it a priority to harmonise the return policy .
Does the proposal include a total ban on these nets , with the exception of the Baltic Sea ?
If you do not reject this motion as inadmissible , I would nevertheless ask that it be thrown out altogether on the grounds of irrelevance .
The rapporteur and the committee endorse the Commission &apos;s proposal in that respect .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , the new provision for building parliamentary capacity in ACP countries is particularly welcome .
Let me also take the opportunity , as he is present in the Chamber - and please allow me this - to also congratulate the leader of the group , who is sitting in front of me .
We in the European Parliament , and it is to the big groups that I am addressing this remark , must ...
We have all been turned into prima facie suspects .
However , it is clear that , as with all significant amendments to the Treaty , a few preparatory acts are necessary for the Lisbon Treaty to enter into force .
If we have to follow the legal investigation to its ultimate conclusion , I want to see that happen - but I want to see my farmers protected , and I do not want to see them sold down the river .
In other words , if impact studies are carried out by big companies that specialise in market manipulation , then those companies &apos; recommendations are naturally going to move in the direction of greater market manipulation .
If you agree we can give the floor to Mr Méndez de Vigo , otherwise you may continue .
It has been included among the projects of common interest but not yet among the priority projects .
These pages are , for the Commission , a major expression of renewed trust in Europe and its institutions .
Ban Ki @-@ moon urged all international actors to focus on the efforts for such a settlement .
I hope that on 1 May we will enter into a brave new world of solidarity and cooperation , not of recriminations and national tensions .
This decision was not preceded by any public scrutiny , and there was no democratic control by Parliament .
This raises a question I would like to ask about the basic right of those eventual members of future generations - to be born .
This is the case in Catalonia , where it is traditionally the feast day of San Jordi , St George , a day for celebrating the Catalan language and culture .
This directive makes a strong suggestion to the institutions , but in my view it is directed above all at vehicle manufacturers .
Economic growth has been stimulated again .
The risk was that the original enlargement date might be put off until 2009 .
There would also be other serious consequences , however .
Let me say a few words on the next steps .
As long as GALILEO remains a peaceful process , we do not principally reject it .
We will talk about this on another day .

EU citizens must be informed about changes to be made , and their cooperation and support must be secured .

Most of all , camera phones and the location services can be a problem ; for instance in the UK 10 % of respondents say they had an unpleasant image taken of them , 17 % of the kids feared that the image was posted online and forwarded to others , and 14 % had experienced cyber @-@ bulling .
What is more , during this tragedy , a scandal erupted over the UN , paralysed by the United States , being unable to obtain an immediate ceasefire , because Israel needed to be given time to finish its work on the ground .

Thank you .
The fact is that researchers in Europe are still faced with serious obstacles and a lack of opportunities .

I am very glad we were able to hold a discussion in this Chamber on the serious public health problem of doping in sport .

A bomb of money which is not being spent .
The inclusion of the Cultural Month initiative in the project has the capacity to help people learn about other nations ’ cultural heritage and to extend the project to a wider international level .

Exerting pressure by petitioning the Criminal Court in The Hague ?
Nevertheless , I do not have to support the organisation to deplore the failure to implement the Court &apos;s view that the PMOI &apos;s action gives no reason to include , or continue to include , them on the terror list thus visiting on them all the repressive consequences that follow .
This should form the basis for the Union &apos;s work on the various instruments based on the EC Treaty .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , 2007 is going to be a very exciting financial year , for in it , that which the Heads of State or Government , in December last year , adopted as their political priority , and was agreed on by this House and the Council this May , is , for the first time , to become a living reality .

Different Member States are working hard to improve air quality .
Both of these islands are therefore under strong migratory pressure .
Yet we react critically to the Council &apos;s first proposal and assess it critically , and we are ready to discuss Kosovo and Palestine in the short term and also to discuss and take decisions on the proposals on the Galileo programme and the European Institute of Technology on around the 19th and will try to come to a mutual understanding on these important issues .
&apos;The Earth belongs to all human beings &apos; is an approach that has moved me .
Membership of the European Union cannot be the only option we give to our neighbours and friends .
They may want to work , or choose to , and even if they do not , they may need to earn because mortgages must be paid and food must be put on the table .
We entirely agree with the rest of the measures in Mr Kuckelkorn ’ s report and we are finally left with the issue of the funding of the political parties .
So the first priority is genuine institutional reform right now , driven forward by the Portuguese Presidency .
Cooperation is continuing to take place between the British Government and the relevant authorities in the Commission and throughout the Union , to ensure that the outbreak is controlled , contained and eradicated as soon as possible .
The common agricultural policy should instead be rapidly reformed with fewer rules and fewer subsidies .
That is also what I am trying to achieve here .
I have also been a member of the Convention , and for ten years in a row I have represented my country in different formations of the Council .
A united Europe presupposes a single state , hence a parliament with legislative power and a government with executive power .
This is not , however , something that we Social Democrats take any pleasure in , because we neither want nor are able to replace Italy &apos;s internal opposition .
It is quite appalling that we should be creating economic advantages for businesses that treat animals inhumanely and cruelly in the name of the free market .
However , the Commission must act responsibly and accept the fact that some Member States would like to continue developing nuclear energy in the future , for two reasons in particular .

Apartment blocks must not be built ; there is not a strip of green in the whole of Athens .
For this reason , I welcome the Commission &apos;s intention to publish a communication in 2010 on respect for privacy and trust in the information society , since in my view , it is crucial to permanently monitor aspects relating to personal data protection .
Although this has drawbacks , it does offer more scope for tolerance and recognition of diversity than was the case for a long time .
It is more important to stick to the holy cow of monetary policy than to find jobs for the unemployed .

The people of that country are facing an extremely difficult , precarious and cold situation .
However , we should not overlook the instruments we have available to make our voice heard .
The practice of preparing lists of writers which should not be published reminds one of times we all believed were over .

I am pleased to admit that , mainly thanks to the force of her personality , Mrs Bonino has improved the situation in the past , especially with regard to information which now reaches us much more quickly .
Is the message not clear enough ?
I believe renewable energy can contribute to achieving all these goals , which are integral to the sustainable , environmentally sound development of the Union .

We are in Sweden , on the beautiful island of Gotland .
While number plates now bear the European emblem , indicating the Member State inside the circle of stars , in many cases the number plate provides no information .
As regards solidarity between the Member States , Parliament wanted binding mechanisms , Council wanted to entrench the voluntary nature of cooperation , and the final language is more neutral , but we do have an external evaluation of the Asylum Support Office to look forward to , which will cover the Support Office &apos;s impact on practical cooperation on asylum .
Next week , we must approve all the reports on the progress of relations with the applicant countries .
In order to ensure this , the Commission is clarifying its present substantive rules .

Today &apos;s report concerns one of the European Union &apos;s most important policies .
In this context , the EU has played a leading role in combating this type of fishing , specifically by fighting against flags of convenience .
Mr President , I think those were the most important questions to deal with in this short space of time .
It is simply unfortunate that the situation is now deadlocked for a number of reasons which I described in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy yesterday evening , though these must not be seen as an excuse , and must certainly not discourage us from continuing to try to improve the situation in our relations with Turkey .
Young people with just a little work experience are in a worse off position in the labour market , especially when it comes to staff cuts .
So there is no real justification for compensation .
Such action has clear public support , as shown by opinion polls carried out thus far .
Have we considered the fact that the candidate countries , which by then will be members , will need to learn to work within the European Parliament and , as in the past , their parliaments will need to send representatives to Parliament in Strasbourg and Brussels until such time as European elections are held ?
We are working on a new methodology for the DAS and we hope that with that new methodology we will be able to reach a point where we can provide the information required by Parliament and that that will be sufficient for the needs of our budgetary authority , both the Council and Parliament .
For the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , it is vital that there be no renationalisation of the EU &apos; s competition policy .
If this directive is adopted , the European Union will be giving a clear signal that the free market economy is important but that it is subject to limiting conditions .
In particular , the Union stressed its concern at the route of the so @-@ called security fence and the continued expansion of settlements , and reiterated the need for Israel , in the fight against terrorism , to avoid civilian casualties and destruction so as not to exacerbate the plight of the Palestinian people .
So I would say to you : there is a good area for you to work on - go on , I dare you !
If no promises are made or promises remain unfulfilled , this critical attitude will naturally increase .
Despite the complexity of this dossier , he has succeeded in amending the proposal of the European Commission in terms which satisfy me completely .
By asking these countries to stem the flow of sub @-@ Saharan refugees , we are encouraging and urging them to commit human rights violations .
The item is closed .
. ( FR ) I refused to vote for the joint resolution , which is the product of non @-@ transparent bartering between groups .
A plastic mat was lying in the field - which should not happen either - and the grass had grown through it .
It falls to us to ensure that preparations are made in the best possible circumstances , and this summit should provide an opportunity for the partnership between China and the European Union to address new issues , in particular those relating to action against climate change and to environmental and social standards - as many of you have said .
- insists on the need to apply the EU Solidarity Fund immediately to areas and countries affected ;

in writing . - I want to salute and congratulate my colleague in the Greek Greens , Michail Tremopoulos , for the adoption today of his report on transparency and regional policy and its funding .
It is like being in a dream !
After thirty years , these men and women survive in an entirely inhumane situation , deprived of the most basic needs and living in extremely difficult conditions .
&lt; empty &gt;
Mr President , you have described the new Treaty as retaining the substance of the Constitution .
That fund will act as a shock absorber to the powerful engine of globalisation .
The process of enlargement , about which everybody has fantasised in the past , is now being given flesh and bones .
Here in this Parliament we cannot so obviously turn our backs on this reality .
The accusation that the delegation &apos;s members , including Yolanda Pulecio de Betancourt , mother of the French former Colombian presidential candidate , Monsignor Luis Augusto Castro , the head of the Catholic Church in Colombia , and Dr Jose Noe Rios , the general secretary of the Colombian Liberal Party , are all supporters of the country &apos;s guerrilla movement , is both preposterous and puts the group in grave danger .
I do not think the idea can be presented in this manner , and the substance of this amendment surely requires further intensive discussion .
It is a delusion if anybody in this place thinks you were .
Mr President , I want to endorse the conclusions this report comes to .
One further point : I am dissatisfied by the reduction of eastern policy to the northern and Russian dimension , to the exclusion of the issues of Ukraine and Belarus .
We will then find ourselves in a situation in which a very far @-@ reaching , very complicated and very fundamental treaty will have to be ratified in 25 Member States , and will have to overcome the hurdle of a referendum in a good many Member States .
Rather than throwing President Prodi &apos; s plans for a food safety agency into chaos , it highlights the very need for such an agency at Community level .
This is equally important both for its basic principles and for the future budget .
The Commission will continue its efforts with a view to finding together with the European Parliament and the Council an appropriate solution to this horizontal institutional issue.&apos;
We must bring them closer to Europe and get them to spread the European message .

As head of the European Union monitoring mission during the last elections two years ago , I made several recommendations and I am pleased to see that the country has begun implementing some of them .
The Internet is a powerful tool but it must not be an unregulated area .
In anticipation of what I have heard about the content of some of tomorrow &apos;s proposed amendments - which had not been submitted in writing by the start of this afternoon &apos;s sitting - I say this : we will not support any attempt to introduce an automatic process which effectively requires us , as Parliament , to cede our own right as the decision @-@ making body on the issue of discharge and makes us a kind of secretariat for the Court of Auditors .
( RO ) Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Győri on the mandate she currently has , and I wish her and the Hungarian Presidency every success .
As the European Commission has acknowledged , certain Member States will have more difficulty complying with the Directive for historical reasons relating to lack of infrastructures , low population density or , simply , consumer habits .
We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left voted against this report , because the proposals it contains are somewhat surreal and totally ignore the social rallies that have been taking place for several months in EU Member States against austerity plans , anti @-@ social measures and the dismantling of social security systems and public services : these are the only measures envisaged to limit the Member States &apos; budget deficits .
The number of night flights should therefore be significantly reduced .
As a practising pharmacist , I feel it is important that the report gives valuable impetus to the debate on the question of self @-@ medication .
This is an extremely sensitive issue which is closely related to other matters which are regularly referred to such as the ageing population , the demographic trend , the low birth rate , the right to health , the right to work , the right to motherhood and the social value of motherhood . This matter cannot be viewed as affecting women alone : they must be protected and supported by society .

In addition , under the 2008 pilot programme for forest fires , we are cooperating with Member States to create tactical reserves that will be on standby for emergencies in Europe .
We need to demonstrate a more responsible and less demanding attitude , since equal gender representation is now the accepted approach .
Obviously , those more concerned with the outcome of the cooperation policies and the institutional and managerial correctness of the measures taken by the Community institutions .
We encourage the Commission and the Council to get the remaining bits of that legislation to us as quickly as possible because that is what Europe needs .
Oral explanations of vote
It has no clear idea of how complex this whole matter is .

This proposal is about giving greater responsibility to shipowners by strengthening the liability scheme .
Our yearly progress reports are contained in the summary reports . It also true that it falls to Member States to implement them .
It is a very good thing that the reports states that &apos; the use of civil protection resources , where deployed in any humanitarian crisis , should be needs driven and complementary to , and coherent with , humanitarian aid ... , with a view to ensuring compliance with the humanitarian principles of neutrality , humanity , impartiality and dependence &apos; .
It can be a good thing when there is a level playing field .
But TACIS in Ukraine is not the only problem .
I hope that these encouraging data will not be an excuse for making less effort , but a clear signal that we have identified the key , strategic points and that we must continue to concentrate on these .
The Council is currently discussing the package of measures put forward by the Commission in February , the aim of which is to deal with the disequilibrium in the market for beef within the Union in both the short term and the long term and to raise the quality .
We must also be concerned , however , with the health of farmers and their families , who need better protection as it is they who come into direct contact with these products and the advice they receive is often the advice of the companies marketing the pesticides . The companies are hardly likely to tell them that researchers have started asking questions about the link between exposure to pesticides and the steadily increasing incidence of certain conditions such as Parkinson &apos;s disease , Alzheimer &apos;s , prostate cancer , brain tumours and congenital deformities .
I am , however , filled with pride when I see women taking on important responsibilities with respect to inter @-@ generational solidarity within the framework of the family .

There is also the ethical question : How are we to use what computers make available to us ?
The debate is closed .
If three quarters of the Members of Parliament were prepared to take up such a clear and , in certain cases , courageous stance on this issue in a roll @-@ call vote last month , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , it is because , thanks to the Iraqi crisis , they understood that it was essential to give their unreserved support to our colleagues currently working in the working groups on defence , chaired by Commissioner Barnier , and on foreign policy , chaired by Mr Dehaene .
Generally speaking , good news regarding employment makes the stock exchange nervous , as it makes them afraid of a rise in inflation .

This reached us conference participants not by chance but by design .
But we as Europeans also need a balance between continents , because we are not just a fortunate island ; we also have to think about relations between the continents .
Let those countries remember that El Niño will have grown up before too long , and that the situation will only get worse .

The Eastern Partnership has brought additional tools .
Better training of railway personnel must therefore be high on the agenda , and this must have a trans @-@ border dimension .
Many of them , men , women and children , die during the journey or are thrown into the sea by their captains , as happened along the coasts of Sicily and Puglia .

According to the Court of Auditors , the gap between actual receipts and their theoretical amount is EUR 70 thousand million .
If the present proposals go through , this may well lead to considerable distortions of the market , especially for small and medium @-@ sized businesses , so I very much hope that Commissioner van Miert is aware of this problem .
Mr President , I am referring to the proposals as being &quot; long @-@ awaited &quot; .
This situation should alert us to the need to change the Community &apos;s monetarist policies , and in particular to review the Stability Pact , in order to give the highest priority to public investment and other means of promoting employment and social inclusion .

Lastly , in direct response to a question raised by Mrs Lucas on the issue of ship greenhouse gas emissions , I am pleased to inform her that the International Maritime Organisation is due to adopt a strategy on this issue later this week .
All these discussions result from the fact that we are able to take a higher degree of responsibility than ever before .
Each Member State demanding its initial bet would thus be free to dip into the Lisbon Strategy , and thus to become an unrivalled competitor - and we know full well that competition generally goes hand in hand with environmental damage - or to claim that sustainable development , which requires a global approach , is the opposite of such competition .
It is also true that Europe , and I mean society , is changing quickly , as are information and communication technologies .
What is going on here is agitation and an attempt at undermining the law of a Member State and an important principle of the European Union , that being the subsidiarity principle , and the most important principle in our Charter of Fundamental Rights , the right to life .
These represent quite a significant number .
In my view this is too low a figure .
This explains how members of the parliamentary opposition can be treated as public enemies and locked up .
With the enlargement of the Union on 1 May , the Union and Ukraine will become neighbouring areas and therefore over the coming years we will have an even greater opportunity to enhance our relations .
The Council has quoted examples of inconsistency time after time : in agriculture , commerce , in conflict prevention , in the peace operations , in the fisheries sector , migration and environment .
The other thing which is important under the ‘ Finance ’ heading is the question of fees and the way that the structure of payments works .
If we consider that 30 years are spent studying and 30 years are spent at work , then they will be on a pension for 40 years .
Finally , in the present programming period , under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance , Member States can co @-@ finance studies and innovative projects covering the specific situation of women shellfish gatherers .
The Commission willingly subscribes to the report &apos;s conclusions , therefore , but with some reservations .
It is for all these reasons that I voted against this report .
The rules relating to variations will be the same everywhere , whatever the type of authorisation , whether it is a national authorisation , mutual recognition procedure or centralised procedure for a medicinal product .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the start of the first financial year of the Financial Perspective that we negotiated in April and adopted in May is almost upon us ; the financial framework is a tight one , and presents us with a number of problems as regards the achievement of our policy objectives .
In fact , they are almost - I would respectfully suggest - weak .

This network operates via national contact points which advise and support local authorities .
And here we really do need the cooperation of everybody .
Like Mr Cot , I beg the Commissioner to make sure that this is done .

And not just those of Soviet design .

When they landed in Somalia , before having to withdraw in disarray , it was not to guarantee their takeover of the oil route , it was to restore hope .
All the descriptions have been through an Orwellian office for newspeak , so all future initiatives benefit everyone and inconvenience no one .
Clearly there is a vital need for transatlantic cooperation to combat terrorism and major crime , but it must be done in full respect of the rule of law - domestic and international - and of fundamental rights .
That is why Europe ’ s choice must be clear .
I am actually very proud of the fact that it was the Commission , together with the High Representative , that presented the blueprint for our response immediately : a partnership for democracy in North Africa and the Southern Mediterranean and also a partnership for shared prosperity .
In this respect , the directive adopted on renewable energy sources and the proposal on the promotion of biofuels are going to lead to great progress in terms of the diversification of the supply of clean energy , but they are not the solution in either the short or medium terms .
Are you moving this on behalf of your Group ?
The Union is in full evolution and is preparing for its future , including that of the CFSP .
Mrs McKenna , the Council has not been informed of the US Government plans referred to in your question .
It can support them , but I think that this is something that also relates to the social dimension , which has already been mentioned .
I would like to thank my colleagues and the other political groups for the intensive , fruitful co @-@ operation we have had prior to this second reading also .
By the time the Prime Minister &apos;s country takes over the reins in 2009 , the EU will have undergone a democratic revolution : it will be more open , more accountable , more responsive to its citizens .
Later , in another paragraph , we say that we want to control ozone @-@ depleting substances , and I am all in favour of this objective .
I think that we have achieved a balance between making our approach as European as possible with supervisors who are as independent as possible , and achieving a theoretical model that is also workable in practice .
I should also like to add that statements that have unfortunately been repeated in this House , to the effect that President Yushchenko ’ s supporters included chauvinists or nationalists , are lies and loathsome provocation , and it is a shame that Members of this House are prepared to be party to such provocation .
A food agency , which some have doubts about , is to me as credible and as necessary as an environment agency , about which there were also doubts at its inception .
My question relates to this issue .
Nor can we deny that international adoption constitutes an important form of international cooperation .
Otherwise , encouraging progress has also been noted in three areas .
I voted in favour of this resolution because it is commensurate with the Union &apos;s new ambitions at international level .
Other cohesion mechanisms - perhaps loss of the right to vote on questions of monetary policy - would be enough .
Opinions are also divided on the European balancing out proposed by the Committee on Agriculture .
We have free trade agreements where Article 2 , the human rights clause , has never actually been enforced .
rapporteur . - Madam President , let me say something which , in my view , has not been properly outlined .
( The sitting was suspended at 19.30 and resumed at 21.00 )
While that is a very desirable aim , we should not allow the best to become the enemy of the good .
Additionally , it sets the desired level of harmonisation in distance and off @-@ premises contracts as well as the right of withdrawal at Community level .
I also represent my country with the utmost humility , because we are here to share , and I think that the best way of sharing is to come with humility , to come prepared to unite , to join together and to defend the great ideal of the European Union together .
We are on the eve of the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Kyoto .
However , I do think it is essential also to appeal to the Commission and the Council .
That being the case , if products are not available in the EU from a voluntary and non @-@ remunerated supply , we should not prevent products being imported from outside the EU for the protection of human health and the delivery of services to people in need .
Since its resignation the Commission has continued to be fully active in all its rights and duties , and that applies to me also .
In some cases , they tag the fish first , contributing to conservation programmes .
We support maintaining critical dialogue , but flexibility must not become the norm for our policy .
Mario Mauro 262 votes
In voting &apos; no &apos; , voters voted to protect their jobs , their farms , their families and their constitution .
However , it is also extremely important to increase the trust of society in this branch of medicine , especially because every so often , news comes to the attention of public opinion in Europe about a variety of irregularities , including the illegal trafficking of organs from unknown sources .
For example , it has tabled proposals for recovery rooms , rooms for injecting heroin under supervision and needle exchange programmes .
The PvdA delegation does not consider this vote to be a reflection of how it views the content of the resolutions of 3 December 1998 and 5 May 1999 .
The company was thus obliged to make do with documentation in French only .
Aid is now subject to a customs levy of some 30 % which has to be paid by the recipient of the aid .
I must point out that in the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities , certain amendments have been introduced into the report which neither I , as rapporteur , nor my group , agree with .
Inspire also seeks to promote the reuse , but above all the exchange and sharing , of data between governments , and , without doubt , to be a driving force behind the pooling of new relevant environmental information .
Here we look to Greece and Turkey to help broker an agreement before the Copenhagen Summit .
I would support a 1 % increase because , although a lot has been said about soft landings , I do not believe it .
Farmers should not therefore fear this limit , because it will oblige the processing industry to locate itself nearer the places where the animals have been reared .
The Commission seems to view security as a means to ensure that the , &apos; stability of the Internal Market is maintained &apos; , which misses the point .
These projects make it possible , within a town , country or region , to involve a broad range of social groups , to generate new solidarity and develop social interaction .
I believe they are worthy .
We must not accept this amendment ; the laboriously @-@ achieved compromise in the Water Framework Directive must not be altered by a daughter directive on groundwater .
Mr President , I can immediately follow on from what the previous speaker has said and I also share his estimate relating to the choice of time and agree with him that it is not necessarily a matter which requires great urgency .
The solution is a political one : stop the military occupation and the expansion of settlements , recognise the Palestinian Government of national unity , and work to achieve Palestinian unity and not division .
This is the result of a collective effort .
( HU ) Thank you , Mr President .
Secondly , if anybody has declared war , it is certain sectors .
Instead of providing full @-@ time , stable employment , it proposes to extend part @-@ time employment and anti @-@ educational , quick @-@ fix specialisation programmes , turning women into cheap , flexible labour .
Investment in health is the most effective and efficient investment there can be for a society tailored to people &apos;s needs .
The order of the vote has been fixed for some time , but we shall take your point when we get to the relevant part of the vote .
And this is true , especially when it comes to reviewing the CAP , the Structural Funds , the consolidation of the situation of the outermost regions and creating a genuine European immigration strategy .
I am pleased that much of what we called for in this report was reflected in the Commission &apos;s communication published in April , and , perhaps naively , I like to believe that was part of the intense interaction between the Commission &apos;s DGs and the European Parliament .
Women should not only bear up half of heaven , they should also accept responsibility for decisions concerning our whole world .
The Commission must be aware that it should have made balanced proposals , that the fisheries policy is unlikely to progress under this measure , as it is unlikely to enter into force and meanwhile , Commissioner , we shall continue to waste valuable time that could be used to solve the problems of the fishing sector .
It is vital that everything possible is done in order to limit the consequences resulting from such a state of affairs in these regions .
First is the element of continuity : past presidents changed every six months ; that is , after every second or third meeting .
It is right and proper that we should be discussing the situation facing the Gypsies in Kosovo today .
Israel , undeterred , builds a wall around East Jerusalem in violation of its roadmap obligations and international law .
It certainly represents a compelling deadline .
( DE ) Mr President , the first three years of a child &apos;s life are crucial for the development of the brain and for language learning .
It is a realistic ambition for as many European countries as possible to adopt the principles of the European Union .
Kyoto provided the platform .
in writing . - ( SV ) I am voting against this report because it contains proposals for the detailed regulation at EU level of such matters as the payment of Swedish parental allowances , which will create difficulties in individual assessments , and it gives the EU too much power .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.25 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
Among these compromise proposals I would like to highlight in particular the significant contribution of the proposal to include in the statistics data concerning units with fewer than 10 employees , the proposal to distinguish between vacancies for fixed @-@ term and permanent posts , and the proposal to ensure that as many European citizens as possible have access to the data .
Concerning the amendments to the mechanism for exempting contracting entities from the directive - Article 30 of the common position - let me stress that the common position is based on two principles , legal certainty and real , effective liberalisation .
These principles follow on logically from the work that was started when the REACH Regulation on chemicals was being discussed .
I would like to stress how inconsistent the Commission ’ s management of this issue of humane trapping has been .
We have undertaken to achieve two things : to associate the candidate countries - although even the meaning of the word &apos; associate &apos; has not been defined , but it will probably not include voting rights ; we do not yet know .
I wish to conclude this overview of the various categories of expenditure with the expenditure on pre @-@ accession aid .
We in the Commission do not intend to intervene with the industry on this issue , but we are encouraging equipment manufacturers to work with telecommunication equipment suppliers and mobile network operators in the design of the in @-@ vehicle systems , which require reliability , robustness and functionality .
At present , there are only two areas on which the rapporteur and my group disagree .
( The President cut off the speaker )
It would , therefore , be a serious mistake if we were to reverse this decision of 1995 , in the present time .
However , we must also have food production and a production system which means that we do not handle foods in the wrong way during production .
Can you put pressure on those countries that have not ratified that Convention to do just that ?
The application of Community competition law by administrative and judicial authorities must not lead to any lack of uniformity in its application .
The chocolate war has been raging within the EU for 25 years .
That said , despite good progress , much remains to be done .
We have the affluence , we have good sanitation , the wherewithal for proper – even superior – nutrition .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
While this development encourages the economic development of nations , it has a significant impact on climate change .
Eliminating energy islands and creating links between states and regions should be the main priority of EU energy policy , supported by the finances and political will of the Union .
Today , the European Union is in no condition to say &apos; yes &apos; to the candidate countries , and , unfortunately , the reasons for that are not entirely budgetary .
It is estimated that a group of between 350 000 and 900 000 people are affected .
Mr Brok &apos;s report also mentions training .
Not to do so would be a mistake .
On the other hand , small distillers producing not only alcohol but also spirits could benefit from the de minimis rule on state aid for non @-@ agricultural products .
The fact that the working hours directive has been included in the scope of controls is another example of the report overshooting the mark .
In our debate , we in the Committee on International Trade saw it as particularly important to discuss matters that affect our area .
Finally , with regard to the transatlantic Summit at the end of this month , it is very important to demonstrate the will of both sides to once again take up our responsibilities within a multilateral context , particularly at a time when there are signs of hope in the Middle East peace process and an opportunity to work for the future of the United Nations .
The Commission cannot endorse the request in paragraph 8 that &apos; phasing out &apos; also be introduced in the Cohesion Fund .
In legal terms , I think the issue is clear .
We have nervous consumers who are often nervous for no reason .
Some Member States were already a long way ahead when compared with the reference year .
There are serious shortcomings in the Member States &apos; management and control systems here .
Obviously , the Czech Republic still has more time to implement the acquis communautaire in full , but people might well have doubts about whether the Czech Republic is willing even now to start taking on board these aspects of European policy which are of fundamental importance for its citizens and for environment policy .
Mr President , the result of the conciliation that we have before us is a substantial improvement upon the rules for the release of GMOs into the environment .
To that end , my Group welcomes Prime Minister Salam Fayyad &apos;s determination to restore security and President Abbas &apos;s commitment to dialogue .
The European Union is capable of doing this .
I watched these events , which were also the order of the day in Austria two or three years ago , with horror , in other words , with heartfelt sympathy and understanding .
This latest decision alters the obligations of the Commission arising from the previous regime , that is of having to grant annual aid , and Members States no longer need to grant aid for setting up production teams .
However , no sooner have the first difficulties appeared than people have started talking about how the criteria are interpreted .
A transparent and effective mechanism monitoring the adoption of children both pre- and post @-@ adoption and the involvement of international organisations does not only promote the rights of children but also allows their harmonious upbringing .
Today &apos;s resolution did not need to express indignation , simply to call for the aid to be stopped .
Whenever I discuss the budget , I cannot help but mention agricultural spending .
This affects &apos; business tourism &apos; - in other words , conferences and congresses - as well as private business travel .
We want to see facts because time is at a premium , Mr Prodi .
Madam President , the Commission proposal reviewing the rules for public broadcasting is unacceptable as it currently stands .
There is absolutely no argument here .
You have shown that if we look to the future and believe and trust in a vision we can get there .
Since then a lot has happened , most importantly the review of the Code of Conduct .
As has already been mentioned , negotiations with the Russian Federation are taking place to secure helicopters .
Mr Juncker , in your coming document you must remove the precedent of marginalising three million citizens .
Member States are currently taking fiscal consolidation measures to ensure the long @-@ term sustainability of public finances .
In 1992 this is more or less what we were told : we shall stick to this situation for the next six years .
Mr President , Europe may remain split if its peoples are played off against one another .
Mr President , I wish to offer Mrs Kratsa my warmest congratulations , both on her initiative in drafting this report and on the report itself and the clear policy proposals contained in it .
I think Mr Verheugen is mistaken if he thinks that the Greek Cypriots are adherents of this plan .
I would like to point out very clearly that all activities planned under our country strategy papers are development activities and fall within the priority sectors identified in the DCI .
This tendency has already had very adverse effects at United Nations level , which must give cause for concern .
I am sure we will debate this in the future .
We in the EU have on many occasions discussed the subject of Guantánamo with the US administration .
It will become totally invisible !
However , the desire of the Hungarian people for freedom was manifested just as powerfully against communism , the twentieth century &apos;s oppressive regime , as the events of 1956 amply demonstrated .
If we demonstrate wisdom , if we understand what we can and must do , I can see an opportunity for developing our idea of a Europe at the service of our citizens .
Unless we recognise the economic and political importance of restoring the real economy , rather than the virtual economy , the report runs the risk of making a fatal mistake : suggesting ways out of the crisis which would ultimately not be a real solution .
The Commission is making good progress with &apos; acquis screening &apos; and we hope that by the end of the year about half of the chapters will have been checked , so that we can really get started with substantial negotiations at a meeting of ministers in November .
Most of this resolution is irrelevant to the Mochovce circumstances .
There are already plenty of rules , but enforcement and controls are lacking .
Some are inevitable , as the ruling of the Court prevents the Commission from pretending that nothing has happened .
I briefly want to say that the problem of duplication is often advanced to highlight the weaknesses of the European Union and to limit the European Union &apos;s aspiration to be ambitious .
We are also seeing what can only be described as an ideological clash between humanism and liberalism , and on top of that we have some interesting cross @-@ currents muddying the more usual political divisions which have been revealed for example by the speech of our colleague Mr Casini , or the thoughtful speech of Mr FabreAubrespy .
We propose defining the fishing effort so that the reduction in fishing opportunities since 1995 and the actual fishing effort deployed between 1998 and 2002 are taken into account .
Furthermore , a data policy must also be put into place swiftly .
The second point I want to pick up is the same as that addressed by Mrs Berès .
The Minutes of yesterday &apos; s sitting have been distributed .
If small and medium @-@ sized enterprises ( SMEs ) are , for the first time , to be put at the heart of European legislation , it is no cause for celebration .
I can only regret the fact that in this case the possibility of ascertaining the burden on business and the alleviation of this burden was not considered .
Thirdly , there is information policy .
( FI ) Mr President , the rapporteur , the Committee on Transport and Tourism , and , obviously , Parliament as a whole , have to be congratulated on this excellent piece of legislation .
I particularly endorse the conclusion which states that Parliament considers that the European Union should play a role in reducing the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation , increasing nuclear safety and encouraging the development of better relations between the DPRK and its neighbours and that membership of KEDO will enable it the better to play that role .
Grazing should also be allowed on set @-@ aside land , and regulated organic farms should be allowed to use legumes grown there as forage .
- ( EL ) Mr President and Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , thank you for the replies which you have given us .
The talk now is simply of companies and of competition between companies , and the social dimension is forgotten .
‘ And God said , &quot; Let there be light , &quot; and there was light . ’
With regard to the investigations into legal deposit procedures and registration schemes , groups of film industry experts will be convened this autumn and we shall commence the debate on the results of these investigations .
Furthermore , Parliament is aiming at the wrong main target .
Supposing there were to be an accident at a nuclear power station , such as that at Temelin in the Czech Republic ?
The problem is that the new Member States do not have functioning producer organisations , and it will take several years for them to become fully operational .
The curriculum vitae submitted by H.G. Wessberg for his nomination as a member of the Court of Auditors shows skills and experience that are certainly in line with the technical and scientific standards required by the position .
I want to highlight just three issues within Parliament budget .
I agree with Mr Occhetto that there is a third force in play .
At second reading we adopted a number of amendments with which the Council did not immediately agree , but in the end conciliation has produced a good result .
The most shocking aspect of this report , therefore , which closely follows the Commission &apos;s recommendations for this year &apos;s economic guidelines , is the argument it makes for its increasingly neoliberal measures despite the serious consequences they are having .
Since the breakup of the Soviet Union , these two regions have not in practice been part of Georgia .
I simply believe that after I have been pleading for years for prevention in Kosovo and that has not been achieved , one cannot say after ten years : we must take preventive measures .
They therefore require an appropriate legal basis , as called for by the rapporteur , and they should be highly predictable .
This is true at any age , but particularly in the case of young people .
Such power must at all times be rigorously justified and clearly explained .
With the transfer of new directives and two decisions into two regulations , the text has been simplified and updated in accordance with new technological and scientific developments .
It is not just a matter of pushing a cart ; it is a quite exceptional field , because information is at present the most important tool of production .
But our objectives can be achieved using methods such as social dialogue , the Structural Funds , especially the European Social Fund , which has a large budget , mainstreaming , political analysis , research and , finally , legislation .
Societies must learn .
Let us proceed to the vote .
That is a very important point that we should include here .
Paragraph 33 therefore needs to be updated to say that 28 negotiating chapters have so far been provisionally closed rather than 27 .
Its history is intertwined inseparably with European history .
in order to remind the Commission that the European Parliament &apos;s monitoring powers must be respected because they are the only real means of protecting the citizens , the European taxpayers .
The Commission &apos;s response to us is that this whole business is complex , many parties come into play , nothing can be done by working alone , it is expensive , one cannot ask some Member States to comply with a number of rules and not ask the others to do the same , and so on . The pretexts and excuses for the lacklustre results are legion and , sadly , there have not been enough initiatives to fight effectively against this activity of illegal fishing which , once again , has developed at an extremely serious rate over the last few years .
This is not to mention the supply chain , where large numbers of jobs will also be lost .
That is like a Scot saying we want England to win at football .
This control must , above all , come from the EU delegations in developing countries .
Europe needs solidarity .
That is why I am delighted today with your ambitious vote on the Lucas report , which anticipates a whole battery of measures to combat the environmental impact of aviation including , in particular , the end of the exemption of aviation fuel from VAT .
The EGF was set up in 2006 to provide practical support to workers made redundant either for reasons associated with the relocation of their companies or , following the 2009 amendment , on account of the economic crisis , in order to assist their reintegration into the labour market .
Parliament earlier rejected ratification of the financial protocol between the EU and Morocco precisely because of the Moroccan government &apos;s infringements of international law .
There is absolutely no leeway on this .
It might be argued that , given the situation in South Africa , it would be good to have those authorisations by the beginning of the year .
As the current scheme expires on 31 December of this year , the Commission already presented a new proposal back in May 2010 .
I would just like to ask the Commission to use its imagination again and find a solution , or legal basis , within the framework of the new Amsterdam Treaty , so that in future useful programmes or projects such as these , which are not concerned with employment , may be supported .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , plenary will vote tomorrow on the Marco Polo II programme to improve the environmental performance of freight transport .
On the basis of this analysis , the Commission , in response to the invitation made by the General Affairs Council in June 2009 , has therefore proposed the abolition of the visa for the citizens of Macedonia , Montenegro and Serbia .
I should like to know what the Council Presidency ’ s specific goals in this field are , both working alone and in cooperation with other international partners , as on the basis of your comments my impression is that the driving force on this issue will be the Council , not the Commission .
The railways are bad , too slow , too expensive , unreliable . ’
The Lisbon Strategy cannot be implemented in a manner which would eat away at the financial basis of the welfare society and which would be grossly unfair .
However , these requirements must be binding for both sides , they must be met and , if they are not met , it must have consequences for both sides on account of social dumping .
It has given Europe free trade , competitiveness and welfare .
I also feel that the Council is acting in a schizophrenic manner when it requests more assistance for Frontex and cuts back the budget by 2.5 % at the same time , against a backdrop of credits already exhausted for the year 2007 .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in both his explanatory statement and in the speech he made to this plenary , the rapporteur informed us that it was not his intention to draw up a report presenting an exhaustive framework of breaches of fundamental rights in all countries of the European Union .
However , the question remains as to when and if at all .
In this respect , I encourage you , Commissioner , to continue in this direction and to develop cooperation with the other committees , with the European Commission &apos;s other services , as well as with Baroness Ashton &apos;s European External Action Service .
The problem to date has been , in my experience in Northern Ireland , that the consumer has borne the brunt of the cost of the extra traceability , and this has been substantial .
China is a vast country with a trained and productive workforce , but it is not a democracy and remains essentially an authoritarian , one @-@ party , Communist State – although Marxism plays little part in its political or economic thinking at present .
Going back to the speech made by my fellow Member , Mrs Sartori , safety and health care efficiency can be improved by setting out a programme that , above all , takes account of these fundamental points : 1 ) increasing the number of nurses specialising in infection control ; 2 ) implementing training for healthcare and paramedical workers , focusing especially on nosocomial infections and the antibiotic resistance of the viruses which cause them ; 3 ) enabling new discoveries coming from research on these diseases .
To get to the point , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market proposes not to waive the parliamentary immunity of Mr Ribeiro e Castro .
In the political field we have seen cooperation on issues dealing with Iraq , Iran , Sudan , the southern Caucasus , Central Asia and Belarus , not to mention the broader Middle East and the Mediterranean .
Three thousand jobs are given priority in one Member State but not in others .
These matters lie within the competence of the Member States and we are confident that the Member States will take these important questions into consideration.&apos;
Let us therefore work together , in the framework of the ‘ Citizens for Europe ’ programme , to jointly remember the victims of Stalinism and Nazism .
It will be hard to explain to the citizens of Europe why EUR 14 million of taxes were squandered on the Fléchard case and why Parliament is letting itself be fobbed off with empty promises .
Evidence that came to light 33 years later - including eye @-@ witness accounts by Turkish soldiers - strongly indicates that he was transported to Turkey , where he was adopted by a Turkish army officer who had no children of his own .
I welcome this report as it will save those hundreds of car crash victims who find themselves trapped in their cars and unable to reach their mobile phones because of their injuries .
I refer to cooperation and coordination on the conditions of entry of third @-@ country nationals , cooperation on the flow of tourists in the high season , in order to overcome the imbalance between areas which are literally drowning and others which are seeking to attract tourists , on the promotion of tourist programmes such as the &apos; Ulysses &apos; programme , on educational exchanges and mobility , so that we have certification of professional qualifications and , also , on the structured projection of Europe as a tourist destination with diversity and , of course , on the budget line for tourism in the European Union .
The management plans of the Water Framework Directive need to be supplemented with regard to drought and water scarcity .
There are four priority factors : competitiveness , development of research , training and equal opportunities , and environment protection .
The vote on the motion of censure against the Commission is a political response to that institution &apos;s demonstration of its lack of any sense of political responsibility .
I am sorry to say , for example , that the reform in the judicial system has not made as much progress as was necessary , and certain things still need to be clarified , including the independence of the Judiciary .
The Commission is closely following the ongoing constitutional reform process in Venezuela , as well as in other countries in the region .
We have to find some way of putting pressure on such countries to do just that so we can reconnect with our citizens .
However , I would like to broaden the subject somewhat to include an area which lies particularly close to my heart .
The amendments proposed point in that direction .
the report by Mrs Gräßle and Mr Rivellini , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation ( EC , Euratom ) No 1605 / 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities as regards the European External Action Service - C7 @-@ 0086 / 2010 - ,
Amendments Nos 14 and 22 and the subsequent technical Amendments Nos 11 , 15 , 20 , 23 , 24 and 31 seek to introduce a quite arbitrary maximum level of 0.01 mg / kg for all pesticides and crops , regardless of the permitted uses and toxicological features of individual agents .
This same desire to anticipate the entry into force of the Treaty has been evident in our Parliament &apos;s relations with the national parliaments .
Mr President , on a point of order , could I assure you that I am very calm , but I am not any less angry for that .
I am pleased that all those who have spoken on this item so far are members of that Committee , as indeed is the President chairing today &apos;s proceedings .
The whole idea behind this double @-@ hatting was precisely that the Council and Commission could work better together , and I think it has been demonstrated in this crisis that this has , in fact , been quite an advance .
We take the view that the new accessions represent a historic opportunity to reconcile our continent with its past and that they are needed to define the Europe of the future .
Mr Papayannakis said that there is continuity on major problems .
The joint debate is closed .
International trade is governed by agreements between states , but should CSR be a binding commitment to which those undertakings must sign up ? Or may they comply on a voluntary basis ?
In fact , this vision of the European Union is also held by the large majority of citizens of our Member States for whom our Union is a close partnership of free peoples and states which very clearly respects the principle of subsidiarity .
It is , of course , with great satisfaction that I note the number of positive elements underlined by this report and the progress that has been made during the course of a year , which is relatively short for such a vast and , above all , politically ambitious exercise .
I have a question for the European institutions : how can countries in difficulties bear the scandalous interest rates imposed on them and at the same time reduce their budget deficit and public debt and promote economic growth and create jobs ?
Therefore , our group will be voting against a dual legal base , both for these original amendments , and indeed the recital .
I would also like to know whether any ways out will be sought while reforming the budget , so that in future we can avoid financial crises like the one we are experiencing now ?
When we look at the problems we confront now that the EU has existed for 46 years , we cannot but observe that the whole problem lies in the attempt to solve problems that simply should not be solved .
I am also very pleased that Mr Haarder took up the rights of minority groups .
The new institution that is the African Union now needs to be strengthened and consolidated .
The second fundamental change which I propose is to stipulate accessibility for persons with reduced mobility for all types of vehicle .
We therefore have a host of opportunities for cooperating under the existing rules .
It makes no sense to resort to GMOs in the event of overproduction of natural crops .
That is why we supported the Gallagher report .
We cannot , however , be particularly proud of our work on this occasion .
We cannot assume that work is the only activity that implies that you are a worthy citizen .
That is why I have emphasised this evening that we will make an effort to have it ready as quickly as possible , but the Commission has not yet finished its work on the proposal .
I simply wished to thank the Commissioner for his answers , for his words , and to say that I did not for a moment think that Mr Schmidt &apos;s dismissal had anything to do with the delay in the proposals for reform .
I therefore also voted against the proposal in the final vote .
Mr President , I am grateful for the Commissioner ’ s reply , but , having listened to her , I have the impression that , with regard to this matter , only technical issues have been dealt with , when the reality is that this decision has been the subject of many statements and positions prior to the meeting of the two Presidents which are far from normal .
At the same time , however , the kind of Russia with which we cooperate is equally important .
Our Group has a two @-@ fold demand : on the one hand to the Rwanda government , to cancel its decision and on the other hand to the Tribunal to revise this decision .
The great contribution that the European Parliament makes to our debates is , as a general rule , to find itself on the side of those who want more Europe .
It is a step forward , one that deserves our admiration and our greatest respect .
Today &apos;s order of business features Mr van den Berg ’ s report on the effectiveness of aid and on combating corruption in developing countries , and I too would like to join in the congratulations and gratitude to him that have been expressed ; his report and what he said by way of introduction to it show very well the need for corruption to be fought and prevented for hampering development any longer .
If we do not convince our partners around the world to make equally ambitious adjustments , we will not be able to deal with the problem in spite of our best efforts .
In that sense , of course , no one is questioning the value of the request from the United Nations for a mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
We have asked direct questions and we should have direct answers before we go to vote .
At this point , Mr President , I wished to say , as an aside , that there is a general tendency to exclude Parliament in such procedures and I would refer specifically here to Mr Colajanni &apos;s report on the subject of MEDA .
What is more , how can we explain that a very flexible mandate incompatibility system will preserve overlaps between the offices of members of a national parliament and Members of the European Parliament for a long time to come ?
Mr President , seven political groups came to an agreement to present a joint resolution with which to close the very interesting discussion we had here on Monday on the occasion of International Women &apos;s Day .
I am convinced that , both in the short and longer term , we can establish an effective tool for helping all the people affected .
This is in stark contrast to events in the German Parliament .
He knows that , because in the many exchanges we have had , either in former days in his capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy , or on a more individual basis , we have agreed with him and many Members of this Parliament about the necessity of improving the instruments of our Common Foreign and Security Policy .
I believe that far more research activities are needed to measure the impact of environment and climate policies on employment and I ask the Commission to make this area a priority as part of the Eighth Framework Programme .
The EU is the most important trading partner for most ACP countries .
They should say the same in Brussels as they do at home .
It is the only way to go forward because climate change is a global issue and if we get competitive development in this field , we will definitely be competitive leaders in the world .
On the one hand , to carry out a transfer of appropriations in November which are not going to be used in Category 2 .
The timeframe , together with the possibilities of adapting the present budget , should this appear necessary in April , are therefore crucial to the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance .
Secondly , concentration efforts are distributed equally and fairly among all Member States and are not at the expense of either rural areas or other problem regions .
But the dictator Fidel Castro has betrayed this !
I feel sure that the new government of Bulgaria will respond positively to the points that I have made .
The Minutes of today &apos;s sitting will be submitted to Parliament for its approval at the beginning of its next sitting .
I should add , as our motion states , that a settlement will only come about if no other state unilaterally recognises the legitimacy of either leader .
In the gallery today , we have a group of young people from NEPOMAK , the World Organisation for Young Overseas Cypriots in the UK , who have come to see this declaration announced .
The Commission launched this initiative for two main reasons : to facilitate free movement of trains within the EU by making the procedure for placing locomotives in service more transparent and efficient , and also to simplify regulations by consolidating and merging the three rail interoperability directives into a single directive .
That is why my group also supports amending the Cox report , so that we at least make it obligatory for the Member States of the European Union not to levy taxes on electricity and other products derived from renewable sources of energy .
Any comparison between enterprises or between States thus appears somewhat random .
The European Union should , in my opinion , contribute to the democratisation and strengthening of the multilateral trade system through the reform of the World Trade Organisation for the benefit of the poorest countries .
The industrialised nations are historically responsible for climate change and have a moral duty to contribute to the efforts of the developing countries to adapt to the consequences of climate change .
In anticipation of Parliament &apos;s report , we have already begun working with the Member States to develop further and more clearly the precise information needs at EU level .
More broadly speaking , having listened to Mr Fischler earlier , giving an outline of the general policy , we also wish to stress that good resource management is obviously necessary , but this has to be performed objectively , transparently , involving the professionals and with quota reductions or increases , depending on fluctuations in fish stocks .
Despite the fact , in other words , that there is no legal basis under current provisions , as Presidency I repeat and emphasise that the Presidency will update the House and the House will also have the possibility of expressing its views on the two texts , because we too consider that , on such important issues , there must be continual contact and a two @-@ way exchange of information with the European Parliament .
We also stress that the Community budget should be based on a fair contribution from each country according to its gross national income , therefore firmly rejecting any more or less disguised attempt to introduce European taxes .
We must remember how mad cow disease came about .
And then you go on to tell me - and I quote - on good authority that BIV and the other retroviruses found in animals have no effect on human health .
As a result of the vote given in favour of the report &apos; Europeana - the next steps &apos; and as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , I welcome that this report has been finalised and I hope that its recommendations will be adopted by the Commission .
All neighbouring countries , all countries bordering on Kosovo , with the exception of Milosevic , want three things : they want internal democracy , and they want to secure this by means of external security within NATO and by means of economic development within the European Union .
The formula is simple : that full members of the subcommittees should be full or substitute members of the main committee . In this way we are maintaining the fundamental link I mentioned , and maintaining the principle that the position of chairman of these subcommittees will therefore necessarily fall to members of the main committee , but we are not specifying and therefore leaving the door open to the fact that substitutes who are members of Parliament but not full or substitute members of the main committee may be appointed .
I have a few political comments to make on the actual budget which we are voting on this year and I say political , because the political role of the budget should ultimately be to allow us , through the budget , to play our part as the European Union .
The euro area currently has a sound macroeconomic framework , with low inflation , a strong currency and very low interest rates .
I wish I could say that these procedures always go so swiftly but in this case we have a model where many of the reservations that were stated at the outset , many of the fears of commercial interests , many of the fears of parliamentarians , were set at rest by the way in which these procedures went .
This will be a major contribution to the swift creation of the internal market in financial services .
The packaging manufacturer must ensure that the packaging produced and marketed is in conformity with the requirements of the packaging directive , i.e. Directive 94 / 62 .
I myself , two years ago , was rapporteur on the euro , an extremely important Community service , essential to mobility and to promoting cross @-@ border employment , and I became aware of the widespread lack of knowledge among the public about the euro .
The reason is that the proposal is based on the continued false principle of patching up and mending a non @-@ transparent agricultural policy in the EU instead of taking a joint and radical hold of the issue .
That is all that is needed .
So long as women are refused that access , it will be others who decide about women &apos;s bodies and lives .
These are the main points .
The Commission &apos;s proposal is also completely insufficient for this .
The Roma have inherited a centuries @-@ old culture , and I believe that we should have great respect for nomadic cultures .
Yet if we think back to the last sitting before Christmas , we recall that the majority in this House decided the opposite , under pressure from the Council and the transport lobby – here I am referring to the Eurovignette Directive – thus precluding any chance of recovering external costs , specifically costs to the environment and health .
The Western Sahara in Exile movement has courageously brought this situation to the world &apos;s attention .
I refer to the former President of the Commission , Jacques Delors , whom some of us would have liked to question .
Furthermore , as President @-@ in @-@ Office , I can assure the House that , at all times during the Summit , at every meeting held and in every measure - including bilateral measures - taken or supported by the individual Members of the Union , there was always full coherence and consistency .
I believe that the war against terrorism should be waged without infringing our fundamental freedoms .
There is therefore also a need to avoid adopting a populist stance towards this urgent problem .
Thanks to the authority of their office and the rights that come with it , Members of Parliament can have their voices heard .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs Ferrero @-@ Waldner is unable to attend this meeting .
Decisions must be taken as part of the democratic decision @-@ making process .
Europe is in the process of opening a new chapter in its development .
I am saying this for the benefit of the General Secretariat of the Council , as it does not actually tend to be the Heads of State or Government who obstruct things .
The fears of globalisation or the attempts to gain comparative advantages seem to be making the institutions change their mind and forget that we shall only win the battle through excellence .
Then I note that the report on accession preparations treats Turkey in the same way as the other candidates , the ten plus two , in that way seeming , contrary to what you said , to anticipate the decision to be taken by the Council at the end of 2004 on this issue .
The solvency margin is the additional capital reserve that insurance companies have to create as a buffer against unforeseen events .
I should also like to ask about the blueprint which the EMI is to produce for the future operation of the European Central Bank .
- ( EL ) Mr President , the Council &apos; s legislative proposal on the adoption by Greece of the single currency on 1 January 2001 is a positive proposal which responds to the objectives of the European Union to strengthen social and economic cohesion through Economic and Monetary Union .
This has been caused not only by the global economic crisis and recession , along with a contraction of domestic and external markets , but also by the common agricultural policy , a neo @-@ liberal policy which the European Commission has continued to pursue in previous years .
Therefore , for the sake of the consensus that has existed around this whole report , we ask the rapporteur and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to consider this and think about withdrawing Amendments 11 and 12 , which our group will not support .
Tourist companies are faced with a totally uncoordinated and inefficient EU tourism policy .
I hope that the other groups will agree with the PPE @-@ DE Group on that issue .
I would also like to reiterate that &apos; education and training are the fundamental preconditions for the development of the EU and can make it more competitive in the face of global challenges &apos; .
The Commission informs me that it does not wish to speak again .
The Union &apos;s current action plan on drugs comes to an end this year .
There are many countries , such as my own , whose greenhouse gas emissions have increased - excessively , to my mind .
We also support the various internal parliamentary initiatives on the revocation of the death penalty law that are currently being debated in the Philippines Congress , and we encourage the efforts by civil society to work towards that goal .
Our principle of human security is one which obliges us to respond to the humanitarian crisis , but it also obliges us to respond and tell Israel that enough is enough and that no more can Europe turn a blind eye to the abuse of the Palestinian right to self @-@ determination .
This Parliament &apos;s Committee on Budgets , and latterly also the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education and the Media , have made efforts over the past few years to improve the information policy .
You now have the report you reminded us about concerning lending activity , but it will probably not be possible to produce the publication you suggest about the ECSC &apos;s activities since its formation in 1952 in all official languages by the end of this year because some of the posts have already gone to other services .
No parliamentary group appealed to the nation &apos; s Supreme Court of Justice , the body authorised to settle such matters , on grounds of unconstitutionality .
There is still far more that we can do in this area than has been done to date , and that is through research into them , into the conditions to be imposed on them and how best to promote them , so that we can involve these alcohol products , too , in an ecological approach to our surroundings and thereby find new trade outlets for our agricultural sector .
You negotiate with third country partners ; you set the terms of cooperation .
The second thing I have to mention is that , during the first reading , we tabled a number of amendments to Article 27 , in actual fact emphasising the aspect of labour market conditions .
As we know , doubts about the commitment of the IRA continued to exist , 10 years on .
The internal European market may act as an important lever and , by contrast , any protectionist measure will only exacerbate things .
Of course , this is all in the interests of the security of the Israeli State .
Satisfactorily , I think , although there is room for some small improvements , which I shall suggest .
I am sure that was also the impression made on the many groups of visitors who had the opportunity to follow the debate on the findings of the Committee of Inquiry into bovine spongiform encephalopathy or , more popularly , BSE .
However , we must put a stop to the discrimination of women , both within and outside our society , and we must take decisive action on this front .
– Mrs Kauppi , I fully understand that point . I have no wish to contest the view of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
It is clear that another aspect , namely safety , should also be Europeanised .
But equally this brings the whole of the type @-@ approval process into the focus of many small and medium @-@ sized businesses .
The introduction of new costings for landfills must get under way very soon in the Member States .
The world stood horrified and helpless , yet still today , there are more than a quarter of a million Sri Lankan citizens who are interned without adequate medical facilities , without clean water , sanitation or living space .
Of course , the need to strengthen it was emphasised a great many times and I hope , as Mr Libicki and Mr Kroupa said earlier , that we shall be able to make Europe and our countries better for us and our children and that we shall be able to live with the democracy , security and freedom which the European Union and the common wish of all the peoples of Europe guarantee us , without sacrificing freedoms .
I must insist once again on the urgency of the proposals and the urgent need for us to continue truly creating a new area where there is only room and freedom of movement for those of us who want to live in peace and freedom .
This must be accompanied by an integrated long @-@ term strategy of waste management with the aim of promoting recycling and sorting of refuse upon collection .
This is evidence of the way in which the EU ’ s procedures lack transparency and clarity .
A ray of hope - albeit a long way off - could be my miracle .
As regards all these points , Mr President , the Member States meeting at the Council must take things in hand without delay .
Approximately 3 000 people are currently under house arrest according to Nepalese Government sources .
Denmark has proposed that more far @-@ reaching measures be taken at EU level to fight environmental crime .
With Europe in the throes of a major crisis , we need to be capable of defining a growth strategy , as I said earlier .
I wish to thank the President @-@ in @-@ Office for his very comprehensive reply .
The Commission is therefore proposing the creation of a specifically European Fund ( COPE ) , which would operate on the principle of the Member States standing in for the parties involved in acts of oil pollution .
After all , the EUR 25 billion available so far could comfortably cover the cost of the urgent assistance given to Romania .
But the big question for us is whether it will be possible to show that the European Union , and the other major parties to the Protocol , are prepared to take decisions without the United States .
&lt; empty &gt;
To conclude , our group places much emphasis on the need to retain the precautionary principle so as to guarantee both consumer and environmental protection .
( DE ) Madam President , the plundering of commodities , strategic interests , climate change and , not least , increasing tourism are driving this sensitive ecosystem to the brink of destruction .
You will all remember that during the last summit between the European Union and the United States in London , the Council , particularly France , withheld its approval and presented a new plan that was less ambitious .
This is the essence and the strength of Europe .
On the contrary , the principle , established by the United Nations and confirmed by the Brussels European Council last November , of increasing the funds made available to support developing countries to 0.7 % of GDP must be converted into a practical commitment , and Europe must proceed in the same way and with the same determination as when it respected the Maastricht parameters and introduced the single currency .
Secondly , on the question of overall coherence , conceivably , things have changed since I was a British development minister many years ago .
That is something I wanted to explain to you , as the coming days will certainly see wide @-@ ranging international discussion of this question .
The reason for that is that the Council would like to decide on this matter before 1 July , which leaves us plenty of time , even if we do not decide on urgent procedure today .
In this context , the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is an important step forward for Serbia on the road to the European Union .
The second reason is that the draft Statute included in this report adds provisions to the Treaty establishing the European Community , to the 1976 Act and to the Protocol on the privileges and immunities of the European Communities - something it does not have the power to do .
14 .
Member of the Commission . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I shall be very brief .
The commitment of the countries in the region to implement institutional policy reforms and to create an environment allowing economic progress is a fundamental element in this Pact .
For some theological reason which I , and I suspect the majority of members of the Council , do not fully understand , there was a reluctance to accept our amendments .
More specifically , the Commission &apos;s policy aims to guarantee that social economy enterprises can grow and prosper alongside other forms of company .
Currently , the Commission seems to be severely affected by its management problems , not to mention fraud , and the reforms envisaged by the work programme do not measure up to the size of the problem .
Those are the difficulties we may still continue to see in the future but our response must be , as the President of this Parliament on his recent visit to Belfast said , there will always be attempts to stop the process reaching a peaceful settlement .
The agricultural crisis of 2009 is having a much more detrimental effect on farms than the indices reveal .
If this is the case , the airlines have the right to claim protection from their authorities , as do , it goes without saying , the Union &apos;s citizens .
Therefore we need to integrate policies on a horizontal and vertical plane .
What about China ?
The Council and the Commission initially had very great ambitions , particularly after 11 September , but these gradually evaporated .
On 24 June , the coordinators of the Committee on the Environment did in fact discuss the Commission &apos;s decision on the sale of genetically modified maize , but the proposal has not been examined in committee .
The spate of mergers , takeovers and transfers that we are experiencing with the deepening of the market means that we must act to update the matrix of information and consultation directives that we have adopted in the past ; but we must also complement them with the new general framework of information and consultation and an updating of the works council directive .
Changes to the climate of the planet , on the other hand , are a global issue .
It appears that there is already political agreement on the need to create a new SIS - this is a Council decision with a legal basis for the development of SIS @-@ II , and with the necessary budget .
It is a European subject , and that is why I am sorry that you have dragged it down to the level of internal politics with your proposals .
We also welcome the call for greater honesty from Member States about the need for migrant workers in our current economies .
Mrs Buffet has been tackling this issue in France , and I congratulate her for it .
That is a good proposal , and a much @-@ needed step forward .
What has got to happen ?
I hope you are in agreement .
The coordinator Mrs van Miert has been monitoring the project since 2005 , I believe with positive results .
We expect the June session of the European Council to debate these issues in detail on the basis of the proposal put forward by our Polish colleagues .
Generally speaking , I am sure that we will have to change our lifestyle and limit our extravagant consumption in the future .
This is where Europe can play its trump cards - economic strength , a talent for innovation , technological capacity and vision .
Minister , we have noted in recent days that the President of the United States has been in discussions with certain leaders in the developing world .
However in relation to the 6 dates he mentioned on RTEs liveline programmes , he was inaccurate in at least half of them .
It is now integrated within the comprehensive migration policy of the European Union .
In order to get there on time , I must leave for the airport at 7.00 p.m.
So this area must be promoted on the basis of a few , very few , but solid and identifiable European political projects which deal with the real problems facing us , the first of which is Islamist terrorism .
We must point out that , since the beginning of the crisis , the European Union has closely coordinated its actions with NATO on this matter , by holding joint , regular and frequent meetings between the Atlantic Council and the Political and Security Committee , by regular liaison between various Secretariats , and by direct contact between Mr Solana and the NATO Secretary @-@ General , Lord Robertson .
Baroness Ludford , we must refrain , quite categorically , from comparing National Socialism and the persecution of the Jews by the National Socialists in Germany with any other situation .
However , on 8 July , the Council agreed to set up a high @-@ level working party appointed by ministers and assisted by the Commission and the European Investment Bank to examine this contentious issue and to make recommendations before the informal Ecofin Council in Dublin in September .
On more specific issues , such as harmonisation of withdrawal rights across the acquis , the definition of delivery of goods or the drawing up of a combined grey and black list of unfair contract terms at EU level , the majority of respondents to the Green Paper have expressed views which are largely in line with the report to be voted on today .
I would therefore like to ask Mr Dalli the following question . Would the Commission consider the development of a stand @-@ alone proposal on e @-@ health , fostering cooperation and enabling interoperability of data and safety for patients , thus making it a reality in Europe ?
This spring , the European Council has proven that there is a light at the end of the tunnel .
Our committee has called on the Council and the Commission to adopt the necessary measures to eliminate these obstacles .
Preparations have been made for its expiry , and in the last few years , the ECSC has not collected tax payments from companies in the coal and steel industry to finance its operations .
We should be aware of this and try to do things to counteract that as well .
This applies to Kosovo , to the Balkans and to any budget heading .
Overall , I am pleased to see Parliament addressing the issue of transparency , but we must also ensure that the organisations who lobby us are just as transparent as we are .
Turkey has no business in joining the European Union .
We in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance have put forward a compromise amendment involving a maximum of four months , with the further limitations described by Mrs Breyer .
It must be made clear that the European Community is committed not to rearmament , but to disarmament , as I have already said .
Secondly , whether the Commissioner is aware that in the Dutch coalition agreement includes a reduction in the contribution of NLG 1.2 billion .
Please take the floor .
The rapporteur stressed all this and also explained that any harsh statements he made apply to those in power in a Turkey under military control and not to the Turkish people , who have themselves had much to put up with .
We intend instead to promote early diagnosis and quality of life , improve epidemiological knowledge of the disease and coordinate existing research , while supporting solidarity between the Member States through sharing best practices .
I believe it is important in this context to point out that we must look at energy policy in terms of a number of different objectives .
For that reason , it is imperative to open dialogue between all the parties , the Chad Government , the opposition and the rebels , to which they committed themselves with a view to free elections in 2009 , in accordance with international standards .
We are particularly concerned about the implications for a wide range of the programmes that fall within our remit .
Two months ago there was a large meeting with eight European organisations of elderly people .
I am disappointed that the Commission is willing to accept only 3 of this House ’ s 22 amendments , which , let me add , I was happy to support .
It would also be in society &apos;s interests for the Member States to set up large @-@ scale projects to build low @-@ cost , high @-@ quality accommodation .
So the natural answer to your question is &apos; yes &apos; .
This criminal military action forms part of a long @-@ planned Israeli strategy to destroy the Palestinian Authority , its institutions and its structures , including those that meet the people ’ s most basic needs .
Ladies and gentlemen , the European Union must profit fully from all of these four lessons .
We find this , for example , within the framework of the financial implications .
In fact , we managed to establish a close political dialogue with the SADC region at political level during the difficult months - winter and early spring - this year , but we need to move that discussion further in order to try to create a positive influence on the situation in Zimbabwe .
Why is it that the Commission and others were not , perhaps , able to get their voices heard sufficiently in the press ?
We must not forget , however , that the principle of degressive proportionality has a deep justification .
In my view , that is the context surrounding this Commission communication , in which the next financial perspective must address the new circumstances .
The overwhelming majority of the Member States are in favour of the Constitution .
I believe that this is a serious accusation which implies a lack of trust in your fellow Member Mr Trittin who , as German Federal Environment Minister , was responsible for this regulatory body in Germany for seven years .
It would appear that the Council wishes to trim this proposal to the bone and to include neither the social security directives nor indirect forms of discrimination in this directive .
The data protection instruments address it , but call it &apos; Prohibition of Automated Processing &apos; : that means that EU data protection legislation prevents any individual from being subject to a decision which produces legal effects concerning him or her , or significantly affects him or her , and which is based solely on the automated processing of data .
Europe played an important role in the conference regarding this choice of direction , by holding a dialogue with China on its crucial opening @-@ up and sidelining the Bush Administration ’ s attempt to sabotage the talks .
Parliament must set an example , for us to recover from the financial crisis and regain the public &apos;s confidence .
Emissions trading must be built on the principle of equal per capita entitlements ; this is very important to bear in mind as we go to Kyoto .
It is happening in front of our eyes .
Digital technology is making great strides all around us , but it is still not perfect . We must help to improve digitisation .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the unprecedented humanitarian disaster in Haiti affects us deeply and the European Union has a duty to contribute as best it can to the efforts by the international community , using all the tools at its disposal .
We know that this is not the constitution of a European federal state ; it is the constitution of a union of citizens and states , which will always be more than just provinces of a Federal Republic of Europe .
I should like to add that the fight against AIDS is also an issue of governance , which must be dealt with at local level .
I support a democratic and comprehensive policy for genetically modified products .
I should just like to say briefly that the Nice Summit was held against a background of total indifference on the part of the citizens of Europe , despite the fact that it has serious repercussions for them , and total indifference on the part of the governments towards the citizens of Europe .
Cultural activity is an expression of individuality , of an individual &apos; s own personality ; it builds relationships and communicates .
That is all I wish to put before the House in my capacity as rapporteur .
Mr Vanhecke represents 30 % of voters in my country , in the Flanders part .
Is there an emergency action package or provisions for specific countries ?
Thank you , Mrs Gradin .
However , this report is also an opportunity for the European Parliament , which is the only effective , democratic body able to discuss this issue in European terms and put forward European recommendations .
Here as I speak , the museum in Cairo is in flames , fighting is breaking out in the streets , and I believe that , in the case of Egypt at least , we have not been clear enough .
For another thing , there are quantitative differences in the budgets .
I want to confirm that the Commission is able to accept the three amendments contained in the report ; they correspond to the compromise between our three institutions .
( EL ) Madam President , Commissioner , I should like once again to congratulate you on the Commission &apos;s initiative to table the White Paper on Sport before Parliament and , as rapporteur of the European Parliament , I should like to ask the following supplementary question : as both Nicolas Sarkozy and José Barroso told us yesterday , the Reform Treaty will be applied , provided that it is approved by Ireland , by the end of 2009 , and sport is therefore now an active aspect and part of the Lisbon or Reform Treaty .
The European Union and Africa are frequently out of harmony on these matters .
I fully agree with the amendment tabled by my colleagues from the Green Group on the revision , with this in mind , of the World Trade Organisation standards .
Every day , men and women suffer discrimination when they try to access jobs and services , particularly due to their sex , their origin or their religion .
I presume that he will follow through his enquiry as to why this question was asked .
This is the first observation that I would like to make with regard to this report .
It is a disgrace for us to give ourselves a pat on the back and say that we have done a good job when , in actual fact , controls on the legality of timber from the European Union market remain extremely lax .
All that we want to do today is to remind you that this request is not about protectionism ; it is not industries that are no longer able to compete on the international market that we want to defend , but consumers : we want to draw attention to the theme of health , the environment and genuine reciprocity on the world market , which is lacking today .
I am glad that we are able to welcome another woman to the podium .
At the moment , there are shortcomings in both of these areas .
I believe that the tax must be levied where the transaction takes place , and must also , in other words , benefit the States on whose territory the relevant stock exchanges are located .
Finally , regarding the harmonised energy tax , we too are in favour of a tax of this kind , but provided it is fiscally neutral .
What freedom ? That , I will leave you to imagine .
By covering substances and preparations ( such as glues , household cleaning products and paints ) the Commission &apos;s proposal addresses the situations most likely to lead to exposure of consumers .
I believe , therefore , that it is our duty to adopt provisions designed to preserve the marine world which surrounds us , and so I call on the Commission to abide by the deadlines which it announced in this Chamber for making the move from studies to concrete proposals .
I would have liked the President of the European Parliament , after the vote on Wednesday , to call for a lunchtime demonstration in support of peace in the Middle East .
It will highlight the benefits of diversity as a source of social and economic vitality , which Europe must acknowledge and make use of .
This is why I believe that the only possible response is global and proactive action by the European Union . Over and above the economic and financial issues , which are clearly very important , is the key issue of our cultures , identities and the values we hold dear .
The EU and India are predestined to be economic partners , with the EU being India ’ s largest trading partner , and , as has already been mentioned , with India investing massively in Europe .
Our position on the promotion of effective regional cooperation among the Member States is a highly significant aspect of securing a true internal cross @-@ border market .
The Olympic Games should be a well @-@ used opportunity for us to speak about peace , freedom and human dignity all over the world , in China first and foremost .
However , the Commission considers that Amendment Nos 49 and 50 , 52 , 54 , 56 , 59 to 61 , 64 , 65 , 68 to 73 , 77 , 79 , 80 , 82 to 85 , 89 , 93 , 94 , 96 , 99 , 101 , 104 to 106 , 110 to 112 , 114 and 117 are not compatible with the proposal &apos;s scope , intention and legal basis and should not be accepted .
I want to point out in relation to the report for which I am the rapporteur that I think it is the first one that a Community institution has drawn up on globalisation in fisheries , and therefore I think our Committee has hit the nail on the head with the two own @-@ initiative reports it has decided to produce ; the other one is still in progress .
It is not a security problem , but a political problem .
That is why I am disappointed . However , I also had reasons to be pleased .
I ask you to vote against this part of the sentence because I think that cooperation of this kind , focused on the fight against crime , must begin immediately , whatever the conditions prevailing in the country concerned .
Unless this sector is strengthened , we shall not achieve any real progress .
I would remind you that in accordance with Article 109k ( 2 ) , which lays down the procedure for entry into EMU for Member States with a derogation , the Commission and the European Central Bank must report to the Council at least once every two years or at the request of the Member State concerned .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon .
When will we discuss this in detail in Parliament ?
You said that Europe is very distant from its citizens ; that is indeed the case , and we will have to give some thought to how we can , together , improve that , but the same can be said of politics at the national level too .
I should like to finish by thanking the members of the delegation office there who were so helpful to us .
The politicians do not want to have to explain how the new Treaty will change the Member States &apos; share in decision @-@ making within the EU .
It is time for economic operations based on extraordinary measures or creative accounting to disappear for good , because they undermine credibility and erode the trust of investors and consumers .
Unfortunately , even today , after so many reports on the implementation of law , a huge delay can be seen in control by the Commission of the method of implementation and the judicial and administrative authorities do not have assimilation mechanisms and have not assimilated Community law .
Why can the EU as such not deploy more troops under the UN flag with a UN mandate ?
One example is the renowned civil peace corps which Parliament has requested a number of times and which is mentioned in paragraph five of this proposal for a resolution .
Resumption of the session
There , we also discussed all the possibilities , but would you really think that we can give everything to every country without them doing their part ?
Its rapid growth of jurisdiction is the political mystery of the age .
&apos;Concerning the proposal for a directive to establish a new financial services committee organisational structure , presented by the Commission on 5 November 2003 , I would like to clarify a few points which have been raised during the contacts between the Council and the European Parliament .
First of all , I think that we need to pursue our important achievements since 11 September 2001 , mainly the transposition into the national legal systems of the framework decision on the definition of terrorism , and the transposition into national law of the framework decision concerning the European arrest warrant .
We also regret that the Commission &apos;s Work and Legislative Programme overlooks the situation in the Middle East , and we find it unacceptable that financial cooperation has not been set up between the EU and the Palestinian Authority .
The rapporteur cannot be blamed for this , as he drafted a sound report in the shortest possible time .
At the same time , I regret that as a result of the heavy resistance of a number of Member States , among others , certain points were not included in the compromise .
We look forward , even in the few months available , to some of the pressing , outstanding issues being resolved and to our achieving a budget at the end of the year .
From this perspective , therefore , I believe it is absolutely vital for the Council to carry out a thorough examination of the issue with a view to promoting an increase in the number of languages used on Presidency websites .
Well , because an Ombudsman is there to ensure that people can demand their rights in political and bureaucratic structures that are becoming ever more complex and , thus , non @-@ transparent .
The Bureau congratulates Mrs Mouskouri .
As regards chemical substance limits , Mr Buşoi , it is true that a migration @-@ based method is preferable from a scientific point of view , because it is based on the real risk to which children are exposed .
All things considered , we must respect the results .
This would be supplemented by an annual survey of Community environmental law containing further information on the activities of IMPEL , for example , as Mrs van Putten was requesting , the results achieved by the Member States with regard to reporting obligations under EU law , and on relations with the European Environment Agency , as Mrs Gebhardt mentioned .
Approval of the EC model of measurement means at the EU level that Member States are allowed to carry out initial screening , or , where it is not mandatory , instruments can be released to the market and used .
We are aware that the decision may be felt to be onerous for certain manufacturers . It is nonetheless our conviction that Swedish industry , with its considerable technical know @-@ how , is well placed to cope with these demands within the time frame proposed in the report , which is to say by 2006 .
The global fight against infectious diseases is a very important issue demanding extensive international commitment .
Structural reforms to promote employment and social inclusion must also be implemented .
We would finally like to stress the need to develop a new political doctrine for the Union in terms of both the content of the negotiations and democratic control .
That is the real cause of the deaths off the coast of Libya a few days ago .
We know , though , that the law is flouted in too many cases .
Let us not be motivated by personal ambitions .
I voted against it also because I do not think that in such a document there should be direct references to individual Member States and their governments or that they should be exhorted to follow different approaches , since everything rests in the hands of the voters who elected these governments .
What is clearly important is to create more free trade .
Bangladesh ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 1984 .
It has also urged Turkish leaders to withdrawn military forces from Iraqi territories as soon as possible .
Here I would like to thank all my colleagues very warmly for their effective cooperation on this issue , and Mr Westendorp and Mr Fernández Martín for their excellent work too .
I also consider it important to define the conditions under which a Member State may refuse to grant prior consent .
I hope that the Commission will read the report by the Conseil d &apos;Analyse Economique , a high @-@ powered economic committee of the French Government chaired by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin .
According to recent reports from Teheran , many pro @-@ Western Iranians consider this development to be the gradual victory of barbarism over civilisation .
We must not fail to also mention the missed opportunity of Amsterdam when we should at least have outlined an institutional architecture suited to the continent and resolutely moved towards a federal model , instead of adopting a unique structure whose limitations are constantly being revealed .
Those of you who wish to come to a swift agreement with the Council on a Members &apos; Statute must not , at tomorrow &apos;s vote , approve the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs in its current form as this report would obviously rule out the prospect of reaching an effective agreement on a statute .
To be very explicit , I wanted to ask the Council exactly what actions are planned to ensure that as many Member States and candidate countries as possible sign this Convention .
There are none .
African trypanosomiasis , better known by the name sleeping sickness , is a good example of this .
The problem , Commissioner , is that currently we have consistent case law from the Court of Justice that states that workers from one country may work in another country for less than 50 % of the salary , under a directive which , it has to be said , was created precisely to prevent this .
Pictures of hundreds of fishermen sewing together an enormous net four kilometres long to create an amateur device for holding back the oil speak volumes . So do pictures of people on beaches armed with buckets and spades .
The first is the inactive part of on @-@ call time .
It does not matter if they are small , medium @-@ sized or large enterprises .
We must make an unambiguous commitment .
I shall try and draw my remarks briefly to a conclusion because I am conscious of the constraints of time .
However , we are considering a very important report .
Making provision for parental leave for Commission staff for the first time , improving working conditions and facilitating flexible employment arrangements such as part @-@ time working are crucial to achieving equality of opportunity and practice and to improving career development .
Past experience has shown us that you cannot leave it to commercial interests to resolve this problem .
In relation to access to documents , you are making an extremely restrictive interpretation of the regulation .
The EU is 20 billion euro short of its funding commitments , at a time when states are cutting back their aid budgets .
Members have a variety of names for this attendance @-@ checking procedure - some of them rather rude - but you mentioned a new rule and change of rules .
Particular importance attaches to good working conditions and , above all , job security for all those who work in the postal services .
The Commission is ready to continue its lead role on the subject in collaboration with the Member States and other interested development agencies , taking into account the concerns and recommendation of the European Parliament .
However , I should also like to take advantage of this speech , if you will allow me to do so , Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , strongly to condemn , on behalf of the Presidency , the violent events of this morning in Istanbul , whose victims were police officers on duty outside the United States Embassy in Istanbul .
Finally , in order to bring more stability to the region , the policy of opening the EU to the Western Balkans should not stop here .
Furthermore , we must at last hold that complex and comprehensive debate on choosing technologies for the future and on the production and use of alternative and renewable energies .
The Northern Ireland Executive has now offered the farmers 25 % compensation , which will mean ruin for them .
I think it is very important that mental health has been included for the first time as an area for action under a public health programme .
I know we can talk about a lot of things , but you are duty @-@ bound to assist .
And we addressed two other issues which I think would definitely be postponed if they did not have support from the Community : firstly , offshore wind energy , which is rather a large project that needs to be connected to the mainland grid , and , secondly , carbon capture and storage , where we really need to encourage industry to come with a full @-@ scale project as soon as possible .
In preparation for its &apos; Standardisation Package &apos; , the Commission has asked key experts to make strategic recommendations .
Most of the Member States of the European Union support these basic principles .
In the discussion of previous reports of this House about Romania as a candidate country , I asked for attention to be paid to violations of the freedom of the press .
Honourable Members , I should like to thank you for holding this long , interesting and very thorough debate .
Thank you very much .
We therefore fail to understand why our few requests relating to the coming year &apos;s budget , which primarily concern staffing , have obviously fallen foul of the restrictions and tight constraints governing administrative expenditure .
The Libyan people do not enjoy basic human rights and freedoms , despite the fact that their state has specific international obligations to respect human rights , having been recently elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council and having ratified a number of legally binding international instruments .
Today &apos;s achievement , which we have noted , is essentially that this horizontal cooperation presents a great opportunity , and with the next composition of Parliament we ought to make sure that people talk to each other more and that we do not just have individual groups opposing each other .
For example , we are currently talking about imposing a tax on the financial sector .
I support the rapporteur in her attempts to deal with cable monopolies as well and to push for statutory measures aimed at protecting freedom and diversity of opinion in the media .
– Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to address a number of remarks by previous speakers relating to firms ’ need for leeway and room to manoeuvre , and to their productivity .
We should also not forget that workers represent human capital for a company .
As a doctor , I firmly believe that public health issues should never play a part in international relations , and the European Parliament , to its credit , has consistently rejected Beijing &apos;s petty policy of blocking Taiwan &apos;s attempts to be present at WHA meetings .
For the new standards to be introduced , the technical support provided by the underlying computer system , that is the information technology , will also have to be modernised .
Report Schmidt ( A5 @-@ 0324 / 2001 ) :
Another important point is the principle of regionalisation .
My recommendation , which was not accepted by the committee , was that the Stabilisation and Association Agreements should be successfully implemented over a period of years .
The Minutes of the previous sitting are approved .
In order to implement the Agreement , a Joint Committee will be set up , which will ensure the involvement of Israeli officials in the administrative committees and the participation of experts to give their expertise and in programme committees .
This therefore justifies the need to give the Commission a development mandate valid for the development of the system until it becomes operational .
I fully agree with the position expressed by our Council President , but I would like to mention a few other things also .
The enlargement will increase our opportunities for greater efforts against international terrorism and more effective combating of international crime , including human trafficking .
With regard to the remit of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , as provided for by the Treaties , we have to recognise the value of its work in 2007 .
I see here some familiar faces , some less familiar , and a number of issues which are apparently still recurring .
This vote should send out a strong signal that no one should continue to abuse foreign workers by offering worse conditions than those offered to local workers .
I will give only one example out of the many I could give - the priority given to cooperation in fighting urban youth crime seems a little odd and out of place , given that , to make any real impact , the States would do better to join forces in order to defeat large @-@ scale organised crime , which increasingly operates on an international basis .
I think that the Commission should analyse these proposals , because models do exist .
The Council is also prepared to adopt the recitals and statements , which are an essential part of the conciliation package and which leave scope for negotiation , which we will be entering into next year regarding category 4 financing , such as that which affects the Western Balkans .
in writing . - I support Catherine Ashton as the new Trade Commissioner .
All the language versions will be available tomorrow morning .
We must make this partnership a positive and constructive one .
Our fine words are worth nothing if we do not have the cooperation of city mayors .
I think that the White Paper is in general a good thing but I also think that what we have now put on the table adds something extra .
When it comes to the giving of discharge for the coming year , Commissioner , we will be casting an eye over what happens when payments are made in future , and what will be done about delays to this programme , and I also hope that our rapporteur will be examining it with great care .
on behalf of the PSE @-@ Group . - Mr President , I totally agree with our colleague , Mr Caspary , that we should postpone not only the final vote on the resolution but also the vote on his report - the assent report - because it was very clear in yesterday &apos;s debate that the Council in particular was not prepared to give the European Parliament sufficient opportunity and the possibility to really monitor the situation in Turkmenistan and have an impact on the situation there on the basis of such an agreement .
Highly qualified workers will be the economic driving force for the European Union , according to the Lisbon Strategy and the most recent meetings devoted to vocational training .
Mr President , I would like to wish the Slovenian Presidency the best of luck at the start of their Presidency and their first Question Time .
On a number of occasions you have publicly supported US policies and have come out in favour of a further transfer of powers from the Member States to the Union , a Union that will centralise and manage the future of the peoples of Europe without regard for traditions or identities .
Do not forget why Theo Van Gogh is dead .
You have done an immense amount of tireless work , taking a pragmatic view and always working in favour of the European Union and the values on which it is based .
. The Council has never debated this question and it is not within the sphere of its competence .
I should also like to mention that in the past , within the framework of our relations with Egypt , we created the socalled Social Fund , as part of the process by which Egypt &apos;s economy is being opened up , following that country &apos;s negotiations with the Bretton Woods institutions . Of this project , which amounts to approximately ECU 70 million ( if my memory is correct ) a large part has been devoted specifically to helping the Egyptian Government reform its whole system of vocational training .
Animal nutrition inspections
It is a country in which the men have not learned to work .
I should like to make one comment to the rapporteur , Mr Torres Couto , concerning a remark , which I may have misunderstood , as I cannot accept a criticism that you may have made .
We are at a point in time when digital technology and the Internet are creating both huge opportunities and enormous challenges for Europe &apos;s cultural and creative sectors .
That said , we must not be under any illusions . There is relatively little room for manoeuvre within the terms of the monetary and budgetary policies .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the full extent of the instability sensed on the global financial markets is not yet clear .
This situation was caused by previously established international trade agreements , which allowed the EU to protect its cereal production and , in return , allowed duty @-@ free imports of oilseed and protein crops into the EU .
Had Ireland not already been part of the Eurozone , it would not have been able to join today under the current regulations .
The amendment on dignity for seafarers , their pay and valuing their work should also be supported .
There is therefore much to do in Europe , but we must clearly make far @-@ reaching changes beginning with training for those working in these sectors , first modernizing and updating our industries -and I want to mention oil tankers .
The people of Zimbabwe deserve better , and they must get it .
For us , and in every border region , it is unacceptable that it is the licence plate that determines whether or not a serious offence is punished .
The energy situation which prevails today both in the European Union and in the rest of the world demands well supported and coordinated actions .
Today , it is the people of the coastal States , European citizens , who are asking you , Commissioner , to be uncompromising .
The European Union must support Kosovo in its endeavours to become a European democratic state .
It transpires from these documents that , at its inception , there was no legal basis for the CFP .
Unfortunately , there is no Richter scale to gauge the extent of the institutional , economic , social and cultural devastation brought about by almost ten years of dictatorship under Alberto Fujimori and his henchman , Vladimiro Montesinos .
Clearly , there has been a problem and there still is , not just of communication but also of democratic participation , not the participation envisaged by the violent antiglobalisation protesters but the participation that we see in national parliaments .
However , this enlargement must take place in a structured fashion and at a steady pace in the interests of both the Union and the applicant countries .
How can we claim to legitimise a budget discipline when the Union shamelessly cultivates fiscal competitiveness ?
Acting at this level therefore aids and strengthens Europe as a political entity , but most of all it strengthens the idea of a Europe that is useful to its citizens .
With regard to the issue of a conflict between the rulings of the Court in Strasbourg and rulings in Luxembourg , it is worth noting that today , under Community law , the Court of Justice of the European Communities always refers to the European Convention on Human Rights , to actual decisions by the European Court of Human Rights , as the source of inspiration for decisions by the Court of Justice of the European Communities on fundamental rights issues .
In view of the direct relation to areas and the area effect of regional and structural policy , and of the increasing importance of the regions , which is always emphasized in the context of subsidiarity , it is considered right and necessary to supplement these efforts by formulating and introducing region @-@ specific matters .
My group therefore warmly supports this resolution .
Talking and planning is one thing - especially if you can do it in a meeting room somewhere else in Europe - but implementing and changing requires greater conviction .
This is where the errors arise from .
Mr President , the improvement of Europe ’ s economy and of its citizens ’ standard of living depends on all the economic entities acquitting themselves well on the global market .
Let me tell Mr Fassa that Mr Ajello &apos;s objective is precisely to support and coordinate diplomatic action whether that of the United Nations , the Organization of African Unity or of the Carter Centre .
That is what should be done - that is what you would have to accept if you were logical and consistent in your own actions .
They are exactly the same as the rules in operation in Germany since the foundation of the Bundesbank after the Second World War .
Equality is not a women &apos; s issue and can only be achieved through cooperation between both sexes .
Otherwise , we are likely to witness the steady decline of the European Union .
We must live in a positive way .
Another important point to be included in this matter is a discussion about the role of national parliaments in the process of working out decisions coming under the principle of subsidiarity .
Would it not perhaps be useful for the Commission to try to come to a general agreement at least with the states that have already applied for membership of the European Union , in other words with the 11 states that really do want relations with us ?
Turning to the roles I mentioned , I believe that monitoring internal markets in gas and electricity , participating in the development of network codes , contributing to the implementation of the guidelines on trans @-@ European energy networks , monitoring progress on implementation of projects to create new interconnector capacity , having the power to decide on exemptions from requirements for investments in infrastructure , monitoring implementation of the 10 @-@ year network investment plans and having powers to issue opinions and recommendations to TSOs - along with other aspects that I do not have the time to enumerate - will all give the Agency ample opportunities to bring about change .
In Berlin we wanted to secure the financial bases of the Union up to the year 2006 with Agenda 2000 , with particular reference to the tasks relating to enlargement .
I would encourage the parties involved to engage in a peace dialogue by once again entering negotiations with the African Union .
I fully agree that violence against children and against women is an unacceptable breach of their rights as human beings .
Our ten new Member States – to whose number Romania and Bulgaria are soon to be added – give us incredible potential , with a very large number of plots of land capable of being set aside for the production of energy rather than of foodstuffs , and the agricultural specifications have been chosen in such a way as to make this possible .
Our measure gives those businesses particular protection .
The European project can only succeed if we show zero tolerance for fraud , nepotism and corruption . Otherwise , we shall never get the people on our side .
But I perhaps would come to a different conclusion : that far from accelerating the process we need to take a great deal more time and trouble on a programme of public education to make sure that before we make a final and irrevocable move , consumers and citizens - particularly the elderly and those who are not so used to using the telephone - are absolutely sure what the emergency numbers are and what the procedures are for using those emergency numbers , both for fixed point telephones and mobile telephones .
The Commission can accept Amendment No 15 in part .
This degree of freedom of movement obviously depends on broad @-@ based trust between the states concerned .
– Mr President , given my institutional role in the European Parliament , I should be speaking about the failure of the Brussels summit in relation to cohesion , a failure which saddens us all and creates problems with the timely start of the programmes for the new period , for 2007 @-@ 2013 , in connection with the Community Support Framework and regional policy .
Therefore , this communication from the Commission has been eagerly awaited by the Roma themselves , of course , and by all their supporters and anyone who attaches importance to the European Union &apos;s fundamental values .
We must resume our work on light arms trafficking .
However , it would be a big mistake to turn away before addressing the long @-@ term causes of this problem .
We could have asked ourselves what type of Europe we wanted to build .
The demolition of the bridge on Ledra Street is a sign of hope .
In this respect , I can only say that we should be delighted that we are able to conclude this agreement , and that in so doing we are giving a sign to Mr Nasarbajev and his people , thereby leading to a political and economic consolidation which will no doubt still have to survive very difficult times ahead , but which , in the long term , will be of great value to us .
To delay doing this might be counterproductive and may risk a return to the previous state of affairs .
We must not be afraid to raise the imprisonment of Wei Jinseng , the disappearance of the Panchen Lama , the situation in the Chinese orphanages , the death penalty , the continuing policy of moving ethnic Chinese to settle in Tibet and the dismal conditions of the Tibetan people in general .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , let me start by thanking Mr Hernández Mollar for his efforts towards reaching agreement on his report and the further amendments to the proposed directive that is under discussion today .
This initiative rests on the subsidiarity principle .
My view concerning Romania and Bulgaria – particularly Romania – is that membership of the European Union would be good for those children who find themselves abandoned or in care .
If pre @-@ flight inspections of aircraft are not technical inspections , then what are they ?
First we should realise that this is a challenge asking for a common coordinating answer , not a competition on who demonstrates first the most compassion .
in writing . - UKIP opposes any EU management of our industries , as it should be up to national elected governments to decide on the future and any potential subsidy of coal mines .
If we cooperate more closely in this area , we will be able to spend our money more usefully and achieve greater efficiency .
The uranium mines are often left in an unprotected condition and are a great danger to the surrounding environment .
If we consider the long @-@ term interests of the European Union , that is , to retain its attractiveness to both EU citizens and our immediate neighbours , whether it be Turkey or all the North African countries , I believe that we should bring back a more inclusive Europe within ourselves , naturally , with the proviso that this can by no means be unconditional , and that we must not save on the work that is expected from all candidate countries .
As I have already said , we want to wage an effective fight against fraud .
This is not only a matter of media actions and campaigns - no matter how important they are - it is also a matter of policies and concrete actions in order to defend the euro from the systemic attacks it has been under recently .
These are the topics I have attempted to add to the text of the report , so that a serious debate can be opened on the issues .
And that brings me to a problem in the area of internal affairs .
The manufacture and storage of pyrotechnic substances is covered by Council Directive 96 / 82 of 9 December 1996 on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances , the so @-@ called Seveso II directive .
A further complication is that the Treaty stipulates the total number of MEPs shall not exceed 751 .
I regret that I do not have sufficient time to comment to the Commissioner on the amendments we consider essential in order to fulfil these two objectives at least .
There are still huge inequalities in the development of several areas , while the prospects for the poorer Member States are unpropitious .
In contrast to the Council , Parliament has given specific figures in this regard .
And therefore we cannot live in fear and terror .
We need a common procedure and effective measures to protect refugees and to tackle the mafias who run the cruel traffic in those refugees .
Here we are referring to planning in order to achieve energy efficiency in precisely those energies which are the most consumed and the most polluting .
The Commission &apos;s proposal and report are in the main good .
As regards the United States , this leadership effect has , in my opinion , been very evident .
More and more scientists are going public to challenge climate orthodoxy .
I am therefore quite prepared to argue the case for them .
I hope that the Commission and the Council can reach agreement on their respective roles in exercising their right to initiatives and in carrying forward the legislative process itself . As I have told Parliament , the task before us is immense and ambitious , and the Commission needs to have the necessary human resources to respond to this challenge .
The rapporteur asked the Commission to submit the whole MED file to competent national judicial authorities by 1 December .
Are they quibbling about the total horror of this ?
One example of this is Hallandsåsen in Sweden , where the ground water was lowered according to the criteria determined for the building of a tunnel through the ridge .
The priority in the world today is security and the fight against terrorism .
. The regulation on the introduction of the euro has proved to be a sound legal framework during the change @-@ over period in the context of the adoption of the euro as a single currency in all current euro area countries .
I know that reform within the existing European institutions must take place .
I too could fill an evening &apos;s programme with slides on my experience of 27 years in developing countries , on the striking difference between the Union &apos;s , then the Community &apos;s , development cooperation and the bilateral interests of various European Member States .
The fact that others are doing so does not justify our doing the same .
I would very much welcome it if we in the European Parliament could agree on a single set of definitions for these arrangements .
Georgia could be the perfect model of transition to a democratic and free market system , full of protection for human rights and the operation of the rule of law .
My delegation has remained as we wish to submit a written explanation .
And we believe that in the days after peace , our partnership can only soar higher .
In order to encourage Member States to assume their full responsibility in promoting integrated coastal zone management , the Commission has introduced the proposed recommendation .
In other words , we are talking about digital democracy .
If you are interested in languages , theatre and the performing arts , what one also discovers is that , fundamentally , these areas make up our heritage .
( Renewed uproar in the NI and IND / DEM ranks )
Do you intend to settle it soon ?
But this must not be at the expense of other , equally important tasks .
The fact of the matter is that we have been , for 28 years , supporting tobacco growing within the Community and the financial dependency that goes with it .
In particular , was it right at that point in time ?
From that point of view , I think that if we have reduced red tape , we have made a constructive contribution to this subject , and can continue to do so .
But the President @-@ in @-@ Office also mentioned the harassment of journalists , and I would like to ask whether he knows how many legal actions there are against journalists , because freedom of expression is being grossly suppressed in Belarus .
Like the Council , we advocate better voluntary cooperation in Europe on product licensing .
I am also grateful to him for his lively speech .
&lt; empty &gt;
Also at Malpensa , a low @-@ cost airline , easyJet , had 15 534 slots in 2008 and on 24 March 2009 had 22 936 , a significant rise representing a 47 % increase in capacity .
Article 150 has therefore not been respected .
This is why we have put forward a proposal for a protocol on increased legal cooperation .
The agreements can be revoked at any time in the case of forced labour . The definition of forced labour in this connection was defined by the Geneva convention in 1925 and 1956 .
As far as women in advertising are concerned , I must nevertheless say that it is a great virtue of the women &apos;s movement that in the last few years sexy men have also appeared .
The PSE Group urges the Commissioner to encourage more actions like this and encourage the Member States themselves to take on board their own responsibilities to encourage modal shift in a much more dramatic and radical way than we have seen in the past .
I have given this reply in response to previous questions in this generally related area and that remains the position .
The Committee on Development is delighted by the Commission &apos;s pledge to ensure that the Millennium Development Goals are respected , especially with regard to education .
They are right but , in order to flourish , the entrepreneur needs favourable policy , low interest rates , a competitive euro and , above all , he needs to know the relationship between a given business activity and the number of job offers .
In spite of the progress made in terms of reform of the Treaties , many of us have for a long time been absolutely convinced that this House will only be considered as a proper Parliament when it is able , among other things , to make the European Commission fully accountable to it .
The US administration has also revealed an ambitious financial reform plan , which President Obama confirmed this week as a priority of his term of office .
I should like to thank the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council for the Finnish Council Presidency , and for the constructive cooperation there has been between the Presidency and Parliament .
I would like to emphasise the strong political message sent out by the European Council , reaffirming the importance that the Heads of State and Government of the Union attached to a fundamental project , together with various political guidelines and priorities which will turn this area into a reality , following a progressive strategy , within a time @-@ frame of five years , and that , above all , the three components of this area should be in balance : freedom , security and justice .
Europe created a Solidarity Fund for regions and states that have suffered natural disasters .
The constant increase in wine production and quality in the so @-@ called &apos; New World &apos; countries ( South Africa , Australia and South America , where vines are , by contrast , being planted ) , the increasing presence of these wines on the European market and the fact that worldwide demand for wine is on the increase make the idea of grubbing @-@ up all the more incomprehensible .
It is not in their interest at all , because if their ceiling is 108 % why should they make improvements when , with this number of trips they reach a ceiling that they cannot raise by reducing emissions , since they cannot travel more often without penalties being imposed on them ?
In these circumstances , and although I support the objective of the directive , I have decided to abstain on this text in the final vote .
The problem arises not in their travelling but in the way they are treated in the host country .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , first of all , I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work .
At no point in that film , which is almost two and a half hours long , is there any mention of the European Union , of our presence , of the Barcelona Process .
The fact that we are removing some of the obstacles to trade faced by the poor countries is obviously a good thing .
There are two such filling stations in France , for example , and one in Spain , while there are none at all in the new Member States that joined the European Union in 2004 and 2007 .
Nevertheless , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission proposal involves a budgetary increase of 26 % , which I think is highly significant .
This report itself is heading in a generous direction regarding asylum policy .
This is the whole point of the new Council regulation , which concedes our customs duties on bananas , sugar and rice for the 48 least developed countries .
We do not want more money .
This starts in school lessons , and we have to set the tone for it from primary level onwards .
You can therefore see , ladies and gentlemen , that we are not short of projects .
It is a non @-@ exhaustive list because of space .
We have to say more about what we in Europe will , together , be able to achieve once our structures have been revised , even in a globalised world .
in writing . - I supported the Klaß report , which deals with many important issues facing women in our rural areas .
Perhaps the timing was not right , maybe I should table this question again in June , so that he could outline even further what the Council should have done and account for its stewardship over a six @-@ month period .
There are no individual explanations and solutions : we must therefore find joint explanations and solutions .
We must not forget our political responsibility to history : the European Union has a responsibility as well as the Heads of the States of Israel and Palestine .
That is why the forthcoming summit must send out a clear signal to the citizens of Europe that it will improve the situation .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as happens unfortunately all too often in our assembly , the know @-@ alls have again struck by tabling in response to the situation in Kenya a motion which is almost a word for word copy of a text drafted by the International Monetary Fund dated last July , despite the fact that it is very difficulty to understand who was responsible for the violence in Kenya .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the Commission in its role as the EU &apos;s representative in the G20 , together with the Presidency , strongly advocates increased support to low @-@ income countries , particularly the poorest , as one of the critical priorities of the G20 commitments .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( NL ) I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Rack , for the good cooperation .
This is essential to ensure safety , particularly in emergencies .
The Commission &apos; s recommendation and report may be evaluated in the light of the euro system &apos; s most fundamental problems , and these are undeniably major and glaringly apparent .
&quot; As was recalled at the Lisbon and Stockholm European Councils , the integration of financial services markets is fundamental to strengthening the European economy .
I want the Commission to contact the Irish authorities to find out why it has taken a Member of Parliament to reveal the facts , despite the fact that we have a department responsible for investigating breaches of labour law .
Yet it does not provide any kind of response to the political issues and to some of the ethical issues which aroused the opposition of a majority of Members of this House on 27 October .
The importance of libraries in raising the education and living standards of western countries is enormous .
I repeat : first the hierarchy , so that jointly agreed rules can be applied in the best possible way .
Pursuant to Rule 141 ( 4 ) of the Rules of Procedure , Mr Helmer may put a question to Mr Farage .
Be bold enough to do it !
On 8 May , Europe celebrates victory over Nazism .
May I remind honourable Members that the PKK is included in the European Union ’ s list of terrorist organisations .
It will also be the year of a new start for the Community and the Member States in that field .
Is the Presidency aware that the Maltese Government is not allowing journalists , either local or international , to visit detention centres where immigrants are being held ?
No one , therefore , can remain indifferent .
I hope that the Commissioner for Social Affairs will act quickly to provide the information necessary to release 50 % at second reading .
A situation which must be prevented and which I would like to consider is that of the new type of work via the Internet , teleworking , part @-@ time work , which can be an easy breeding @-@ ground for undeclared work .
Leave to Member States what is theirs , for heaven &apos;s sake .
We are hesitating and starting a shameful period of horse @-@ trading .
It is a cause of anguish to me that there are two things that have not been achieved .
This crisis requires swift and effective action from the EU and its Member States .
We have now seen something similar happen in connection with the Commission &apos;s use of Article 171 as regards the provision on fines .
Although in its report the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment does support the Commission &apos;s proposal to set a limit value only for benzene as the first substance , it makes a strong recommendation for the Commission to draw up a proposal as to how the required limit value could be set as soon as possible for all substances classified as carcinogens .
I would like to thank President Santer , despite all the difficulties we have had , for what he has done in the past couple of years .
My second comment relates , in particular , to that part of Mrs Napoletano &apos;s report where she says that we should support Agenda 21 and consider introducing a new budget line .
I will illustrate this with migration policy .
The aim of this , with the principle of subsidiarity in mind , is to reduce the fishing effort .

The purpose of the second group of amendments , comprising Nos 8 and 18 , is to maintain the special aid for hazelnuts through to the end of 2002 .
A new agreement needs to be reached concerning how this can work in a genuinely acceptable way .
I feel that the final text is well balanced and is a real improvement on the current Directive .
EUR 60 million is committed , of which 40 million is grants and 20 million is loans .

Firstly , the consultation procedure : we fought to have the procedure extended and supported and to have it include , alongside institutional and administrative topics , new topics that are of importance on the ground : I am referring to non @-@ governmental organisations and to civil society .
Will they get their goods ?
It is my belief that the demands should only be refused on the basis of objective criteria alone and that , if access is refused , the injured party should be able to submit the case to the National Regulatory Authority .

( EL ) Mr President , &apos; Europe &apos; , &apos; peace &apos; , &apos; human rights &apos; , &apos; Palestine &apos; , &apos; Gaza &apos; : a vocabulary that we use which is rich in words .
In fact , the reforms are necessary and urgent , as the resolution of Parliament ordains .
This situation , which shows in passing how much the European institutions disregard the letter of texts when they want to , would by itself justify rejecting the budget on principle .
The ACP countries will , however , only have a sufficiently strong agriculture if it is adequately protected as a budding industry as it gets off the ground .
Unfortunately , these opportunities were considered to violate competition rules .
The blind will be able to &apos; feel &apos; what they have in their hands .
On Wednesday morning , a debate will take place on Africa , on the challenges of globalisation and also , of course , on this campaign against poverty , in which Jack Straw , Hilary Benn and Louis Michel will participate .
In fact , our experience , acquired through visits to different parts of the world , highlights four worrying issues :
Thank you for the question , in response to which I can state that the Commission has absolutely no plans to harmonise direct company taxation .
In addition , the EU can help to build democratic institutions and a working state based on the rule of law which respects human rights and genuine freedom of speech and of the press .

Mr President , many citizens and Members of Parliament believe in the existence of European culture .
Finally , I would like to urge the Commission not to let this process drag on .
Parliament has a duty to draw the attention of the Commission and the Council to the need to closely link the aim of economic and social cohesion to that of cohesion in the European area , which is clearly expressed in the Varela report .
. ( DE ) Madam President , I would like to make a similar announcement to this House .
Statistics , I agree , are very important for assessing problems : 45 000 deaths a year is certainly an impressive figure , as is 45 000 million lire spent by the community .
Madam President , my group does not share the optimism with regard to the impact and benefits of gene technology .
We must also proceed with caution , and I am in full agreement with what the Commission said with regard to the Council , that we should not exacerbate nationalist feelings in China at a time when it is playing host to a very important event for the whole country , a country which is seeking to achieve its integration into the international arena .
Mr President , yesterday evening we saw on the news pictures of the memorial service for those killed in the accident involving a military aircraft at Eindhoven airport at the beginning of the week .
I personally think that this comparison is rather far @-@ fetched , but it is useful to remind ourselves of the discrepancies .
- ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , at this session we are doing something described in our country as drawing up the bill in the absence of the innkeeper .
If Europe wants to become the most competitive knowledge @-@ based continent , it cannot succeed in this without well @-@ educated people who undergo lifelong learning .
Finally , allow me to make one further comment which I already made last year in my report .
It is no secret that China refuses to engage in direct dialogue with the democratically elected government of Taiwan .
This must be made clear and there should be no attempt to cloud an issue which is crucial to the economy and agriculture of the Azores .
I believe this plan to ban cluster munitions globally to be a matter , as I was saying , that goes to the heart of civilisation and humanity .
Each country has its own peculiarities , so each country needs to have its own plan , but we have a Community plan .
Ultimately , what is at stake is basically the use of taxpayers ’ money .
The rapporteur has really shown great commitment to the work on reforming this regulation and I congratulate her on this .
I do not want this to be a coup d &apos;état .
The report , which was published in the American periodical &apos; National Catholic Reporter &apos; , talks of rape , sexual abuse , contamination with AIDS , forced abortions and blackmail and persecution of anyone who has the courage to report these acts of violence to the officials in charge .
Let us take this opportunity to examine seriously the possibility that perhaps in the end our enthusiasm for bioethanol will evaporate , and maybe many of the factories producing it will not be viable .
For next year , I am pleased to be able to note the inclusion in the Programme of a number of initiatives highlighted as of particular interest to the European Parliament .
Therefore , we are pleased to welcome it .
You still have the chance to decide for the common future of a greater Europe without losing face .
We shall now go and sign the legislative package .
Previously , I suggested that Parliament and the Commission should send a special observation mission to Egypt , and now we should grant this delegation the power to make decisions .

Next steps in border management in the EU (
A balanced compromise has been struck with the Council and it is this compromise that will , if all goes well , be adopted tomorrow , for which many thanks .

As you know , there is a severe drought in my country at the moment , which is especially acute in the regions of the south of the country .
in writing . - ( PL ) I would like to express my thanks to Mr Marcin Libicki , Chairman of the European Parliament &apos;s Committee on Petitions , for working on a subject that has aroused a great deal of anxiety .
The fact remains that the subject covered by Mr Kouchner &apos;s report is an important one .
Today ( 2007 @-@ 2013 ) , the European Social Fund also has a vital role to play by helping business and workers adapt to the new market conditions and supporting workplace innovations , lifelong learning and increased mobility .
I should also like to thank the President of the European Parliament , Mr Gil @-@ Robles , for taking my initiatives to eliminate crime in and around the European institutions very seriously ; our group chairman Mr Martens for promising not to forget this issue in future in Belgium and to continue to support us ; the President @-@ in @-@ Office for promising to devote his efforts to this ; and finally the Quaestors and the Conference of Presidents , for whom this issue has now become genuinely topical .
Commissioner Bolkestein would have us believe that it only concerns journalists if they recommend shares .
Alternative sources of energy and new technologies will reduce our dependency on importing raw materials and energy .
Many Belarussians support eventual EU membership for their country , although if asked they also claim to support union with Russia .
We appreciate the fact that social aspects of the cooperation have been highlighted and that the problems with growth are emphasised .
It cannot be a surprise to anyone that the college of Commissioners presented to us only serves to exacerbate all of these reservations .
Elections by universal suffrage made it possible to elect the National People &apos;s Assembly , marked by a multi @-@ party system and freedom of debate .
The vote will take place at the end of the debate .
That is not quite true .
Here , we have the beginnings of a compromise .
Everyone is free to interpret the word &apos; vision &apos; as they choose .
( The President cut off the speaker )
Mr President , my Group disagrees with this voting arrangement .
The Europe 2020 strategy is showing us which ways to go .
Let us not forget that these parties are the cornerstone of European democracy and there must be no doubts as to whether they are being funded in the correct manner .
And it is not only a one @-@ way street , everyone involved is included .
We should move towards UN summits that address specific goals , the prime example being Kyoto .
As the Commissioner has said , China is now Africa &apos;s third most important trading partner .
The situation is not easy because we are in a period of transition that is both delicate and complex , but a larger and stronger Union is within our reach .
It should not just rely on the written roadmap ; it should visit the region as a joint body .
The Community patent and the initiatives to improve the European patent , that is , the London Agreement on translations and the EPLA , are not mutually exclusive .
Any form of control of incoming patients would have to be assessed as to whether it would amount to an acceptable exception to the principle of non @-@ discrimination on the basis of nationality set out in the EU Treaty .
Mr President , Mrs Sierra González has tackled a variety of complex issues in her report .
I should also point out that , if only because more and more regions and sectors are suffering from a lack of trained and skilled labour , the question of employability must be addressed far more forcefully than hitherto .
It also depends on full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia .
But , in doing this , it is very important that we have a careful look at the burden @-@ sharing .

The Progress Community programme is a very important tool for achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy in the field of employment and social policy .
Half jokingly , half seriously , I would like to ask you : would not it be worthwhile to recommend that unpopular governments refrain from , let us say , active promotion of the idea of a united Europe ?
Various measurements taken at national level have shown that , in climatic conditions such as high luminosity and a stable atmosphere , reducing the precursor agents does not produce the desired effect of reducing the concentration of ozone .
It will give the estimated 20 million people who are legally long @-@ term residents in the European Union the legal framework of rights and obligations that will help to integrate them .
Thirdly , the development of content here in Europe is also slow .
I also have been making efforts for well over a year to try and get some semblance of order into the idea of colleges of supervisors or a better regulatory system for cross @-@ border financial institutions .
Yesterday I read an interview with a sociologist who said he rejected the idea of European integration based on smoothing out identities , on the same beer from Hamburg to Palermo or wine that tastes the same from Greece to Brittany .
I prefer to speak of violence in the family rather than violence against women , as , regrettably , we women can also be violent , and studies show that women are sometimes even more violent than men , and that when they start to become violent there is no limit to what they might do .
What lies behind it ?
This means that Turkey is costing us as much as the ten countries that acceded to this Union this year .
By chance that was precisely the day on which voting on the so @-@ called Gaulider case was due in the Slovakian parliament .
So I would like clarification on that point , please .
Unfortunately , the debate so far has centred on cabin baggage and flight time limitations for flight crew .
The programme implements this demand , which is why there is no need for pseudo @-@ humanitarian bombast about improving national systems , combating discrimination and so on . The negative experience from the application of similar measures to higher education shows that the integrated programme is here to ram through all levels of education in every Member State .
This made it clear , in the remarks column , that one organisation , any single organisation within that spending line should not get more than 65 % .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , a few weeks ago a young man by the name of Carlos Palomino lay dying of stab wounds in the Madrid metro following a clash with right @-@ wing extremists .
Emigration from one country to another because of unemployment or poor working conditions in one &apos;s country of origin is not a social need .
As politicians we owe it to our communities , to all communities , to future communities , to stand up and be counted .
What we are asking for here is that the Commission examine the risks in the longer term and that it makes clear in its rules how those risks should be hedged .

New jobs , not directly connected to agriculture , need to be created in rural areas if we are not to suffer rural unemployment , depopulation and villages reduced to dormitories for towns and cities , with all the attendant transport and environmental problems that entails .
We wish to see biotechnology as an opportunity that will open up new dimensions in science .
I believe that is a task which benefits both sides .
The current Commission proposal makes these necessary and logical changes and was unanimously approved by the Committee on Fisheries .
For my part , Mr President , I thank you for giving me the floor , and for your attention .
To conclude , allow me to say one thing : we must be very clear with both sides and make them fully aware that our principles are our principles .
And now , ahead of the presidential elections scheduled for 27 July , new conflicts are erupting .
We have of course payments coming in which clearly come from various countries .
However , it is also a focal point for paedophiles , con artists and the most unsophisticated foreign agents .
It will inevitably require action using a number of approaches : job and retirement flexibility , a humanist and realistic immigration policy , and clear complementarities between the pay @-@ as @-@ you @-@ go and capital @-@ funded financing systems , the reason why the MR delegation voted against paragraph 99 on this last matter .
( Applause ) Finally I would like to deal with the points that were made on Agenda 2000 as well as several of the other specific issues .
I believe that this scoreboard is important in terms of giving us a general and complete overview , and I therefore believe it should be a flexible and adaptable instrument so that it can be modified and adapted to varying requirements and situations , clearly guaranteeing a framework of legal certainty .
It may well be necessary to sort this out at political level .
It is for these reasons that I have voted against this draft budget .
However , we cannot support the report , because it calls for the control of fraud , corruption and financial irregularities to be dealt with through the establishment of a European criminal justice area and the setting @-@ up of a public prosecution authority for the EU .
I am referring here to our three main work sites .
One example : the assessment by the Commission already stated that tens of thousands of asylum seekers go into hiding because of the Dublin system , and yet the rapporteur argues against detention .
Certainly , as someone pointed out , money provides the backbone for this effort .
The tragic situation in Japan highlights to us once again that we need to do our utmost to create rapid response mechanisms for tackling disasters .
We should bear in mind , however , that if this debate had taken place on Wednesday of last week , it would have been quite different .
Social partners at all levels will also be encouraged to help define and implement the flexicurity measures and also to use the common principles as a reference .
This is an essential requirement if we are to be able , in future , to develop real policies of growth and solidarity and policies for the future in the context of an enlarged Union that wishes to succeed for the benefit of all its citizens .
It is important that the resolution shows which measures should be taken to accelerate accession talks , so that the technical details can be completed in 2010 .
Our resolution calls on the Council and the Commission to renew pressure on the Nigerian authorities , but unfortunately not all Member States have been wholehearted in their support for previous sanctions .
Banks are collapsing , or are being propped up with billions from national budgets ; the market is collapsing , and millions of people are afraid for their jobs and their future .
Welcome , Mr Rodríguez Zapatero .
Another key issue is Amendment 4 , to which many other speakers have referred .
We have examples of this in the Netherlands , in the shape of the committee that monitors the environmental impact reports .
And , since the Intergovernmental Conference is producing no genuine progress in this area , I fear that such reports are going to take the same form in the future .
And thank you for reminding us of these great celebrations of Schengen .
Overcoming the marginalisation of Roma communities by fully recognising their fundamental rights to healthcare , education and the protection of vulnerable groups is absolutely incumbent upon us .
We abstained from the vote on the compromise arising from an agreement between the two largest groups in Parliament - the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in Parliament - because we feel that it does not meet the legitimate rights and concerns of the consumers and of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises as regards protecting workers and the environment .
I support , therefore , acceleration of negotiations concerning the free trade zone , and the broadest possible participation of Ukraine in Union programmes .
It has taken a long time , but we can say that we have at last reached an important milestone .
I hope that the European Council &apos;s conclusions will be an accurate reflection of the debates that have taken place to date on the 2050 objectives , and that they will not be published before the debate on these objectives , which is due to take place in March 2011 .
So I call on the Commission to reconsider whether their plans for the development of the Elbe and also of the Danube are still justified in the light of current experience .
Are there any ideas or not regarding the proposed referendum ?
No society - including European society - can afford not to take advantage of the contributions elderly people can make in terms of their experience , training and knowledge .
I am , however , resolutely opposed to the calls for health warnings .
. ( FR ) Europe is now , once again , demonstrating its mastery of the art of the paradox .
Article 10 is another important article .
We decided no later than today in the Commission to establish this fight against illegal content .
In memory of the almost one million victims , and to express our hope that we never again see a tragedy of this nature , I would ask you to observe a minute ’ s silence .
( Applause )
The third and last point is that of course we need to have an unbiased , open and serious discussion about an active immigration policy .
Mrs Panayotopoulos @-@ Cassiotou , I do believe that it is in everyone &apos;s interests , particularly of the travellers themselves , that they should be able to fly with the maximum of safety .
However strong your arguments are , I cannot reject the oral amendment if plenary does not oppose it , and I cannot see any other Members standing up .
In light of the succession of food crises and of factors in food contamination , such as the presence of dioxins , regulatory frameworks must be created to enhance food safety , of which the hygiene of food for human consumption is an essential component .

Reducing the deadlines both for collecting information and exchanging it between the Member States &apos; tax authorities can help to improve monitoring of transactions of this type .
Lisbon missed its big chance to really improve things substantially for the citizens of Europe .
We are talking about a period of years .
We want to put an end to discrimination and we hope that a sense of European citizenship can be developed . We also feel that issues such as the free movement of persons , visas and immigration - and I am not going to go back over the events that are taking place at the moment - all need to be resolved as soon as possible if we want to make any progress on the objective set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam .
We must , above all , assess the quality of public spending .
The Commission is of the opinion that a horizontal approach is the most efficient way to guarantee a comprehensive responsibility regime for environmental damage .
They are also very concerned about the pressure they are under to buy expensive toys for their children . They are angry at the increasing monopolization of well @-@ loved sporting fixtures which they can no longer view without a significant investment for each event .
That is why it is so important that we and the European Union clear the way for the construction and establishment of demonstration projects , because a whole new industry , a transitional technology for storing CO2 can be developed without minimising major efforts elsewhere .
At the same time , that would promote sustainable economic growth , sustainable human development and respect for indigenous and local peoples .
Can we do otherwise ?
I would have hoped that there would be global recognition at this stage that the CCCTB proposal is badly thought out and ill @-@ advised .
Malaysia
The Commission is therefore doing well to repudiate all these lovely fairy @-@ tales of the past and to work on that 3 % of immigration that can still be useful , where there can be good grounds for people to enter the EU .
Supporting a changeover to production of fair trade bananas is an excellent way of helping smaller producers to become competitive in the face of dollar bananas .
This was previously announced - on 9 July - by President Prodi .

I know that intensive discussions are taking place on this question .
Authorisation has been granted for installations of equipment to coexist side by side for common use , but that is all .
The second point is on the amendments from the Agriculture Committee which have been taken up to a large extent by Parliament and the Council of Ministers .
We call upon the Commission to explain to us whether and how that plan is compatible with its much @-@ vaunted legislation on competition .
That is entirely possible , and I believe that we must be prepared for that eventuality too .
Firstly , the conditions which need to be met are , of course , clear .
I also wish Commissioner Hübner every success in that campaign , as I see that you , too , are going to the voters in the coming months .
Among the greatest beneficiaries of the Italian arms trade is Saudi Arabia , which is certainly not an example of a country that is respectful of rights .
On average , carmakers invest 4 % in research and development .
I am glad that the Council , the Commission and in particular Parliament all accept this challenge .
It is highly complicated to find the money for this in time .

What we are talking about is a global network .
The South African offer is based on a 12 year transitional period .
If the Union were to make the Commission its sole negotiator , it would be likely to increase the scale of this disadvantage , and would be encouraging the kind of obscurity in negotiation from which we suffered so severely at Blair House .

Let me come back to the BSE monitoring committee .
The lists are well known ; they are published , as are the measures they lead to .

I believe that the mandatory collection of data by type of goods with a view to collating maritime transport statistics is vital in order to promote co @-@ modality and the possibility of combining different modes of transport .
Technical arguments do not exist .
This subject has occupied a lot of European Parliament time .
( FR ) Mr President , the creation of the European political parties was a major step forward towards a more democratic Europe capable of expressing the wishes of its citizens .

Support for the joint resolution from the Green group and GUE / NGL would be able to avoid all this .
As the Gahler report states , &apos; the challenges facing the Arctic are global and should therefore include all relevant actors &apos; .
Our committee does not have the competence or the authority to do so .
We , too , are opposed to export subsidies for the transport of live animals for slaughter , but this indiscriminate amendment , which did not distinguish between cattle for breeding or production and animals for slaughter , was lamentably inappropriate .
Making politics out of the fatalities of ...
Nevertheless , the treaties do not , apart from anything else , confer competence on the European Community with regard to issues of defence and national security , which means that the use of airspace for military purposes does not fall within the competence of the European Community , as we advocated during the debate on the Single Sky .
What has been achieved to date is only an interim or transitional agreement , meaning that we agree to suspend the WTO panel and not , as has been alleged , to remove it in exchange for promises from the United States .
The Commissioner herself has put a lot of energy into the region , but I am also aware that the Presidency is of the opinion that the European Union must not leave this region to the Chinese or the Russians .
Or is it something we do not want , because we want to retain the differentiation between nations ?
The resolution is so neoliberal that it prompted the Social Democrats to try and whitewash their connivance with its contents , through the presentation of a series of amendments aiming to tone it down - so @-@ called capitalism with a human face .
Mr President , could you please explain why in the last part @-@ session a simple majority was sufficient to amend the annexes , whereas today an absolute majority is needed to amend an annex ?
Mr President , I am encouraged by the Commissioner &apos;s fresh approach to this topic .
I therefore reiterate this House &apos;s call to prioritise the modernisation of public procurement rules in such a way as to avoid its fragmentation and to encourage companies to choose this option .
Let me explain the importance of granting cross @-@ border loss relief for the internal market .
I have had plenty of conversations on this subject with many of the people involved and also with NGOs , and I also know what it is like for the children .
Today , the Commission has also , at the same time , decided on the adjustment of the Financial Perspective in 2004 prices , so this results in a difference .
Having consistently criticised the United States for its one @-@ sided approach which meant that it was exacerbating the situation by becoming part of the problem instead of part of the solution , I regret that the PPE @-@ DE Group is putting itself in a similar position .

Reinforcing the Union &apos;s disaster response capacity ( debate )
In 2006 the Agricultural Commission of the European Parliament included in its programme a session in Poland , enabling MEPs to see for themselves the hardships that their Polish colleagues had been talking about .

I hope that , as soon as the new Commission takes up its duties , negotiations will get underway between our two institutions aimed at introducing the necessary changes to the framework agreement .
Thirdly , given the quarter to half a million Taiwanese immigrants in Shanghai alone who regularly travel between China and Taiwan , it is hard to imagine that the Chinese would take any risks of them bringing in diseases from Taiwan .
What , I wonder , is the sense of this new investment drive in a sector which , despite receiving decades of public investment - far exceeding the volume staked in all the other sectors - is once again producing this kind of mess .
What was , essentially , the same draft treaty had already been rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands .
Such cooperation already exists and I am sure that the EU will not try to take over or interfere with this work .
The report correctly notes the need for bodies at EU , national and regional levels to cooperate in matters of coastal management , and I consider that , within this context , coastal areas and nations must take the lead role , with the EU acting as a facilitator .
Economic cooperation - investments by SMEs spring to mind , but also political dialogue and exchanges - the Minister has quoted the entire list - are of major importance .
The content will be discussed in closer detail over the coming months among the countries concerned , the relevant stakeholders , the Commission services and other EU institutions .

Access to adequate treatment for the citizens of Europe is very lopsided .
Mr Clegg , the Commission acknowledges that the agreement on China &apos; s accession to the WTO is an extremely important decision .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
When , as in this case , fiscal sovereignty is at stake , consultation and consensus - from my point of view - should prevail .
I believe that is a very important question .
Very often these companies are European .
I am delighted that we are now well on the way to reconciling REACH ’ s two priorities , namely consumer protection and industrial policy , since this will ensure that the legislation is genuinely forward @-@ looking and groundbreaking .

Two of my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries , Mrs Fraga Estévez and Mr Romeva i Rueda , were in Marrakesh and will be talking about this during the debate .
The Union ’ s Member States will not get back on track to achieve healthy growth by now limiting their spending on investment and by cutting European citizens ’ purchasing power .

Having weighed everything up , we will endorse the package , because we know that in 11 years &apos; time , we will have drastically renewed chemical substances policy and will have made it transparent .

This is the third reform of the wine sector in 12 years , and I am glad that a Commission Communication has now made it possible to reconcile the very different positions and objectives .
A committee which has already examined a great many of these amendments and rejected them .
I wish to emphasise that this agenda is realistic within the options that can be influenced by the European Commission .
It may all be working from a macro @-@ economic point of view , but in micro @-@ economic terms there is a real problem , as businesses in frontier areas are constantly pointing out .

Unfortunately , this report mentions these violations again in Paragraph 8 .
I believe we have really made remarkable progress on the energy dossier during this legislation and , most importantly , it is supported by our citizens and by industry .
Estimates indicate that the world &apos;s population will grow to 9 billion people , while at the same time we find ourselves confronted with the effects of climate change , such as water shortages and drought .
A lasting basis for human rights is made up of the ideals of democracy and freedom , as well as social and economic justice .
His legacy to Britain will be not only to leave us bankrupt but also to deny the British people a vote on this latest transfer of power from Westminster to Brussels .
Let us turn our attention to this , to the time bomb of the multicultural society that puts the basic achievements of our society at risk .
On 22 March , the Commission will be making , in writing , a complaint against the USA to the World Trade Organisation , which will serve as a protest against the American state &apos;s open @-@ ended subsidy of Boeing , which amounts to numberless billions .
There have recently been intensive and generally positive developments in the region .
I had thought that Mrs Alfano was going to carry on in a similar vein to Mrs Jäätteenmäki , but in fact , that report should not have had any explanations of vote .
The next item is the report ( A4 @-@ 0171 / 96 ) by Mr Kittelmann , on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations , on the proposal for a Council Decision concerning the conclusion on behalf of the European Community , as regards matters within its competence , of the results of the WTO negotiations on financial services and movement of natural persons ( COM ( 96 ) 0154 - C4 @-@ 0272 / 96 @-@ 96 / 0105 ( CNS ) ) .
Sugar producers in certain developing countries too will be affected by the reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar .
I would like the political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina to understand the following : the Stabilisation and Association Agreement provides a solid foundation and a lever for a profound commitment from this country .
It gets more identity .
Therefore we need to press on and to insist on further deregulation and to give advice as to how that could be done .
It is worth stressing that the entire European Union &apos;s share of the global shipbuilding industry is three times smaller than that of South Korea alone , which subsidises its shipbuilding industry .
I believe we must observe the Rules of Procedure , even if not a single group has objected to the agenda .
Only 10 % of the 61,000 temporary agency workers in my own region say that they are temporary agency workers by choice .
Now we have new arguments .
B5 @-@ 0348 / 2002 , by Mr van den Bos and others , on behalf of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , on the human rights situation in Equatorial Guinea ;
Mrs Izquierdo , you are only entitled to ask one supplementary question , and you have already done that .
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could give us his frank appraisal of the Ergenekon affair .
I call on the Commission to create instruments to combat price volatility and excessive speculation , which in turn help exacerbate the global food crisis .
Parliament &apos;s first reading took place during the previous parliamentary term .
At the end of the debate on the Watson report , Mr Vitorino said that the amendment relating to the habeas corpus order would risk confusing the issue and undermine respect for human rights .
In Europe , particularly in the countries with the lowest birth rate ( Spain and Italy , amongst others ) , immigration is a necessary remedy .
In that respect , Amendment No 6 - on free and direct access by Member States to information held by another state - seems important to us because it will speed up the work of prosecuting this type of crime .
They upset the essential balance between the interests of consumers and the obligations and constraints which are a burden on producers .
The fact that our approach to organized crime and cross @-@ border cooperation on police and judicial affairs is still not really off the ground is a serious matter , and actually defies belief when you think how the Mafia is gaining ground in Central and Eastern Europe .
We said , &apos; regardless of the unfortunate events leading to the ruling , this legal decision by the Constitutional Court should now be respected by all parties , because the respect of state institutions is essential to ensure political stability &apos; .
The ceiling for them is determined by a policy of agricultural expenditure .
Unemployment is a big shock to everyone .
The Collins report rightly highlights the progress achieved in terms of indicators measuring the impact on the various sectors of the economy , though there may still be some structural problems in certain regions , as Mr Gallagher has pointed out .
All forms of discrimination are on the increase . It is important to stress that negative phenomena are on the increase particularly in the social sphere , and they cannot be ignored here , despite what some sectors of this House claim .
This would be possible subject to certain constraints , although not all Member States would accept it , and there is room for improvement here too .
It is not up to us to tell that country what type of government to vote in ; naturally we hope to see a victory for parties which desire peace or can put together a grand coalition that is not influenced by extremist groups .
We are a country of rapidly developing advanced technologies .
This has a very negative effect on the economy of future fisheries and on the health of marine ecosystems .
Political support must now be translated into concrete actions which create a more innovative climate in Europe .
This possibility is giving more people a voice in shaping our future .
I am speaking today not only as the Chair of the Intergroup on Poverty and Human Rights , but with a mandate from the majority of the intergroups in this House , and therefore from the Members of this House who are part of those intergroups .
I would also like to thank the Minister for his untiring efforts to reach an agreement .
I do not believe that is the same .
I consider the practice to be discriminatory against these women and girls .
In the vast majority of cases there is national competition between countries to meet air transport demand .
For example , what action do you propose to ensure that we build a greater rapprochement with Russia , instead of allowing Russia to drift further towards cooperation with rogue regimes , such as those of Iran and North Korea ?
But we would much prefer an agreement between the parties concerned , and we will continue to work towards this .
I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner to try also to include this dimension of the effects of competition in future competition reports .
The single currency offers a splendid environment for the promotion of employment .
This can be done by creating cross @-@ border corridors , by bringing about increased cooperation between infrastructural managers and better mutual coordination of investments between Member States and by making better priority arrangements in the case of delays .
Also , employees in nuclear plants and the public should be more closely involved in this field .
We hope that this measure will help Europe &apos;s citizens to make energy savings , so that they both end up with more money in their pocket and help the situation with global warming .
We in Europe are just not sufficiently aware of the fact that there are currently 16 wars going on in Africa .
I therefore believe that the proposal for a ban should be widened to include gill nets and also to include the 200 @-@ mile zones , because this proposal is based on maintaining what existed until very recently .
The Treaties offer many possibilities , but as always we need to clearly define the objective and means , bearing in mind the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality .
My consideration here is the ageing of installations and its consequences , in particular for security .
I therefore think that humans also fail to understand horses when they are scared , or when they try to defend themselves .
This situation was aggravated last summer when a decision was taken in the light of the report of the Committee of Independent Experts to end the contract with the technical assistance office which helped in the implementation of this programme .
The sector should therefore receive more aid .
The amendment proposes that the obligation set out in the Seveso II Directive should be restricted and only cover mining operations concerned with ore processing , i.e. metal extraction .
As in other eras of our history , it is essential that we reaffirm our democratic values in order to destroy the totalitarian course which terrorism takes us along .
Mr President , the fact that the different groups in this Parliament are tabling a motion for a resolution , in this ever controversial debate , which is the result of a broad consensus , seems to me to demonstrate the clear political will to decisively support open peace processes .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
Mr President , on behalf of my group , I would also like to thank my colleague , Mrs Corbey , for a well prepared report .
This type of farming is not very cost @-@ effective , however .
Thank you , Mr Verheugen , for that very encouraging answer .
That is what is before the Council and it is hoped that we can take a decision on this on 17 December .
We are well aware that the situation in Turkish prisons means we cannot ignore the violence and intransigence of certain prisoners and the fact that , in some cases , the Turkish authorities had lost control of whole sections of the prisons , as well as the constant reports from various authoritative sources of summary executions of prisoners who have tried to detach themselves from the organisations they belong to , and lots being drawn to select which prisoners are to fast until death .
So we do not see eye to eye on how we view certain targets .
As we do not have any information , we cannot make a response .
I feel that there is also a lack of leadership on this question .
. As draftsman for the report from the International Trade Committee on this report on external actions for financial , economic and technical assistance to third countries recovering from crisis I was concerned that this Stability Instrument should provide genuine added value , delivering an effective , immediate and integrated response .
The emphasis on maintaining the EU &apos;s territorial integrity and an economic security clause designed to secure the EU &apos;s communications and supplies implies a defence capability for the European Union .
The debate is closed .
By the end of the day we will have a better presidency thanks to those who drafted the &quot; fair chair platform &quot; and created the first real electoral battle in our history .
We will spend the next five years turning our vision into reality : making Europe a resource @-@ efficient , inclusive , social market economy - reflecting what makes us special , the European way of life .
On the other hand , with regard to point d of Amendment No 10 , which refers to the first directive , you suggest that , for reasons of public security or public order regulations , a Member State may reject the validity of the card .
Furthermore , we must insist that international law and UN resolutions are respected , denounce and condemn Morocco &apos;s brutal repression in the occupied territories against Sahrawi patriots who are resisting colonisation and fighting for their people &apos;s legitimate right to self @-@ determination , denounce the real humanitarian drama being imposed on the Sahrawi people who are obliged to live outside their country in refugee camps and we must call for urgent and appropriate international humanitarian aid .
We must attach much more importance to the protection of workers than is implied by this type of short @-@ term , expedient reasoning .
The issue of ODA has already been reasonably successfully treated in the Monterrey Conference , and the EU remains committed both to the Monterrey Consensus and the clear commitments on increased ODA that were decided in Barcelona and presented in Monterrey , and which the Danish Minister has just gone through in greater detail .
The Kazakhstan government assured the Commission that , despite the agreement , Kazakhstan considered itself to be free to determine for itself the content and conditions of its relations with third countries .
But I share the concerns highlighted in your third question regarding the importance of not undermining the existing Community acquis .
Unlike the common monetary policy , economic policy is not set at Community level , and so economic policy decisions remain in the hands of the national governments and parliaments .
Once you consider the directive to be necessary , you must stick with the directive .
As the report by Mr Tannock indicates – and I thank him warmly for his work – I believe that specific neighbourhood policies must be differentiated essentially according to the neighbouring country in question .
Indeed , the scope would then be greatly limited and it would mean that access to the networks for realistic prices for newcomers would be threatened .
I think there is an important difference , apart from our extreme fondness for severe self @-@ criticism .
You know that we have set up revolving apprenticeships , another very interesting system of education and training : you do your apprenticeship in another Union Member State and you are paid a small amount and , of course , you have to pay tax in the country where you are doing your apprenticeship .
It is this management that will , I think , be the main problem in the future .
Nor are there any warning messages here about magnets .
We will continue to deliver on our mandate .
In this way , we can avoid a scenario where mutual competition is so unfair that the wide and varied supply would diminish and that the easy access to information would be lost .
But , eight years on , children are not only still unprotected , but some are kidnapped , raped and murdered , and others are sold like common sexual goods for the use and enjoyment of unscrupulous and amoral customers .
However , I cannot understand why it is not possible to negotiate with Turkey over the &apos; Energy &apos; chapter , for example , which is vitally important , both for the EU and Turkey .
The European Parliament has also given its views on a number of task forces .
All the while , outside the European Union , several of its Member States , among the most powerful of them , are supporting , arming and financing vile dictatorships , especially in their former colonial empire .
We should at least want respect , for example , for similar standards to those which are , for us , a kind of moral , ethical and political beacon .
Parliament must therefore continue to foster the creation of cooperation mechanisms in scientific and technological innovation .
The debate is closed .
Therefore , as has been said , we need to be prepared for this by enhancing civil protection .
Implementing these decisions will require a great deal of hard work .
Thirdly , there is the problem of geographic origin , which everyone is talking about and in relation to which , unfortunately , the Scientific Committee has not drawn up any precise criteria .
I remind you what action the Commission has taken to address the failure of Greece to correctly transpose and apply Community waste legislation .
The Committee on Budgets therefore suggests that the present proposal with the amounts quoted could be considered as an experiment , a very commendable experiment at that .
I have received six motions for resolution ( 1 ) tabled in accordance with Rule 103 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
Europol &apos;s figures , cited in the question , show that there has been no improvement in this field .
But the time has come to set up a real Baltic Sea programme , in which we coordinate things in an entirely different way .
It is unacceptable that , despite the declarations and the vague desire for sanctions , nothing has ended up being done .
Otherwise , as a famous poet from my own city of Sligo , W.B. Yeats , once wrote : &apos; The centre cannot hold &apos; .
This &apos; governance and partnership &apos; resolution , which I supported , calls for stronger political leadership , an improvement in the implementation of legislation relating to the Single Market , and the introduction of tools for good governance ( reducing the transposition deficit , alleviating administrative burdens , partnership with local authorities , stronger involvement of national Parliaments , dialogue with civil society , and so on ) .
Insurance matters are incredibly sensitive issues .
For example , many fingers are being pointed at cargo flights .
Particular attention will be paid to the countries or projects we have supported , such as the one I have just mentioned .
It is also a sad fact , Mr President , that I am the first Member from a new Member State to speak on this item .
As you know , we have changed the timetable in order to get it included in the Vienna Summit .
Mr Kuhne mentioned the European Security Strategy .
It opens up real prospects in the medical and agricultural fields .
Just five months later , I have the pleasure of referring to the positive developments which ensued .
Weapons were laid down and all hostilities ceased while the Games were on .
How does the Commission intend to respond , to show solidarity with the conflict that is devastating the country ?
For this to happen , however , it is Fidel Castro and his regime that needs to change , and urgently .
It would be advisable to include technical experts in the Commission &apos;s standing committee .
Secondly , tax havens , which continue to exist and lead to losses of revenue equivalent to USD 800 billion every year according to the report .
Perhaps the European Commission will take them into consideration .
– Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , you spoke for six minutes , but you spoke in very general , very &apos; round &apos; terms .
So , under the authority of the Committee on Budgetary Control and its chairman , Mrs Theato - whom I would like to congratulate -a genuine power of Parliament has progressively built up , and Parliament , through discharge , is , therefore , well and truly expressing the concerns of taxpayers .
You know this in advance and that is what you agree to from the very start .
A tax concession for assistants is moreover a political precursor to measures by which Members would also be subject to the so @-@ called EU tax .
It is difficult to reach an entente among nations in respect of maintaining a dignified level of humanity in working populations .
In a European Union of fifteen Member States , committed to enlargement , with eleven official languages and a multitude of regional languages , it is actually very important to make the citizens of the Union aware of the advantages of understanding and speaking other languages and of the many opportunities that exist for learning to do so .
I am therefore pleased that my amendment concerning human dignity - unique to each person , yet common to all and inviolable - obtained support in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , for we must establish a common view of human beings as the effective basis for the EU &apos; s urgent , global fight against the death penalty , its struggle on the side of life and also its fight against torture , against the sex trade and against sexual exploitation .
As a first step towards this objective , a proportion of these taxes should accrue to the Union budget , on the basis of an agreement between the Member States on certain types of tax .
Given that the Commission is the EU institution with which citizens have most reason to have material contact , it is normal that it should be the principal target of inquiries .
I can only agree , and stress that this reform should start with a re @-@ think from the roots - namely development policy - upwards .
This final stage represents a considerable challenge . It entails the citizens or their representatives in each Member State appropriating the text , if I may put it like that .
The Member States need to make full use of the potential provided by ICTs in order to meet the targets set by the climate and energy package of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 % , increasing the proportion of energy derived from renewable sources to 20 % and achieving a 20 % improvement in energy efficiency in the European Union by 2020 .
In this respect , the report from Mrs Gomes , whom I would like to congratulate on the job she has done , highlights the serious shortcomings in the respect for human rights , which we are duty @-@ bound to tackle .
Mrs Jäätteenmäki made special mention of transparency and I fully agree with what she said when she remarked that what was most important was public access to documents .
The proposal provides for a reduction in total emissions of sulphur dioxide of about 1 million tonnes , of the 3 million tonnes required by the acidification strategy .
Thank you , Commissioner .
Our amendments suggest that sections of that second part should be amendable by a simplified procedure - maybe not all of it , that may cause insurmountable problems , but at least part of it .
I am convinced that we can also be more successful in areas such as trade and investments at bilateral and regional level .
How can we expect European products to be used throughout the world , when we are cannot even agree on certain technical conditions and interoperability in Europe ?
In this declaration , the European Union clearly sets out the obligations to which it expects both parties to adhere straight away .
Since this summit was attended by the leaders of the four largest and dominant States in the EU and since the statements both by the Belgian Presidency and the other governments of the EU on the events at Genoa suggest that there will be a more violent and bloody response to demonstrations at future summit meetings , starting with Laeken , will the Council say whether it is aware of the very onerous political responsibility it bears for its decisions of 13 and 16 July to take repressive measures and whether it intends to revoke them , given that they are in flagrant breach of democratic freedoms and human rights , such as freedom of movement , of assembly and of expression , which were brutally violated in Genoa ?
The voting behaviour of the conservative side demonstrated a lack of any desire to create a level playing field for third country citizens legally resident within the Union .
If he lives near a school or a youth club , for example , the police and the public should be given that information .
One aim here should be to bring about a general improvement in the Commission &apos;s administrative machinery , and not only in the tourism sector .
It is an economic cost in terms of passive labour market support and it is a social cost in terms of increased exclusion and the spread of drug abuse and crime .
This multi @-@ annual programme will enable us - or so I hope - to start to turn European energy policy around , and , in particular , the use of energy - a subject on which we have adopted many framework directives already - must be one of our priorities for the future .
Mrs d &apos;Ancona said again that harmonisation is not possible at present .
However , I believe constructive agreement is the way forward .
It follows that a sudden outbreak of conflicts and a permanent suppression of human rights on our doorstep constitutes a threat to stability and democracy in the Member States of the EU itself .
This is no way for a Parliament that is supposed to be serious to conduct its foreign policy and relations with other countries in other parts of the world .
Obviously , as President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , you are well aware that this is a problem which runs up against historical and political obstacles arising from the fact that , in the fullest and strictest sense , the territory of Gibraltar does not belong to the European Union , because it is a colony . The British government recognized that fact many years ago in an official communication to the United Nations , which has never been amended .
Mr Ortuondo , you have the floor on a point of order .
Such facts do not fit in with liberalisation mania .
If not , do you intend - now that a further month has passed since May - to take any initiatives to request the Spanish authorities no longer to block the process initiated by the Spanish judiciary ?
In its communication , the European Commission itself acknowledges that this reform will also lead to the closure of sugar production plants .
The removal of policy barriers and the creation of synergy between different activities which have a direct effect on the European maritime space are objectives which we must not forget .
The role of the European Union in former Yugoslavia is much more overtly political , since many Member States have sent troops there to support the diplomatic and humanitarian efforts .
Where smuggling practices persist and even involve tobacco manufacturers , the European Commission will need to take additional measures .
The possibility of a marginal 5 % increase in European budgets only seems a lot to Her Majesty , the Queen of England .
This is because we believe that it will only work if , firstly , the Member States realise that only the joint institutions can act and that bilateral initiatives also weaken the individuals concerned , even if they think that it makes them appear particularly powerful in the media .
It is also regrettable that the amendments tabled by the Greens and the GUE / NGL group , which were directly taken from the Rasmussen draft report , were not adopted during the plenary vote .
I particularly welcome Parliament &apos;s recommendations on crisis management and on strengthening producer organisations .
However , given that the public prosecutor has referred the case , calling for these six children to be sentenced to up to five years &apos; imprisonment on the basis of the charges , I should like to know if there is something else we can do and exactly how long you intend to wait .
We can help local authorities to implement related EU policies and to make best use of EU funding .
How can it be that the Commission supposedly has hardly any officials to implement more than 1 000 projects , and how can we reconcile what you have said with the fact that 200 projects have not been implemented ?
The fact that it is certain that jobs will be lost and small and medium @-@ sized companies will close has also been ignored .
Mr Ribeiro is right : we must seek out new ways of achieving the objectives of the Treaty to enable us to measure EMU against Europe &apos;s real needs - combatting mass unemployment and overcoming the environmental crisis . We constantly refer to these objectives as our highest priority , without really suiting the action to the word .
First of all , I too would like to say that we think these three programmes , the Youth programme , the Leonardo programme and the Socrates programme , really form a single entity , a general framework to which the European Commission , with its specific proposal , is adding flesh and bones .
Unfortunately , the Commission has not yet provided the benchmarking data for this key indicator .
Otherwise , in a year &apos;s time we are going to have to repeat many of today &apos;s remarks .
One voice and one minute to remind everyone of unemployment and social decline and the share of responsibility borne by the nominative criteria which served to impose a policy even though they were proved to be unattainable .
Up to now , we have mainly been working with directives where harmonisation is concerned .
.
The statements on risks posed by genetic modification cite manufacturers &apos; reports and the involvement of genetic modification lobbyists is clear .
Therefore , at the final vote , I voted against adoption of the joint resolution .
To my alarm I discover that some in this Parliament are willing to accept political responsibility .
We owe that to the safety and health of Europe &apos;s citizens and population .
This will enable Turkey &apos;s progress to be addressed .
But I think we should make much more of it .
We have to be very careful that we do not do the same with the car industry .
As regards our support for the implementation of the Cairo Programme of Action , the European Community provided approximately EUR 655 million in direct support to these activities between 1994 and 2001 .
This will be possible in the long term if the political will is there to achieve complete harmonisation .
This lack of proportion quickly became apparent , given that the partnership and cooperation agreement was unable to cover sufficient sectors , such as close cooperation on judicial matters and internal affairs , on foreign policy and defence matters , on the questions of the non @-@ proliferation of nuclear weapons , combating terrorism and other matters .
We have considerable work to do , therefore , and hopes for a REACH @-@ free year in 2007 are unlikely to be fulfilled .
Mr Wijkman ’ s report makes it clear that living up to the Kyoto requirements is the first priority of the EU .
Cohesion policy is the best proof of the solidarity which exists in the European Union .
Thus , it was not for nothing that many people became very worked up over these revelations .
Was there some mysterious power at work or did Mr Ganley &apos;s funds have something to do with the outcome ?
One object of this report is that the circus should be recognised , as a matter of course , as part of European culture .
I think it is the general view that the report has been improved by a number of the amendments made and I want to focus quickly on some of them : the emphasis on consumers , with specific proposals adding that we support the idea of private competition and enhancing the role of the consumer liaison officer .
I merely need to cite an example in the form of Article 101a of the proposal concerning Europol &apos;s access to the Schengen Information System .
It appears from the proposal that that is a problem .
Subject : Laeken Declaration Annex IV of the Nice Treaty contains a declaration calling for a deeper and wider debate about the future development of the EU .
On the other hand , it is also becoming necessary to restrict the commercialisation of culture .
I fully share the view that it is unfortunate that entry into force has been postponed until 2012 .
The Commission will present its proposal on the implementation of a single financial framework at a later date .
There was a security breach in Sellafield last week and Sellafield &apos;s storage facility for nuclear waste - which is called &apos; pond B30 &apos; - is one of the biggest problems for the nuclear sector in Europe .
We have dealt with other subjects and we have mentioned our idea that other subjects may be dealt with in this conference , if the Portuguese Presidency firstly , and then the French Presidency , so wish , in view of the serious nature of the present juncture prior to enlargement .
A large number of the original proposals have been cut out , with the result that it is in no way ambitious .
This is why I believe that the European Union and Parliament have , in this case , taken very appropriate action with this report , which will really contribute to the development of the European and Bulgarian economies .
Admittedly , I cannot expect you to give specific figures , but I would like to have a general idea .
This document , which has been rejected by the majority of Members , was a piece of legislation which would have enabled flows of migrants to be better managed .
In this context , relations between the European Union and Canada are the guarantee of readjustment .
At the summit , think tanks , contacts with NGOs and new networks were discussed .
By saying that I am being consistent : I said the same to Mrs Müller in the Green Group when she did that .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , the central feature of this package - travelling for non @-@ hospital treatment outside the home country - is funding by the home country , but limited to the amount it would have cost there .
According to the rapporteur this is a terrible headache , yet young men and women are increasingly coming to realise that inflexibility will not help them to find work .
We may be fighting terrorism , but we cannot do so with arms that are not democratic .
It is not authorised for sale in the European Union .
I should like the Council and the Commissioner to indicate whether we can agree on the above @-@ mentioned approach .
In this case , taking it seriously means having the support of the people who want to implement these measures .
I do not need a Council representative here in order to tell them that I think they are undemocratic .
The fact is , people already pay for the licence , pay road tax , pay a pile of other taxes , and in my view they should not have to pay another annual tax as well .
Now , Commissioner Barnier has just presented a communication on developments concerning the implementation of the Structural Funds , providing us with a number of explanations as to why larger outstanding commitments than expected are accumulating , and that is something for which we should thank the Commissioner .
That is not so .
The views expressed by those in the House seeking to force early closure and abandonment of the policy in this matter made voting for elements of this report very difficult for pragmatic reasons rather than a particularly pro- or anti @-@ nuclear approach .
The rapporteur sends a shiver down my spine when he speaks of social aberrations , social instincts .
The committee took great care over its work - and I would especially like to thank its chairperson - although a more conservative , extremely cautious interpretation prevailed in the end , for we did not want to push the boat out too far , since the directive will be supplemented on the basis of three years &apos; monitoring of the use of spare parts for the purpose of repair .
However , based on our experiences with other countries , I would say that Croatia needs to work on reforming its judicial and administrative systems in its own interests , too - irrespective of the accession process .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , for more than a month , a group of 250 people , including 80 Eritreans , have been held hostage by traffickers in the Sinai Desert in Egypt .
The final text is not the one Parliament would have liked , since at first reading it stated its desire for binding objectives .
I practically have to assume that you wanted to have your innocence certified by Parliament , and then , when perhaps in about another six months &apos; time , it came out that yet more scandalous things had been going on , it would be easy for you to say : &apos; Oh please , Parliament sanctioned what we did ! &apos;
We should be clear again today that we are seeing the beginning , not the end , of a process .
It is a false flexibility .
Your speech today talked very little of people .
Mr President , we are going to vote on a report today that has caused a political stir in certain EU States .
The fact is that as we go into the twenty @-@ first century , we need to set about extending the traditional 18th- and 19thcentury concept of civil human rights to include a number of basic rights which are of fundamental importance to people in Europe and throughout the world .
I ask Parliament to adopt it and the Commission to take it over .
It would be impossible to imagine a more comprehensive assault on his liberty .
Quite apart from the question of cloning , I find that the ethical principles in the field of biotechnology are not the same in the various Member States .
Finally , although we may be discussing Turkey , let us not forget that it is equally important for Europe to open association negotiations with Ukraine in the future .
I am worried in particular about the four amendments proposed on behalf of the ALDE and GUE / NGL Groups , once again forcing the European Parliament to make decisions on matters which fall within the sovereignty of Member States .
Thank you very much Mrs Maes .
An attempt which was made , partly on the Commission &apos; s initiative , failed in Nice .
Enlargement is not a concession made to the candidate countries .
The different needs of different regions also need to be taken into account .
In particular I urge Member States to make a real effort at coordination - to improve cooperation amongst themselves and with European institutions .
More of the same .
In conclusion , Mr President , I would once more like to thank the rapporteur warmly , as well as all Members of the European Parliament who contributed to the preparation of the draft report .
I therefore voted in favour of this report , because I think it has the merit of having achieved a good compromise , the main aim of which is to protect patients so that they do not take falsified medicines .
Welcome , colleagues .
The proof is , first , that it confirms adherence to the convergence criteria every Member State must satisfy .
We need to pay particular attention to cases of database loss or misuse , and there should also be a mutual exchange of information on this matter between the Member States .
in writing . - The EPLP believes that the upgrading of VAT requirements for financial services has been long overdue .
I would say that , on the cancellation of debt , little progress has been made .
Much is at stake with the forthcoming elections in this densely populated country .
As rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties , I hold positions that essentially coincide with nearly all of his .
Two brief comments on agricultural policy .
I wish you good luck !
I shall just say that I personally have become aware that something important has happened with the ultimate collapse of the WTO Conference in Cancún .
No concern at all is shown about social rights , about reinforcing provisions that protect working people , or about any commitment to incorporate the basic ILO conventions in the WTO system .
Mr President , that investment in convergence was an investment in prosperity .
This raises the question as to the purpose of Community solidarity .
The question was as follows : how could they simultaneously sign visa exemptions for Hong Kong nationals on the one hand , and a re @-@ admission agreement on the other , in the knowledge that , I fear , visa exemptions would allow many more illegal immigrants entry to the EU than the re @-@ admission agreement could ever send back to their country ?
Labour participation , company policy , taxes - these are all matters which should fall within the remit of the Member States .
It is strongly marked by old fashioned power politics.2.Realisation of the report &apos;s concepts of security policy would promote the division of the world into blocs and would develop a regional organisation in competition with the United Nations.3.The report &apos;s proposal on the Union &apos;s right to intervene in situations in other countries violates UN regulations and constitutes a danger to peace , stability and national independence.4.The report &apos;s statement on protecting the Union &apos;s &apos; interests and values &apos; stands out as highly questionable .
We have to offer our help to Libya – this is now being prepared and implemented – in its fight against AIDS , and in order to improve its healthcare system so that it can , at least , cope with this tragedy which is affecting the people concerned .
The Commission has estimated that half a million women a year are being trafficked although the true extent of the problem is unknown because of the secretive nature of the trade .

The Americans responded with a literal flood of resources .
We aim to complete the technical preparatory work on the legal framework of the Euro before the end of 1996 .

If we want to be successful , we must seriously consider using all the technologies available .
The debate is closed .
We have two ministerial summits coming up : the Euro @-@ Mediterranean summit already referred to , and the summit of EU and African leaders .
I am just happy that he is alive and able to continue campaigning , thus maintaining the broad field of candidates from which the Ukrainian people can choose .
In addition , provision is made for exceptions from environmental liability for emissions or activities for which a permit has been issued or which were not considered harmful when the permit was issued .
It follows that Mr Sacrédeus ’ appeal ought not to have been necessary , and that was the line we took ; that was what led to the Cyprus talks happening now .
Is this state of affairs to be accepted in the long term or will the Stability and Growth Pact be followed up and a stable environment ensured for EMU by adopting working methods of a type different from those involving recommendations and exhortations ?
The Commission has promised that during June it will provide information on actions that are still required and a more precise timetable for these .
In my opinion the compromise reached by the Transport Committee may help to resolve this problem .
We have practically done it already .
This , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , is the Europe we do not like , the Europe which tries or seeks to make progress in the economic and monetary sectors but remains passive or absent when it comes to political initiatives and international diplomacy : a one @-@ armed Europe .
As the reports on convergence from the Commission , the European Monetary Institute and the Bundesbank have reminded us , this stability will be obtained by keeping salaries in check and lowering the overall cost of labour .
I can only pass it on with an explicit request that Mr Kinnock reply to the question , which I shall do .
- Madam President , I did a lot of work with the car industry when I was fortunate enough to be the shadow rapporteur on the Sacconi report on CO2 emissions from cars and that convinced me more than anything of the huge strategic and commercial value that the car industry offers to us in Europe .
Your organisation , Mr Caldeira , provides an essential service for European taxpayers .
Some groups here have worked together to table a joint resolution expressing a reaction to the current situation in North Korea .
I should like to ask him why he attributes natural causes to a disaster that has clearly occurred as the result of political and therefore preventable reasons ?
At the same time this gives us in Europe the opportunity to pave the way for a more dynamic and open agricultural sector .
We can then hope that a solution will be found as soon as possible .
– Mr President , it is with great amazement that I see that , in a debate as important as this one , the Commission is conspicuous by its absence .
We look to the European Parliament to help us in this endeavour .
We need to be more active in carrying out scientific research that would lead to avoidance of the use of fossil fuels and suggest alternative methods of splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen .
Mr President , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , when dealing with the issue of European jurisdiction , limited itself to seconding the proposal for the Commission &apos;s preliminary draft , which provides for increases for two reasons ; the first being in consequence of enlargement , and the second in response to new tasks for European justice , in which context more funds are allocated for the purposes of documentation and translation .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Oomen for the huge amount of work she has done .
This is due legal process .
We wish you and the whole College of Commissioners well .
My sincere thanks to everyone who has taken part in the discussion and supported my report .
These trade preferences , which currently apply to Bosnia and Herzegovina , Serbia and Kosovo , were granted for a period ending on 31 December 2010 , but their validity should now be extended to 31 December 2015 so as not to jeopardise these countries &apos; economic recovery .
It remained open throughout the whole of Monday , and the minimum services required to support Members and any visitors were provided .
Disposal is to be used only as a last resort and comes after separate collection , recycling and so on .
Therefore , if we have recognized that starting point , we have also to be realistic about what can be achieved on a common policy starting from that particular difficulty .
Since waste management is a responsibility of the Member States , how can we force producers and distributors to recover 85 % ?
The concepts of subsidiarity and decentralization are blatantly abused in order to exclude undesirable intervention in their own territory .
Madam President , my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur on an excellent report .
With regard to the implementation and evaluation of this programme , the Commission has not exactly come up smelling of roses .
( ES ) Madam President , this is not the first time that I have spoken about Venezuela and the breaches of human rights that are occurring in that beautiful country and I fear it will not be the last .
The rapporteur is to be congratulated for his work on this document .
The European Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg has built up a body of case law on the interpretation of the scope of protection of private and family life which cannot and should not be called into question by this decision .
My group supports the appeal to the Malaysian Government to stop this behaviour and calls on the Council and the Commission to apply human rights as the essential criterion in its relations with Malaysia .
Following the ceasefire , which hopefully will hold up , prisoners of war have been exchanged and Norway has again asked for assistance .
in writing . - Until now the success of microcredit systems in relieving poverty in developing countries has up to now not been translated into the EU context .
Irresponsible speculation , greed for quick profits which are completely unrelated to the real economy in the Anglo @-@ Saxon countries and a financial system that is coming apart at the seams have brought the world to the brink of a financial abyss .
Instead of a directive , it would be better to adopt guidelines based on existing good practice in the Member States .
The Council has shown in the past that it is not single minded in this and it has unfortunately also repeatedly shown that it is not always single minded in really working to prevent fraud and to protect the EU &apos;s financial interests .
It is true that the Turkish Government is making some efforts to correct matters .
Especially worrisome and worthy of condemnation has been the recent fighting in and around Mogadishu and in the Jowhar region .
Being of a linguistic nature , this amendment only concerns the English version .
The desperate plight of the two million minority in the Karen tribe deserves special consideration here .
In this connection , I would like to direct your attention to item 5 of the report - I do not need to explain it at the moment - and to two events that show why we are so sceptical .
in writing . - Information regarding consumer products has become essential .
What is now before us is a so @-@ called light agreement , an agreement in which , to all intents and purposes , this House is off @-@ side .
Moreover , rushing out any old hasty document does not serve the end of parliamentary cooperation and does not serve to deal with this issue properly .
We have not seen much sign of great Nordic transparency .
Problems range from insufficient information to irregularities , even abuse with resources from the EU funds - &quot; disorders ” that do not spare any single EU Member State .
Mr Weber , Europe was born out of the values of the Second World War - a determination that we would never look away again whilst one group of individuals or other groups were targeted or made a scapegoat and led away to concentration camps and work camps .
Our main message at the meeting was to express how pressing we consider the human rights situation in Vietnam to be .
At the moment we are assuming that the Japanese engineers and technicians and the Japanese Government will regain control over this nuclear power plant complex and that further damage from the disaster can be avoided .
It is also important to ensure that there is a level playing field , in terms of competition , between transport companies in different Member States and between different modes of transport .
Argentina was for a decade their favourite pupil , opening up the markets , putting money into financial speculation instead of productive investments and increasing the debt enormously .
If competition is encouraged , it is essential that it be organised by an appropriate framework .
The next item is the report by Mrs Gebhardt ( A4 @-@ 0253 / 99 ) for the Parliament Delegation to the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council Directive establishing a mechanism for the recognition of qualifications in respect of the professional activities covered by the Directives on liberalisation and transitional measures and supplementing the general systems for the recognition of qualifications ( 3612 / 99 - C4 @-@ 0209 / 99 @-@ 96 / 0031 ( COD ) ) .
We have funded such activities from our budget since 2006 and my proposal for 2008 is to increase that funding for ATLAS up to EUR 900 000 .
The draft amendment in my original proposal recommended that , in order to coordinate our positions with the Commission , we draw up a detailed report on our organisational plans for devolution .
Is the Commission giving support to the proposal at the IGC from Greece and Spain to include a clause in the new treaty on islands ?
There was , for example , the regulation that , where evidence was gathered in one Member State and then , crime knowing no frontiers , was used in a cross @-@ frontier case before another court , it could be objected to on the grounds that it had been gathered in accordance with administrative law .
&apos;The Sri Lankan Government forces indiscriminately attacked all parts of the &apos; safe zone &apos; using every kind of lethal shells , some of them banned in many countries .
Once again , attention has focused on fires in tunnels .
It would be wrong to give in to attempts to demonise GM foods and feedstuffs .
. When what is really required is a sea change in the orientations and objectives of Community policies , by revoking the Stability and Growth Pact and replacing it with a Growth and Employment Pact , along with root and branch changes to the Lisbon strategy in order to put an end to the liberalisations and privatisations in industries and essential public services and to give absolute priority to the creation of jobs with rights and to the fight against poverty and social exclusion , the Commission continues to follow the path of even greater liberalisation ; that is , more of the same .
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has , in fact , adopted three amendments by Mr Méndez de Vigo , which , for the purposes of the implementation of the interinstitutional agreement within Parliament , give a special role to Parliament &apos; s President herself , to whom all information regarding the Members will be sent .
Secondly , I would argue in favour of a large @-@ scale investment in the development of new , clean energy .
( Applause )
It is a matter of urgency for the Union &apos;s lawyers - taking advantage of the new freedom offered by this directive - to forge organic links between their practices and set up European practices which are capable of resisting the competition of large firms from outside the Community .
This is particularly alarming 60 years after the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , and is a call to us to redouble our efforts .
Mr President , Commissioner , today , at last , we have an opportunity to express our opinion on the new cooperation agreement concluded with Bangladesh .
The farmer is the first person to confront a forest fire .
The strengthening of the internal market , ensuring larger profits for the big economic and financial groups of the European powers , is at the root of the growing inequalities within the EU , between states and within each state .
The directive is unclear and is not fraud @-@ proof .
What do we think of this ?
Madam President , the road to hell is paved with good intentions .
Next week the Commission will make concrete proposals on how we can reinforce economic policy coordination and Member States budgetary surveillance in the European Union .
When will the Court &apos;s internal auditor finally complete at least some of the tasks listed in his programme of work and make them available to us ?
Secondly , we need better coordination between the European Union and international humanitarian aid organisations , especially the United Nations .
The Commission will take steps to ensure that many of your suggestions are taken into consideration by the Member States in the final version of the regulation .
With the results we have decided upon , that will mean that in 10 to 15 years , in Central Europe , we shall have to cordon off all cities between Nuremberg and Bologna because we cannot keep within the values that have been set .
It is more informative , more colourful , so to speak , and clearer .
The rapporteur states that &apos; there is no doubt that ? halting immigration must be superseded &apos; on the basis , on the one hand of the &apos; Treaty of Amsterdam , which confers competence on the Community in the areas of asylum and immigration &apos; , and on the other , on what she calls &apos; actual necessity &apos; .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mozambique is a young African country which has made heroic efforts to recover from the underdevelopment resulting from two decades of civil war and to adapt to democracy .
We must also remember that , following the latest enlargement , Belarus has become a direct neighbour – we have shared borders – and , in this regard , it is all the more important to us that it becomes a democratic , stable and prosperous country .
But what really appals me - and here I refer to the Council in particular - is that it is already two years since Parliament expressed its opinion at the first reading of the only instrument which would allow us to deal effectively with these issues , the information and consultation directive , and in these two years , despite the general agreement that dialogue is the best way to deal with problems , the Council has not yet been able to summon up the courage or the strength to adopt a position on the matter .
As you know , the Austrian Presidency , in particular , has attempted in recent months to step up cooperation with the countries of South @-@ East Europe and of the Western Balkans , to make some progress in the interests of stability and peace in Europe .
But our group does not believe that the annual technical amendment , Mr Pronk , is the right way to achieve this .
Furthermore , sport is becoming more and more professional , and there is a need for good training for sportswomen and sportsmen so that after their careers they can return to society .
We had to fight for this , but it has been achieved .
For example , Italy has recently adopted a code of conduct that regulates the relationship between the television industry and minors and it seems to me this is moving things along in the right direction .
The Middle East , Pakistan , Afghanistan , Russia , defence , security and economic and commercial matters are discussed in detail .
However , a minimum level of economic convergence is needed to achieve this , and also to create a level playing field for the applicant countries and the present EU Member States .
We also demand the organization of free , democratic elections and the release of all political prisoners , without exception , especially those who have been in death row for 32 years and who originate from East Timor , such as Gusmão .
The Council urged the Uzbek authorities to comply with their international obligations in terms of democracy , the rule of law and human rights .
This is firstly because structural reforms cost money and are payable per head , which means that expenses are incurred before any benefits are felt ; secondly , because the nature of national public finances is increasingly less predisposed towards public investment , particularly the least visible kind of public investment that has difficulty attracting party support in the short term ; and thirdly , because the restrictive and blinkered implementation of budgetary consolidation policies blocks any kind of effort focused exclusively on this reforming area , which , given the crucial nature of this area , is clearly an inadequate state of affairs .
I will come back to this point later on .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Varela , as you know , on 15 October the Council finally accepted the mandate for the commencement of negotiations with the Kingdom of Morocco .
I believe that your manner of presiding in this case has been rather unfortunate .
This means working today to bring tomorrow &apos;s technology rapidly on stream .
The agreement will , however , in principle , be submitted for consultation , so the European Parliament will have ample opportunity to express its views on the agreement .
Another negative event was the forced evacuation of the Chechen refugee camp in Akiyurt just before Christmas , which was also described by the European Union as a violation of the international humanitarian principle that displaced persons should be returned to their place of origin solely of their own free will , without the pressure that was applied in that case .
I do share his view that we must be watchful that American partners do not drive our European lines to the wall in these alliances , but we also cannot let the Directorate @-@ General IV see the Single Market as a total area in which it will judge the competition situation .
Structural measures are not enough to combat poverty .
This is a sound document , and the reference to the principle that prevention is better than cure is very apt indeed .
All the same , we must not lose sight of the consequences of the coming changes for the men and women who make their living from producing sugar in the fields and factories of the Community and in the developing countries .
So , with a heavy heart , the reserve remains in the budget , and until such a time as we recognize that the situation is improving .
Fourthly , enlargement .
The countries neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina - as Hannes Swoboda said - will most probably reach the target more quickly , which is why it is our job to keep helping Bosnia and Herzegovina to find the right path and to then join the European Union once the conditions have been met .
We can already imagine what will happen when these instruments expire .
Moreover , as you will be aware , Yushchenko has gone to the Supreme Court to contest the election results .
If we dare to make a courageous proposal here , and you , Mr Habsburg , reconsider the matter with the Green Party , then we shall be on the right path and your memory will be honoured .
Mr President , I should like to thank the House for the debate .
The Council should be very much involved and should come forward in the very near future with plans and with some hope of a definite outcome in this important area .
We should also look at the instruments for the improvement of the enforcement of EU environmental legislation at our disposal at present and consider whether these could be further developed or put to better use .
I demand that it should be declared inadmissible .
Timor , Moluccas , Aceh , Papua and now Borneo @-@ Kalimantan all show this .
It is the EU &apos;s fault that this or that decision went the wrong way ; there , too , there is a need for action , and that is why - just as the report demands - it is important that dialogue among the Council , the Commission , Parliament , and the public , be encouraged , for with it , perhaps , we might stand a chance .
Yes , I think that we are effective , but we will never be effective enough .
What situations are priorities ?
Unfortunately , international attention was focused on how extremely divided we were ; this division was chiefly based on economic advantage .
– Madam President , with the entry into force of the new Financial Regulation , the subsidies of the former Part A and some of them from the former Part B of the Budget , which did not have basic instruments , required those basic instruments to be adopted in order to be implemented .
European farmers are worried that only applying restrictions to them will oust them from production and that they will not be able to produce on competitive terms .
What is more , flexibility is very well served by the solution formulated in Parliament &apos;s first reading .
Mr President , firstly with regard to tobacco : the campaign against tobacco is a sham , a fraud .
I sympathize with the rapporteur when he talks about the internalization of external costs , but that naturally applies to all forms of transport and thus to railways too , in all honesty .
Rather it is increasing , and , just as others have said , a great many of those affected are women and children .
I would like to request that this should be put to the vote again . You have not done that !
The EU 2020 initiative is calling on Member States to contribute and we have heard from the rapporteurs ( whom I thank greatly for their reports ) about the fact that Member States need to contribute to the completing of the single market .
Mr President , my compliments naturally go to the rapporteur , Mr van Velzen .
Thank you , Commissioner Vitorino .
Therefore , I ask the Council to unblock the dossier on the review of the European Solidarity Fund regulation , to request its immediate review and not to reject the new regulation .
I do not need to say that we shall closely follow both the preparations and the holding of the elections .
Again , I am very grateful to the Committee on Transport and Tourism and particularly to the rapporteur , Mr Kaklamanis , who has done a characteristically thorough job yet again .
I trust that national governments will do more in future to implement EU legislation in this regard .
MEPs have been discussing the Commission &apos;s action plan on energy efficiency in the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , and it seems to me that there is the political will in Parliament for a radical revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive .
This will be done in April , something else I can confirm to you .
As we know , the IGC is not going to consider the problem . To me , this seems like burying one &apos;s head in the sand , since the problem of own resources and the sufficiency of resources for the policies we announce is an issue of great importance .
Because Parliament and the Commission cannot agree about what access we have to information .
( DE ) Mr President , for its 60th birthday in 2005 , the United Nations gave itself two new structures . The first was the Peacebuilding Commission and the second was the Human Rights Council .
The next item is the statement from the Commission on the proposals for the reform of the beef and veal market .
Therefore , as Russia itself now prefers post @-@ Soviet authoritarian nationalism to any ‘ orange ’ renovation there is a growing danger that Belarus will be forcibly merged with Putinist Russia , the basis for which was laid down in advance .
Madam President , I must say that I fully understand what they are going through in Pakistan , but I would also say that this decision is tragic for Europe and , particularly , for some countries that are already experiencing serious difficulties , such as Portugal , Spain and Greece .
The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Presidentin @-@ Office of the Council of the European Union , Mr Dini , is also here now .
We need to show commitment to bolster support for the political union publicly , in our own countries , because this is not just a central responsibility , but also the crucial point , if we want to move forward with European integration .
Two harsh winters in succession will probably spell the end of a nation of shepherds and of economic developments in Mongolia .
Are most of these cases - and I assume they are - Belgian cases or are officials in other Member States being prosecuted for corruption ?
Citizens and small businesses are not always aware of the potential effects .
in writing . - ( FR ) The report by Guy Bono on cultural industries in Europe reaffirms the importance of the cultural dimension in the implementation of the Lisbon objectives .
Therefore , children of poorer families , who do not have access to certain milk products having essential nutritional benefits , can make up the shortfall thanks to the meals offered in their school canteens .
The funds could then be distributed to sectors benefiting citizens .
The real point here is that , with the proclamation of this Charter , another step is taken towards a federal Europe .
Therefore it is important that we actually give shop stewards and workers &apos; representatives these tools to sort out the problems prior to them going to court .
The second measure involves the systems to limit catches .
This contrasts with the clear political will to make concrete progress in the defence field , a will that we appreciate .
The last imperative is to prevent small businesses being eliminated .
It should end in transparent charging practices and ensure that companies can no longer surcharge consumers when using credit cards .
A Union is being constructed which , instead of opposing the barbarity of the United States , goes along or competes with it on a dangerous and absurd path , which may lead to the destruction of our very planet .
The time has come to simplify and speed up the recovery procedure .
I talked for an hour the other evening with Mr Sharon about the pointlessness of maintaining the present siege .
Naturally , the chances for national reconciliation will greatly improve if President Musharraf and the relevant authorities do whatever is necessary to ensure that these elections are held in a fair and transparent manner .
We can confirm that the situation in Kosovo is improving .
( Applause )
We have got to persuade them to allow humanitarian assistance to reach those most in need , and we have , perhaps , to help them ensure the safety of those humanitarian aid workers .
On the other hand , the new authorities in the Republic of Moldova are facing enormous difficulties .
You will be aware , however , that they were adopted unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture .
Mr President , Commissioner , the directive on the regulation of vehicles with more than eight seats in addition to the driver &apos;s seat - generally known as buses - is aimed at standardizing the type approval system in the context of the Single Market and at the same time improving safety .
I should like to take as an example one proposed amendment .
We want the current regime to stay in place in some format .
Two days ago the Legal Service of Parliament , acting as the agents of the House and , under that power of delegation , made a presentation to the European Court of Justice in respect of a case brought by Eurotunnel on the sensitive question of duty @-@ free sales .
On the contrary , it will only be an obstacle to it .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank my colleague , Mr Schnellhardt , for his question .
Mr President , honourable Members , just over 50 years ago six countries laid the foundation for European cooperation .
As far as I can see , there are three reasons for this .
I am convinced that during the first week that we will meet here there will be this trialogue .
Privately , I still cannot explain why two @-@ thirds of votes should be needed .
In principle we can accept this modification , but we need to complete it by adding the words &apos; securities settlement systems &apos; .
If we slow down , some of the accession countries - for example , Hungary - will turn elsewhere , perhaps towards the United States rather than the European Union .
First of all , the Court in Strasbourg has , in the sense of res judicata , acquired much broader capabilities than those provided for under fundamental rights , as both the Presidency and Commissioner Reding have hinted .
I am all for the free market and can support any proposal that is market @-@ orientated .
It has always been the stated aim of Parliament and the Commission to preserve diversity of food production in a European Union of 27 Member States .
We will be holding a joint meeting between Ministers for Education and Science , an informal Council , in Sweden on 2 and 3 March , on the subject of science , society and education in the sciences ; we will also be holding an initial discussion between Ministers for Research on the future Framework Programme .
Our Committee adopted the Fourtou report unanimously , with only one abstention .
So , firstly , what is the European Union doing to ensure that end to the war is declared ?
Furthermore , I feel that mainstreaming and empowerment were consolidated in this Conference , and also the fight against poverty and trafficking in human beings , but that there was an absence of tangible , verifiable objectives such as the need for a greater representation of women in the institutions and also for projects to fight poverty .
Mr President , my group asked that this debate be set up in order to provide Parliament with an opportunity to express its solidarity with the people directly affected by this ecological disaster , affected both in terms of their economic activities and in terms of their attachment to their natural environment .
We agree with Parliament here - measuring the exact impact of such schemes can often be very difficult , particularly given the different fiscal and social security schemes that exist in the Member States .
Furthermore , the proposed interinstitutional monitoring committee - on which , of course , this Parliament will be represented - will have a significant role in ensuring all of this .
Moreover , I would remind the House that , pursuant to Rule 110 ( 2 ) , &apos; Parliament shall decide whether to take such disciplinary action at a time to be decided by the President , which shall be either at the sitting during which the events in question occurred or at one of the three following sittings &apos; .
I would therefore like to take the opportunity to urge the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen to follow up how , and how successfully , this is actually carried out so that we know whether the consumers of Europe understand what the labelling means from now on .
This is the cornerstone of democracy .
Even competition cannot do that without supply , however , which means , I believe , that security of supply , of natural gas in particular , will depend very much on a European foreign policy for energy , in other words diversification and security of supply through access to gas .
These are achievements .
TACIS has achieved good results in this area .
It is necessary if only to avoid contradictions , with the Commission saying one thing , the Council saying another , the Parliament saying something else .
The most vulnerable are those in Bangladesh , eastern China and Vietnam .
To sum up , I would stress that in order to improve the problems of real water shortages , it is our priority to take action to stem the causes of desertification , and we can do this because most of these causes are human ones .
We are , however , in an absurd situation in which we spend five times more money on tobacco subsidies than on promoting public health , that is to say five times more money on ruining people ’ s health than on improving it .
I also see a further problem , namely that we would be deducting tax revenue for developed countries which need this income for their own sustainable development in future .
The next summons , to Dublin in October , threatens to find the European partners still very distant from each other on political union , on the enlargement , and on economic union . The silence is especially deafening on how to achieve political union without setting a serious timetable for common foreign and defence policy .
We have had a case before of a united opposition calling for economic sanctions in a situation where democracy was being trampled on .
Mr President , the results of the Madrid Summit can be read from various points of view .
The independence of the alternative operators , and especially of the interface , is something that we should not underestimate in the future .
I think it is very relevant that it is jointly agreed by the Council , Parliament and the Commission .
I guess that , when the number of the unemployed reaches 25 million in Europe , you will proudly stand here and say that our stimulus is now 5 % of GDP .
Such information would tell the consumer nothing .
I would draw attention to one final amendment , which is important .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , Minister , Commissioner , we are all aware that the loss of biological diversity is having widespread environmental , social , economic and cultural effects , further exacerbated by the negative influence of climate change .
Madam President , Indonesia is an area of the world that has been criticized many times in this Parliament , particularly because of East Timor .
I shall vote in favour of it with determination and conviction .
But there are also areas where there have already been successful reforms : the reform of central , regional and local government , in which the number of voivodeships has been reduced , health care reform to introduce medical insurance , and reform of the pension system .
Macro @-@ economic equilibrium needs to be promptly re @-@ established and maintained ; economic reform , particularly in the financial sector , transparency in economic @-@ decision making and better corporate governance all need to be pursued urgently .
Advocating the independence of an MEP &apos;s mandate is the responsibility of Parliament , and that independence cannot be jeopardised .
The main legal basis is an interpretation of a treaty which has not yet been ratified or entered into force , the Amsterdam Treaty . I find that strange .
– We shall bear it in mind , Mrs Ludford .
The direct costs of this are estimated at EUR 200 million per year .
The process of extending digital collections is very expensive and will take many more years .
The 2003 reform is an unmistakable step forward which ought to help our agricultural sector protect the environment and health , and it was in this spirit in 2005 that we voted in favour of the new EAFRD Regulation replacing the EAGGF - Guarantee section .
To hand the choice of cultural city over to the Member States is to trivialize completely the role of European City of Culture and , my apologies for saying this , but you are playing into the hands of the Member States and not that of the Community that you should be defending .
I wish you success .
We therefore have to acquire a better understanding of the consequences that all this may have for human health , and especially that of the most vulnerable members of society , so that we become better able to manage the risks involved .
This court case is glaring proof of the absolute lack of my will on the part of the regime to meet the commitments given to the international community , including the EU , to begin the transition to democracy .
Finally , it is doubtless not without interest to note that the partnership thus cemented with this great nation of the south may contribute to the creation of synergy useful to the European Union within the framework of the delicate negotiations which are about to be opened within the WTO at the Seattle Conference in November .
As far as the American bases in the European Union are concerned , they were not , I think , the subject of the question and I shall not therefore express a view on them .
It is a fact that , from the day I took up office and became involved in health issues , I realised that there is indeed a gender dimension – a difference between the two sexes – in health issues .
As I said in my first speech , I am totally in favour of conducting research into raw materials recycling .
We have planned that the European economy should flourish with the Lisbon Strategy .
Parliament stood its ground on that point and then pressurised the Council - or , let us be honest , forced the Council - to break new ground in voting by a majority - not unanimously , mind you - to approve the compromise with us , which includes what is termed a small revision .
I do not blame Austrian voters , I blame the political parties which , with great facility , sometimes say what the people want to hear and play on the sentiments of exclusion and racism .
I cannot support this report in its entirety .
However , we will need all our efforts to make progress in relation to China .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ office of the Council , thank you for the information you have given us .
That is why it is right that the embargo on China should remain in place , and so countries such as the Netherlands , the United Kingdom , Ireland , the Scandinavian countries , Poland and the Czech Republic , which , in the Council , are still saying that they want the embargo to stay , have my full support .
In conclusion to that debate , I underlined the fact that not only the Council , but also the Commission and Parliament , had a role to play and I have been won over to the idea put forward by your friends in the European Parliament , that is , the establishment of direct contact with your counterparts in the Algerian Parliament .
Let us go beyond our national selfishness which is leading straight into disaster .
For this reason , I welcome this proposal , which I consider to be very important and which will ensure greater safety in transport .
.I share the rapporteur ’ s position on Community policy in the field of defence equipment and congratulate him on the balance he has managed to achieve in an area of obvious importance and sensitivity , and which often provides the backdrop to the most deeply held differences of opinion .
I would , however , like to touch on a few basic points , a few of the points underlying this document , so that we will then be able to work together to improve and add to it .
The Council &apos;s common position incorporates only some of Parliament &apos;s proposals . These include express recognition of the fact that the Member States must guarantee a high level of social protection .
The situation is quite good in the EU generally , but at the same time poverty is not diminishing .
I would stress the need for effective monitoring both of recipients , and of altruistic and voluntary donors , to whom the public cannot fail to owe a debt of gratitude .
We should consider how we turn the ideas we share into a common reality .
The purification of ballast water is a simple procedure that must be undertaken across the board .
Our latest Eurobarometer survey shows that 68 % of our citizens support the idea and principle of having a European Constitution .
This way , we would avoid damaging the water bases and natural treasures along the Danube .
Furthermore , in the areas covered by Title IV , we are still seeing a persistent imbalance , rightly condemned by the rapporteur , between the relative ease with which agreements are concluded on the repressive elements of controlling immigration and the ongoing inability to establish common policies in the field of asylum and regulating legal immigration , specifically in the field of civil rights and social integration .
Another point on which we cannot agree is the call to increase our efforts for Turkey to join Europe .
If you look at how much public money has been spent to date on social measures , and how much we intend to spend on social measures in future , it will become clear that this reform very definitely has a social dimension .
Nevertheless , also in accordance with the report , I recognise that the fragility of the European economy is not the result of its monetary policy , but is essentially due to the absence of structural reforms aimed at greater international and global competitiveness .
As the Lithuanian Supreme Council adopted a declaration of independence , in Tallinn , the first session of the Congress of Estonia passed a declaration on restoring the legal state power in that still Soviet @-@ occupied state .
How many generations of ministers of all persuasions have been suddenly afflicted with amnesia in the course of moving between Brussels and their own capitals ?
Obviously , this report was produced at a time when the earliest information about Agenda 2000 was just becoming known .
The Security Council ’ s Resolution 1559 is not yet applicable to Damascus .
These timeframes and careful evaluations must not affect the dignity of the migrants , which must always be protected in any case .
The message should be heard loud and clear in the European Union , it really should : people do not want it .
We are also honouring the victims of the Holocaust , or in other words the genocide committed against the Jews in Europe during the Second World War , which was a crime that has no parallel in human history .
Mr President , relocation of industry to cheaper wage economies leaves in its wake economic and social hardship which divides rather than unites the regions of Europe .
Experience will show whether the formulations to be adopted will correspond in all respects to these objectives .
In his report on the financial perspective , he is right to draw our attention to the considerable underspending of appropriations for structural measures in 2000 .
It is suffering as a result of an authoritarian regime presiding over a ruined economy and it is in the values of the European Union that these people are putting their hope .
This is where the Eurobonds are necessary .
Terrorism is a direct assault on freedom , human rights and democracy .
Until all EU policies are guided by these principles , programmes will continue to conflict .
Therefore , I think that the practice of testing for fraudulence as regards the main subject matter of the contract and for price adequacy should be initiated .
Generally , albeit not entirely or in every single detail , the way the Committee voted reflects the position taken by the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , and we agree with the Commission and with Mr Fava , the rapporteur , on the substance of the three objectives , these being convergence , regional competitiveness and employment , as well as European territorial cooperation .
Madam President , I would just like to ask Commissioner Kallas something for clarification .
It is quite extraordinary that we have to make use of instrumental crowbars in order to get a current issue into this honourable House .
Therefore , out of 433 programmes , there are only two , in Hungary , for which interim payments have been made .
First , however , we must create the many conditions we need to implement that .
No , this report is really about Turkey &apos;s membership bid .
I very much welcome the Commissioner &apos;s remarks and the fact that he says the Commission is doing everything possible to lessen the number of unsafe abortions taking place in the world , and indeed to reduce the need for abortions by giving and encouraging access to family planning and reproductive health matters .
I therefore voted for it .
Mr President , we have agreed between the groups that Amendment 4 by the ALDE Group does not fall even if Amendment 2 is adopted , because these are compatible amendments .
Allow me to draw your attention to the principal elements of the Commission &apos;s proposal to replace the framework directive of 1989 on materials and articles in contact with food .
The confidentiality of mail is one of the last bastions we have so far been able to protect .
In the report before us , an attempt is made yet again to sell immigration to us as a panacea , with Europe &apos;s hereditary population soon having to adapt to the migrants .
I fully respect the outcome of the Irish referendum .
I have every hope that the reinforced interinstitutional cooperation which has permitted a successful 1998 budget will again bear fruit for the next year .
It sets out a range of alternative scenarios if the review process is not completed by the end of 1998 .
The report specifically aims to establish adequate , sustainable and safe criteria , calling on Member States to debate the subject , to publicise the proposals formulated and to work together to produce a true joint plan through the Open Method of Coordination .
They obviously need to be given training so that they can work with the new technologies and that is something we have heavily emphasised in our resolution .
Such assessments are a good pretext for changing some of the terms of agreements which may prove to be inappropriate in terms of the local population or fish stocks in the area .
I cannot agree with the proposal to establish a separate programme on the monitoring of the internal market .
Madam President , I am going to put a different point of view .
That legislation has now been agreed and it ensures that we can encourage the vehicle manufacturers to move towards producing cleaner , greener and more efficient cars , but hopefully doing so in a sustainable way that will not cost jobs and prosperity in the industry .
I welcome a proposal for a directive to harmonize a number of things in this field .
I will of course emphasise the need to ensure that we have the necessary human resources available to spend those amounts in an appropriate and proper way .
I very much doubt that the ECHR will always pass neutral and appropriate judgments .
The golden rule , your golden rule , in other words , the automatic exchange of all fiscal , bank and financial data of all non @-@ residents , will inevitably lead to a flood of unmanageable data .
That will no longer be possible if we have EMU .
Mr President , the Chinese authorities are once again forcing us to express an opinion about a serious violation of human rights .
He also calls on the European Union to provide moral support for cooperation , which we will certainly not refuse him , and states that the European Union must hold constructive dialogue with all of Cuban society .
That is why we need a common strategic approach .
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Today , in Europe , we basically have two types of agriculture : the first is heavily subsidised and depends on support from the CAP . The second depends on the market and on the risks that farmers are forced to run in this market .
This has just been criticised by the European women &apos;s lobby in Parliament : there is talk of good practice and coordination , but we still have a long way to go
For example , what is the Presidency &apos;s view of the proposal to include the criterion of relative prosperity in the chapter on revenue ?
Research is one effective method of guaranteeing employment in the European Union in the long term .
The Union is right to send observers , but they must replace Russian peacekeepers , which will mean commitment from those Member States which are not already stretched militarily on other fronts .
It need not be 10 , but it may be 10 .
This means that the cost of road use is added to the total of costs borne by society such as environmental costs and the costs of accidents .
What quantitative data exist on the total or partial use of this fish meal in aquaculture ?
The European Union , while directing its attention to building common military instruments , such as Eurocorps , the European Air Transport Fleet and the permanent EU Operations Headquarters , must not , however , forget about other threats which are no less important .
Our committee is not opposed in principle to a new interinstitutional instrument , but it does ask for careful study of the guarantees and obligations implicit in such an instrument .
I only wonder what would induce a country that is setting up an illegal nuclear weapons programme to instruct a bunch of criminals to procure plutonium in the Central and Eastern European countries or the CIS states and then actually to smuggle it through a country like the Federal German Republic which has high @-@ level technical precautions at the airports , the ports and the borders , where there are authorities , where there are institutions that have the necessary technical equipment for checking whether someone has radioactive material , when at the same time a human life is only worth a few paltry dollars at the border between Afghanistan and Russia .
The Council accordingly is of the opinion that , if Iran continues its uranium enrichment activities , the Union will have no other alternative but to back talks on these sanctions .
Are we to build the European home on a distortion of history ?
Mr President , the Group of the Party of European Socialists welcomes the creation of a new regional fisheries organisation to govern the South @-@ East Atlantic , namely the South @-@ East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation ( SEAFO ) , and also the Community participation in this organisation .
Water is a vulnerable and invaluable natural resource .
In politics we very often overuse the word &apos; historic &apos; , but this is indeed a historic day for Croatia and this is an occasion which I know gives both Commissioner Verheugen and myself considerable personal pleasure .
Especially in a society where the application will be carried out by private companies whose objective is profit .
Sustainability must therefore be included right from the planning phase .
At the same time the EU would like to stress that national security legislation should not be applied in order to restrict human rights .
This seems ample time to me .
This is the content of our resolution , a text that I would like to comment on very briefly and in very simple terms , recalling Europe &apos;s responsibility in the Holocaust .
Priority in energy policy should be given to natural gas networks ; the most dangerous nuclear power stations should be closed immediately and it must above all be remembered that there are measurable nuclear problems in the Kola peninsula .
At the same time , Romania has supported the open @-@ door policy , aimed especially at strengthening NATO relations with Georgia and Ukraine .
It has been difficult though to identify civil society and human rights projects because of the weak capacity of local civil society and the fragile political situation .
While it is not possible to be in full agreement on all issues – friends very seldom are , and a sign of mature friendship is that they can differ even on significant issues – it is important that any differences that exist are managed in a way which avoids damaging the overall relationship .
I will end by saying to the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council that it should add two things to its list : we must defend the euro and we must work actively within the Doha Round , which is where globalisation is going to be debated this year .
I shall reply to the three questions from Mr Kreissl @-@ Dörfler .
Recommendation for second reading ( A5 @-@ 0206 / 2000 ) , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council regulation regarding the implementation of measures to promote economic and social development in Turkey &#91; 7492 / 1 / 2000 REV - C5 @-@ 0325 / 2000 - 1998 / 0300 ( COD ) &#93; ( Rapporteur : Mr Morillon )
We must also prevent the psychological factor of the visibility of national donations from disappearing completely , as a result of aid being provided at a more centralised level .
The crucial thing is not the type of work that will be done , but rather whether jobs will still be available in the future . The way I see it , some of the jobs of the future already exist .
It is clear that permanent officials are the mainstay of the Commission staff .
At a time when the electorate is being asked to place its trust in these institutions , we need at the same time to work to remove all the obstacles that still exist in terms of transparency and accessibility .
Today , I have heard some good and interesting suggestions , but the crucial point to understand is this : each of us must exercise his or her responsibilities coherently with the other institutions , while showing , of course , the greatest possible consideration for the European general interest .
A Union of 27 cannot operate with rules that were already restricting for the Fifteen .
A political analysis of the data shows , however , that Europeans recognise and thus complain to Community institutions while effectively bypassing national institutions .
For example , we now have the multi @-@ resistant salmonella DT104 in Denmark .
My group is in favour of deliberations that would culminate in the identification of the interests that are common to all European service users and of measures to guarantee the funding of the identified services .
The CFP is due for reform in 2002 and I hope , in the interests of French fishermen , that this resolution will not alter the views of the Commission and the Council .
The current accumulation of long- and short @-@ term challenges that the European Union is facing entails the adoption of the EU 2020 strategy so as to create a favourable framework for stable and sustainable economic growth and job creation in Europe .
I said that we had already pointed out , in a provisional communication with the Spanish authorities , that we did not think that the amendment was in accord with the directive .
( ES ) Madam President , talking about Tibet here today is a matter of justice and a matter of responsibility .
For us , CITES would be useful as a complement to CAMELAR .
They are talking about other issues .
It is not a debate for the EU as a separate multilateral entity .
( CS ) It is obvious that such a directive which is far @-@ reaching and which protects the fundamental values of the European Union is often viewed differently and is often exposed , for various reasons , to pressure for its effectiveness to be limited .
Whenever someone is given money , his human spirit becomes inventive .
Translated into concrete terms , this means the criteria that determine the absorption capacity of the Union .
Nonetheless , both for the CITES and the climate change negotiations , this did not prevent the EU from agreeing on a common line and carrying out a range of outreach activities towards its international partners .
