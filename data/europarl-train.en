That is why contradictions exist within the Dary report , which , on the one hand , advocates a global approach and support for fair trade bananas throughout the world , but , at the same time , continues to create difficulties of this kind for small producers in Latin America .
However , although tobacco was prohibited , alcohol failed to get sufficient votes .
Instead of a Commission proposal we have every country coming up with its own proposal , feeling forced to defend it in an intergovernmental logic and with no result in the end .
That is why this economic activity also has to be subject to boundaries .
This is why I yield willingly to this exercise .
. Mr President , the Horn of Africa is plagued by disastrous political failures , not just of the making of local powers , but also compounded by a series of misguided international actions and mostly inactions .
Once the day comes when these objectives have been achieved , the other inequalities will also have disappeared .
On the other hand , for their part , the elected representatives of the 11 other Member States who have been duly elected must not pay the price for such amateurishness .
in writing . - I abstained on the Eurovignette vote today .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
What did happen ?
We can only fear that this investment in time and resources by the Commission might be to the detriment of legislative activity , in which it holds the monopoly of initiative .
I agree with the rapporteur , Mr Cabrol , that the action programme on pollution @-@ related diseases has too many limitations .
( DE ) Today , I have voted against the Czech Republic &apos;s application for accession to the European Union .
Finally , with regard to our external relations . Around our borders we have relations with the Eastern European countries and with the former Soviet countries .
The criteria in the Treaty are clear enough .
Certain innovative measures contained in the Commission &apos;s proposals are in principle correct .
We wish your country all the best .
It has also been stated , however , that we ought to apply the strictest standards of all in the toy sector .
We do need to be careful however : our farmers must not end up working as underpaid landscape gardeners , leaving us dependent on imports of food and agricultural commodities from third countries , products subject to far less stringent requirements than those imposed on our farmers .
Mr President , I wish to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and the Commissioner for her interest and , indeed , involvement in this important issue .
Once POPs are released into the environment it is almost impossible to predict where they will end up , so we have to apply the precautionary principle , but most importantly take steps to restrict their use and their placing on the market generally .
That concludes the explanations of vote .
This is unjust and ineffective .
The era of cheap crude oil has gone .
I believe that it is only right that in documents designed to ensure the safety of motherhood , there should be references not only to these instruments but to other pro @-@ life instruments .
Formal adoption is yet to take place because of the parliamentary reservations of one State of the Union .
I have already explained this before .
Reports will be appearing this week in the media , or may already have appeared , on the subject of Europe - and not on the discharge or on the granting or postponement of the discharge .
As usual , the European Parliament is trying , however , to import other proposals aimed at increasing the EU &apos;s power in areas that should be reserved for the individual Member States .
We want you to take risks .
We can do it if we wish .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
The areas of general consensus are more important .
Let us give them the technology transfer that makes sense , before we say our markets are open to them .
These young , unemployed groups form in countries with high birth rates .
The principle of proportionality and the administrative burdens carried by farmers already must be taken into account in any new legislation .
Also of exceptional importance is the &apos; guaranteeing a decent pension &apos; initiative .
But we are prepared to consider that route , if it is clear that it would add to our effectiveness in helping the Iraqi people .
He may be interested to know that the Commission is engaged in activities in the area of health .
I give the floor to Mr Santer , President of the Commission .
Finally , I cannot omit to mention the inclusion of agriculture in this strategy because this was not envisaged in the initial proposal and it is , without doubt , an essential objective if Europe is to achieve its aims , whether from the point of view of economics , foodstuffs and the environment , or in terms of a greater quality of life for its rural zones , which will generate employment .
What is particularly important is that we use the successful launch of monetary union in order to reduce the democratic deficit in the European Union .
Perhaps Lyonnais cuisine is not to your taste , I would not know .
The Commission is particularly satisfied with the outcome of the meetings and events that took place in the context of the Madrid Summit .
They suggest that in some places it has been very difficult for them to go to school and that in some societies efforts have been made to establish schools that cater exclusively for the children of migrants .
As for the urgent provisions , it is content to request , in a very vague and allusive way , ‘ preventive measures to be taken to tackle the use of new generations of long @-@ residue neurotoxic products ’ .
Mr Commissioner , I am having some difficulty with what you are telling us .
That is obviously one of the questions on which the discussions will focus .
Much work has been completed with Member States &apos; experts and with wider stakeholders to turn the network into a successfully functioning reality .
This can at last put an end to the perpetuation of extreme poverty afflicting the Roma from generation to generation , it can make concerted efforts simultaneously in all related policy areas , and it will be able to intervene promptly in regions struggling with serious structural deficits and which are in the process of turning into ghettoes .
( PL ) Madam President , I am delighted that the European Parliament has supported the Committee on Agriculture &apos;s proposal , and especially the Polish Members &apos; amendment authorising the use of sales designations such as &apos; fruit wine &apos; , &apos; apple wine &apos; or &apos; currant wine &apos; .
Alright , let us adapt the Rules of Procedure , but we must respect them , because if we do not respect them today on the grounds that we think a Rule is nothing but an irritating bit of bureaucracy , then tomorrow others may take the same line and we will end up without any Rules at all .
Were they burnt to death ?
Mr Falconer , I will allow you to speak on condition that it is for a final point of order .
Objective 3 , meanwhile , is of a very different nature .
Europe is the only continent to have specific , ambitious legislation for reducing CO2 emissions .
The Union for Europe Group of the European Parliament wants to see an expansion of bottom @-@ up EU initiatives for both rural and urban schemes and not to dissipate these programmes in any shape or form .
The importance of the public funds pledged under the heading of cohesion policy demands the utmost vigilance given the potential for misappropriation of those funds .
. Madam President , I wish to thank the rapporteur for his work .
The objective of this report is to protect consumers but also to protect all companies operating in Europe that have not decided to outsource their business .
At the same time , I see no contradiction in organic producers underlining the region of origin of their own products if they wish to .
In my view , today the multilateral approach still deserves to take priority over regional initiatives .
The Commission has been asked to prepare an evaluation report on the matter for October .
This would be a great disappointment .
The next item is the recommendation for second reading on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , on Common Consular Instructions : biometric identifiers and visa applications ( 05329 / 1 / 2009 - C6 @-@ 0088 / 2009 - Rapporteur : Baroness Ludford .
Having invested a great deal of effort in this on behalf of my colleagues , I am fairly pleased with the outcome .
I have asked the Commission what scope the Structural Funds could offer Limburg at this stage .
I welcome the fact that both the Commission and the Council intend to give real consideration to this question on 26 and 27 September at the informal meeting of ministers of justice and of the interior .
If , during the hearings in Parliament , we are of the opinion that the allocation of the portfolios does not fully meet these objectives and we make proposals for changing the portfolios , are you prepared in principle to address our objections and to make changes ?
This has to be exercised complementing the activities carried out in the Member States - Article 164 of the EC Treaty - and always in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity - Article 5 of the EC Treaty - and respecting the national identities of its Member States - Article 6 of the EU Treaty .
by Mr P. Gaubert , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , on the proposal for a Council directive on a single application procedure for a single permit for third @-@ country nationals to reside and work in the territory of a Member State and on a common set of rights for third @-@ country workers legally residing in a Member State - C6 @-@ 0470 / 2007 - .
That is the due process , and no other process exists in a democracy under the rule of law .
Special attention should be given to last week &apos;s far @-@ right rally in Prague , which attempted to celebrate the 1938 anti @-@ Jewish purge known as the Kristallnacht on 9 November .
In fact , the Kingdom of Spain justifies its request on the basis of the principle that the economic and financial crisis caused a sudden collapse in the global economy , which had a serious knock @-@ on effect on numerous sectors , especially on demand in the construction sector and , hence , on timber products .
The opinions of the two committees consulted , the continuous activities of the delegations for South and Central America , the interparliamentary dialogue in the framework of the EP @-@ Latin American Parliament interparliamentary conferences all show how much importance we attach to the proposals set out in the resolution .
The purpose of these Regulations is to provide guarantees of origin for live cattle and meat from the farm to the consumer , thereby creating a sound basis for the presentation of beef and beef products in a manner that merits the confidence of consumers .
I am wearing my Bavarian national costume today and a good old Bavarian term comes to mind here : it is &apos; hinterfotzig &apos; and it means something like &apos; through the back door &apos; .
We should be supporting these forces in the hope that things in Haiti may take a turn for the better .
( The sitting was closed at 1.25 p.m. )
But it also shows that we still have a great deal of work to do .
We voted against the motion in the hope that an initiative might be produced by Parliament as a whole opposing emergency procedures and policies which undermine the fundamental principles of democracy and the rule of law , doing the terrorists &apos; work for them .
The Council in its many formations is still in the habit of preaching on Sundays and being content to let others , that is , Parliament , do the real work for the rest of the week .
The Commission &apos;s action plan is , however , somewhat disappointing as it is not an operational plan , but a strategic one .
Finally , I would like to underline the criteria that we applied for ensuring an allocation of staff which matches our policies .
The role given to Parliament should not be considered as strengthened : it is a requirement .
Does it listen to the people , does it respect their democratic wishes , or does it alienate its citizens by setting all of that aside ?
But if it is a question of a dominant company or monopoly abusing its position then that must be established .
Moreover , the US authorities want to pass that data to US surveillance networks .
19 .
Does he not think that in the last few days and weeks the economic positions of Member States have necessarily changed , and perhaps warrant an extra degree of flexibility ?
We , Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit – myself and other fellow Members – mentioned Resolution 1559 in March 2005 .
I have personally been at pains to supervise personally the smooth running of operations to assist the victims and the implementation of measures of all kinds adopted in this field , and to verify that all the institutions in the country are remaining mobilised for this purpose .
This is not therefore a valid argument for reducing aid to cotton .
The initiative should be welcomed if it provides added value to the already existing provisions of Article 26 of the Schengen implementing convention .
The European Parliament adds ideas of its own devising , such as the establishment of protected entry points for asylum seekers outside European Union territory , coupled with a ‘ resettlement scheme at Community level ’ , whereby refugees would be transferred from a first reception country to the European Union ( paragraph 13 ) .
In response to this imbalance , Europe needs to take different positions and look for new ways of working , because it is logical that , if the world has changed , we should change our working methods .
Given that illegal fishing has its biggest impact on those parts of the fleet operating on the high seas and on the continental shelf , especially in the least developed countries , cooperation among the Member States and among international fishing organisations is vital if this kind of fishing is to be combated .
The observers from these countries have done a fine piece of work in Parliament , but I hope that the new elections in June will ensure a more equal distribution of the sexes .
As I said before , this will have consequences of its own , because in principle it has nothing to do with the applicability of the Regulation on food and food additives .
Mindful of the difficulties that small and medium @-@ sized enterprises currently encounter when trying to access finances , the European Commission has closely followed developments in the sector , collaborating particularly with the European Central Bank with the aim of carrying out regular surveys of the situation .
On the contrary , we must use them to shape this critical dialogue .
The concrete recommendations for action in the Florenz report , such as support for the construction of zero energy , &apos; passive &apos; houses , the creation of a European fund to support research into renewable energy sources , linking up energy networks at European level and raising awareness among EU citizens and children in particular , all contribute to this shift in social attitude .
Yesterday , we achieved common positions on Kaliningrad , on the institutions , on certain calculation methods and , of course , also on the choice of countries .
For that reason , I believe the time has come to send a powerful political message to Turkey .
This was senseless and a terrible tragedy for his family , friends and colleagues from the church .
The whole experience was fantastic and left me with an urge to achieve something positive .
The role of the European Parliament , ladies and gentlemen , is not to become a chamber for settling the scores of national political rivals .
A great deal more is known about avian and human cases and about the transmission history of this swine influenza .
We destroy them at our peril ; we must defend rural society .
The situation has damaged not only the transport companies but also small and medium @-@ sized businesses and the hotel and catering facilities in the region .
Anyway , you saw what happened because it was reported in the press .
For this reason , prevention measures must be taken .
Funding should not be provided for the grubbing up of vineyards found to be in breach of the acquis .
I would also , of course , like to extend our thanks to our Secretary @-@ General , who has been a formidable negotiator on this topic - and without his determination , none of this would have been possible - and also to the four most recent Presidents of the European Parliament , Mr Pöttering , who was keen to complete this matter , Mr Borrell , who enabled us to take a decisive step forward with the adoption of the codex , Mr Cox , who made it possible to separate the various statutes , and , of course , Mrs Fontaine , who fired the starting pistol almost 10 years ago , so that we could finally have this report before us today .
The entire instability of the region is due to him .
He wants to be the creator .
To put this more clearly , measures are needed which will bring about a situation whereby a ban in one Member State would also be enforced in the country of residence and , by extension , everywhere that a driving licence is required in order to drive a vehicle .
Madam President , Madam Commissioner , if I had to tell my constituents that I was addressing the European Parliament at 11.30 p.m. , I doubt that they would believe me , let alone tell me that they tuned in to the new Europarl website to listen .
Of course , no one is contemplating opposition or hostility towards ? ? ? ? , but it only needs a minor disagreement for NATO to refuse its resources to the European forces .
Mr President , last week the European Court of Justice made a ruling that British prisoners should have the right to vote in elections .
The reversal of the burden of proof laid down in the directive will mean that it is possible to open legal proceedings on the basis of accusations not backed up by sufficient evidence .
I do not claim that these criteria , which we have been applying for a year and a half in a consistent , objective and impartial way to all disasters , are absolutely perfect .
Sweden is a nonaligned State and intends to remain so .
Together , not individually .
I think we are all in agreement on that .
- After the vote on the budget :
I can say that the right way to deal with this problem of the Ludwigia grandiflora , which is its Latin name , is to discuss this during the technical days which are being organised on 23 and 24 January . It is a conference for those who are concerned about these things .
I take the liberty of drawing attention to a further point .
It is really an issue for the Commission .
But let me make another suggestion .
It cannot be justified by talking about supposedly economic and fair grounds .
The first of these was raised in most of the speeches made .
That is very much the case .
Similarly housing , where single parent families , mainly women , face greater difficulties than men in renting accommodation and , of course , the insurance sector , mainly the car insurance , life assurance and pension sectors , as well as health insurance .
I would like you to cast your mind back to June when we set out the mental health pact for the European Union .
We must not be accomplices or casual observers of such barbarity .
Next , it must be performed by someone who believes in European integration .
The debate is closed .
Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit , thank you for your remarks .
That is where it leads .
I think the facts are there for all to see .
Despite agreeing that the modifications recommended by the Commission to the common agricultural policy are necessary , I feel that , with regard to milk quotas , the Commission proposal is very harmful to less competitive European regions which are heavily dependent on the milk sector .
Only on the basis of dialogue will the media and the Kenyan Government be able to develop a common understanding and build mutual respect .
For these reasons , I consented to and voted in favour of this report .
In that case , however , the Left should not go on about a united Europe : they are the only ones being hypocritical ; we on the right are certainly not !
EC @-@ Algeria Euro @-@ Mediterranean Agreement ( vote )
I have said on many occasions that I would like it to be ready by the end of this year , at the Nice summit .
Mr President , Mr Van Velzen has presented us with the Commission &apos;s proposal for a directive on the commercial exploitation of public sector documents , chiefly those of the European Parliament .
There is one thing that they are not suitable for , however , and that is sitting on .
That is why we should continue to help NGOs .
This is an important step towards increasing road safety and vehicle safety in the Community and towards making the internal market in motor vehicles a reality .
I voted in favour of this report .
It is time to realise that globalisation is not for tomorrow but today .
My group repeats our attachment to public services , an irreplaceable element in social cohesion and of balanced regional and rural planning .
But those of us who were involved in it knew there was no alternative , that the dairy problems had to be resolved , and hopefully we are now on the way to resolving some of the problems that part of the sector faced .
It is good for people as we approach maturity .
It is also true that problems identified in the report are at the frontier between territorial cohesion , on the one hand , and social cohesion challenges on the other , and social polarisation and social segregation problems , when concentrated on some territories , become territorial cohesion issues .
These findings confirm the results of earlier FVO missions .
This has to be the starting @-@ point for a rethink , and one might well be sparked off , and accompanied , by a European campaign .
I understand that concern , mentioned in the Commission &apos; s report , about the sustainability of inflation , but I would also like to provide some information which may clarify the situation .
I would like to emphasise four points from the document that emerged from that meeting , because some of them are important to the subsequent debate .
On the very same day on which the Commission qualifies Turkey as a constitutional state , the Austrian newspaper reports that 14 % of the asylum applications from Turkey are recognised , and as Reinhard Müller stated only two days ago in the , refugees are people who have fled their countries of origin out of reasonable fear of persecution .
The European Union has delivered on this commitment .
The first allowed the Commission to apply the competition rules in the air transport sector , imposing penalties and granting exemptions , but only in respect of traffic between Member States .
The adoption of a Code of Conduct within the EU is therefore a necessity .
. ( DA ) The European project began as a partnership between States .
I think that if we are to follow our Rules of Procedure , we must therefore place the report at the head of the agenda .
Since then , we have seen , especially in France , that Kosovo has become not just a route , but also a base for Islamic terrorists operating in Western Europe . These terrorists have been active in France and Germany in particular .
The cross stands for love triumphant .
Under Decree @-@ Law No 195 / 2009 , the Italian Government declared the crisis over and delegated responsibility for waste management to the provinces .
Please take along the results of the human rights dialogue and , furthermore , do it very publicly .
The World Bank , the OECD , the IMF and the WTO explain at length that lowering customs barriers means increasing living standards .
At present , security @-@ related issues are becoming a priority , and the proposal therefore also focuses on this area .
There are vast amounts of money laundering , enormous quantities of counterfeit goods and currency hitting us as well .
I hardly dare express the hope that our amendment , which proposes the participation of Parliament in this committee , will become a reality .
It is also important that they should do so in a way that is environmentally correct .
And what we have achieved , as has already been said , is not at all satisfactory either .
There is a need , therefore , for economic and political governance : the Central Bank can only be independent if a political government assumes responsibility for economic policy @-@ making .
In any case , I ask him humbly and modeslty to forgive me .
The more developed countries ’ inability to recycle has also produced paradoxical situations of economic dependence on certain resources .
We need to reinforce the synergies between our Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs and our climate and energy agenda .
With these , the Commission is finally implementing the decision of the Council and Parliament on the 2007 budget .
We are now facing the problem that the coffers are technically empty for this purpose , for these special delegates fall within the scope of the Council &apos;s budget .
I therefore consider that the adjustment needs to be made in this direction .
There is simply no justification for a Constitution ‘ worse than Nice ’ .
Otherwise time will run out and four or five Members will not receive replies to their questions .
The second element is that developing countries will contribute to the reduction in emissions within the framework of sustainable development .
( DA ) Mr President , I would actually like to talk about Mr Fjellner &apos;s report on establishing a European Medicines Agency , which contains a number of good and important initiatives .
At first reading , the Commission accepted in full , in part or in principle 46 of the 74 amendments tabled by the European Parliament , in that they clarified and improved the text , while remaining consistent with the format and approach of the original Commission proposal .
There is , however , a certain problem - the money provided from the European Union budget is often not enough on its own , and businesses are forced to invest huge amounts of their own resources .
Should more attention have been paid to certain isolated warnings which went against the tide of majority scientific opinion , according to which an effect on human health was extremely unlikely ?
We cannot use a one @-@ size @-@ fits @-@ all approach across the areas covered by the plan .
Finally , emphasis must be placed on the extent to which the development of new technologies is fundamental to ensuring the cataloguing , preservation and restoration of cinematographic works in order that they be of the highest quality .
We think that this will have a favourable impact , but we believe that we , ourselves , should make a greater effort to , for example , breathe new life into the jute organisation which died a death .
I warmly welcome the proposal and hope that the IGC is ready to make the necessary changes to the Treaties .
– Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , as was laid down in Zagreb and only very recently reconfirmed in Thessaloniki , each of the countries of South @-@ Eastern Europe has its own individual prospect for accession .
The European Union ’ s strategy consists of supporting the partners in their development efforts by helping them to enhance all the resources available to them , including tourism .
If the English believe that this remark is directed at them , they are not wrong , because we need to put a stop once and for all to a Europe which can be the victim of blackmail .
Therefore , we must work along these lines and accept that our policy will have certain effects .
But this does not only affect women who have been in the labour market for some time , but it also affects young women who are very well prepared , in many cases better prepared than men , who do brilliant work and who receive lower salaries than their male colleagues .
The Commission argues quite correctly that effective monitoring is only part of the overall picture and that the excess capacity in the Community fleets results in the problem I have just described .
Århus merely requires open access to administrative or , alternatively , judicial review proceedings ; Commissioner Wallström seeks to lay down binding provisions on access to the courts in all the Member States , with all environmental organisations to be empowered to object to administrative decisions and to appeal against them , with provision also for interim legal protection .
The listing of ingredients on labels must therefore comply with that directive .
In the past , I have even had the courage to impose a Europe tax on my country - specifically labelled a Europe tax - because I feel that the citizens have to be given clear , accurate information .
This will require the legislation to be restricted only to cross @-@ border cases .
I call on the Chinese authorities to accept possible contributions by ICOMOS , which has impressive experience in the management of urban historic landscapes , and I ask the Chinese Government to agree to lift Kashgar to UNESCO world heritage status that will include several cultural sites along the ancient Silk Road .
Hence our vote against the resolution .
From an economic point of view , then , a variety of approaches are possible , but there are good reasons why we , having established ourselves as a community and now being desirous of creating a single market , should equip ourselves with a Stability and Growth Pact of this kind , the most important of these being the introduction of the euro .
I voted for the 2009 Annual Statement on the Euro Area and Public Finances .
The legislation must also be respected and be designed in the way that is intended and not restricted through other methods .
There is no provision intended to deal with negative conflicts of jurisdiction .
All the NGOs must be eligible for financing regardless of their size , their experience and where in the Member States they are set up .
I agree that specialized treatment programmes for patients are needed to deal with Ecstasy but also with heroin use , whether people inject or they smoke ; and finally , intensified Gárdai action at known drug @-@ dealing locations is needed .
Nevertheless , there is still disagreement over the means , and the precise extent of this .
Now , however , we see that the situation in Turkey has developed in a very disappointing manner .
When they came to arrest me , there was no one left to speak up for me ’ .
These are questions that Members have already touched on .
What they demand of us is sensible and quick decisions .
By no means .
That was the case and continues to be so where other areas as well as the Structural Funds are concerned .
After all , the right balance should be struck between the free movement of services , respect for patients &apos; rights , the freedom of practising a medical profession in Europe and the freedom of establishment .
Four years on , not a single patient has received a single drug .
Is this , then , in some way , an entirely different and nobler goal ?
The international institutions should also be reviewed , including the Bretton Woods institutions such as the IMF , which has now been in existence for 54 years .
( DE ) Mr President , on behalf of my group , the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left , I would like to make clear at this point that we are deeply concerned about the development of EU foreign policy towards militarisation and an increasingly interventionist policy .
You have inherited this dossier from your predecessors .
The Kurdish problem is not a police problem
To name certain cases , I would remind you that , since the new Pact was approved last year , the excessive deficit procedure has been applied to Italy , Portugal , Hungary , the United Kingdom and Germany , with unanimity in the Council and without the problems of political acceptance which arose during the previous stage .
We criticised the Treaty of Nice because we considered that the voting procedure in the Council was not adequate for an enlarged Union , and that must have been clear to our Polish friends from the outset , Mr Verheugen .
The delay in the arrival of the aid promised by the European Union , despite the promises made by the Council and the Commission , is unacceptable .
Our concerns deal mainly with organised crime , prostitution and trafficking in human beings , drugs and weapons , and I believe the new Kosovar authorities must increase their efforts to control these practices .
The report of the UN special envoy Mrs Anna Kajumulo will be available through the usual United Nations sources , I am reliably informed .
Mr President , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , France has decided that its Presidency will be synonymous with political commitment .
Here , I would like to remind everyone of what the Executive Director of Frontex , Ilkka Laitinen , said at the last meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs ( JHA ) Council : he said that migration flows are already demonstrably changing , away from the southern border across the Mediterranean and towards the eastern border .
The committee held several interesting exchanges and I have endeavoured to incorporate all these points of view in the formulation of this report .
The thrust of my report is that the textiles industry is really just the tip of the iceberg .
Combating cigarette smuggling ( EC @-@ Philip Morris agreement ) ( debate )
It is always being said that competition law is at the heart of the European treaties , but – as has already been lamented – it does lay considerable burdens on the executive .
The committee first discussed whether it should send a recommendation back to the Commission with the words &apos; to be revised &apos; .
The European Union &apos;s potential and strength in a solution to this crisis lies in the fact that the Union is a credible player in the eyes of all parties .
Thus , operating under the conditions and the rules of the free market and liberalisation , the aerospace industry in Europe is in danger of shrinking as the result of competition from mainly American companies .
Climate change
But Greece &apos;s entire economic policy is already being drawn up on the basis of the assumption that there will be a large budgetary surplus rather than equilibrium , as you said , and that unemployment will fall . At the same time , there are absolutely no data concerning Greece in all the statistics on the Union .
Mr Martens has the floor now .
We would like to see the situation in Turkey drastically improve in terms of democratisation and human rights and in terms of a solution to the Kurdish issue , but we hope that this is possible without having to exert financial pressure .
Nobody can deny that the right to security is a fundamental right .
I speak for many who were there when I say that we felt the European spirit among us .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , as we know , this is a democratic institution , and from time to time we need to apply the rules of democracy .
Let us now defend justice , the law and , above all , the resolutions voted for by the United Nations , and the documents which have been signed by common agreement by the parties present .
Allow me , as an MEP from eastern Germany , to conclude by observing that I find it insufferable , 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall , that Europe is coming more and more to resemble a fortress .
I note with satisfaction that , in interviews , he adduces Parliament as what one might call an argument , along the lines of : if the Council will not come to an agreement , then the decision on the budget will have to pass to Parliament .
I hope that we shall reject the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market because they break with the tradition of a Parliament - as Mrs Fraisse quite rightly said - which has , until now , defended diversity in cultural production in Europe and the specific , and indeed exceptional role , of creative artists , writers and artists in European civilisation .
Perhaps it was not like the situation in Malta , where I understand the situation is particularly difficult , but I think everybody in the EU has some experience of that and , without a doubt , there is a need for us to work together .
In my opinion , therefore , the Union &apos;s priority should first of all be to achieve the 20 @-@ 20 @-@ 20 targets set by the Climate and Energy Package , which are already very ambitious .
Therefore we , as a Commission , will monitor development in this field very closely and we will have a review of the targets in 2013 .
That is why it is so important that we stop this practice .
This is a very fast @-@ moving market , and so we need fast decision @-@ making processes that produce binding rulings and , above all , more legal security as well .
Mr President , this is wrong : you give the floor to someone who was supposed to speak in favour of the proposal , and here he is speaking against it .
Their adoption is particularly unwise , since it rejects the national taxation of European Parliament salaries and fails to put the travel scheme in order .
More often than not , they were healthier before the doctor was called than after .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - ( PT ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I tried very briefly in my speech to give this House detailed and comprehensive information on all the political and diplomatic measures being taken and contacts being made in relation to the Burma ( Myanmar ) issue , on how we have been monitoring the situation and on what we have done .
I voted for this report because , by setting medium- and long @-@ term goals , it takes a realistic approach to a problem originating in the imbalance between countries that are developed and those that are not , as well as in human rights violations in many parts of the world .
I do not accept that the purpose of a common defence policy is to protect the Union &apos;s interests in all areas , including security of supply .
Of course , we have warned repeatedly that the Member States will not achieve the target of a 12 % share for renewable energy by 2010 .
I would therefore ask for the opinion of Mr Dell &apos;Alba .
As this concerns a moral responsibility , however , we believe that personal off @-@ set has been too little mentioned in the report .
The vote will take place at 12 noon on Thursday .
Today the Danish Social Democrats voted in favour of a report on the need to adopt common rules in addition to the Geneva Convention .
It states that the Stability and Growth Pact should , in quite simple words , be &apos; retained &apos; .
It is difficult to imagine achieving greater coherence in the European Union &apos; s policies without the Development Council playing a more active and interventionist role in relation to political decisions , which clearly come under the development banner and which are being dealt with in other Councils , in other decision @-@ making forums , ranging from the Agriculture and Fisheries Councils to the Environment Council . Up to now , the Development Council has not had any opportunity to make its voice heard or to intervene in relation to these decisions .
Many congratulations to you .
In doing this , we will purely and simply be barking up the wrong tree .
Tackling the subject of fuel standards should provide the opportunity for being much more vigorous in introducing specifications in favour of bio @-@ fuels . Indeed , the fuels we manufacture from agricultural produce cannot be faulted in terms of the greenhouse effect , make a major contribution to Europe &apos; s self @-@ sufficiency in energy and constitute a very important outlet for a number of our agricultural products .
At long last , a constructive , truly expedient measure at Community level .
Agricultural policy must respond to European and global challenges , particularly when we take into account the fact that , according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation , food production has to increase by at least 70 % to meet the needs of a world population which , by 2050 , is set to exceed 9 billion .
I am voting for this proposal .
In rural areas , including large parts of my own constituency of the West Midlands , the percentage could be higher still .
It is we politicians who must take responsibility for giving out political messages and political information , something that obviously applies both to choosing the points at issue and setting them out before people .
With more people in work there will be more support available for those who are not .
I have a suggestion : instead of asking the governments , ask the abused women concerned : for example , women who have been abused and taken refuge in shelters for women should be asked about the help they have received and the attitude of authorities to their cases in general , or girls and women suffering on the streets of Budapest or , say , Amsterdam , and who are hoping to escape from the hell of prostitution , should be asked about the type of help they have received from their state or government .
In short , we need to establish a single legal framework that brings together all the Community regulations on fisheries and that includes all the measures on modernising and renewing fleets , joint ventures , processing and marketing , socio @-@ economic measures , aquaculture , etcetera . In short , we need measures that enable the fleet to maintain its competitiveness in an open global market .
I quite understand , moreover , your concern for greater coherence with the competition policy for which Commissioner Monti is responsible .
What tangible contribution would the new Constitutional Treaty make to the fight against drug use in sport ?
Russian troops not only entered the territory of South Ossetia , but advanced further into the country itself .
General Motors , where last year more than 500 000 employees were affected by restructuring , is one such example that is of concern to us today .
Migration is a particularly relevant issue which has been highlighted recently , because due to events in North Africa , the European Union , as a neighbouring region , has been forced to receive huge flows of migrants .
And thirdly , what authority does the European Banking Authority have to impose its authority on errant banks , banks that are over @-@ exposed , banks behaving recklessly , and so on ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , what is the context in which we are considering the Sindal Report ?
For this reason , it is imperative that environmental policy remains a top priority for the EU and individual Member States .
In the current post @-@ Irish referendum climate , how does Council envisage processing applications such as these ?
We can conduct a market surveillance , we have controls and our Rapex system , which is a system through which we can get information through the market and not only when the dangerous goods are stopped at our borders .
The Commission is absolutely committed to fulfilling its responsibility and providing high @-@ quality responses to parliamentary questions .
Perhaps I should say , rather , that they would not be addressing the problem flexibly or satisfactorily .
In the second instance , I fully understand your sympathy for the two neighbouring countries of Tunisia and Morocco , especially as we already answered a similar question , among others that you raised some months ago .
Experience with development shows that if conditionality is imposed it is never effective .
In addition , the European Union must demand that the Turkish government maintains a dialogue with the Kurds , a dialogue which resolves the Kurdish claims for autonomy within Turkey , as well as respect for democratic rights .
It is therefore of major importance that allowance be made in social legislation for the fact that Sundays are to be maintained as days of rest within the European Union .
It is quite clear that a body of intellectual property law which protects computer software by copyright , and leaves patents for other purposes , works well from the point of view of the software industry , and of the creative minds which develop computer software .
I hope that , in the near future , we can count upon a proposal by the Commission on chemicals policy .
I know , Mrs Fraga Estévez , that you approve and will support this amendment .
This proposal is a sledgehammer to crack a nut and , just like the port services directive , it should be disposed of into the waste bin .
The regulation under consideration today , purged of certain incongruities that shocked even the most inattentive reader , takes account of a series of factors that are essential in order to obtain good results from population and housing censuses and will enable us to have pre @-@ defined reference years common to the Member States and listed questions that will allow reliable comparisons .
The representatives of civil society have set great store by this .
It is not like that .
It must exist , because its voice contributes to maintaining pluralism along with television generally , but it must exist within a system where the public service mission is clearly defined .
Madam High Representative , in my view , the hardest thing of all will be to formulate a holistic approach , but that is precisely what we need to do .
If Europe and European industry do not have full access to the market developing there then we will not be able to have the leading industry in the world .
Furthermore , the regulation of production is a slow process because it takes around two years before cows are ready for production .
This will increase regional prosperity and stability .
It stresses the importance of maintaining quality public services , a solid public and universal social security system and high levels of social protection and quality employment combined with rights and of ensuring effective gender mainstreaming in the formulation and implementation of such public policies ; finally , it urges the Commission and the Member States to give maximum priority to women &apos;s social integration and women &apos;s rights , by altering their respective policies accordingly , including income distribution policy .
The question is whether our financial sector is equipped to cope with severe weather .
That enlargement is of tremendous significance , not just in a symbolic sense but in a very real sense as well .
If there is deemed to be no risk related to internal security and illegal immigration , and traffic at a border is of such intensity that waiting times become excessive , then the need to take fingerprints may be waived .
I would also like to think that there could be an extension to this time limit in case of difficulties with any one particular product .
We want to clearly express that we are tough on the regime , but we try to assist the people .
It is an extremely dangerous situation that we have here .
In other words : must a state that was once a beneficiary always remain a beneficiary ?
Having seen one of their positions on a rejected amendment , they voted against the whole text without having warned us beforehand about the importance they attached to that point .
This brings me to the fourth and last key message of this Annual Report .
Naturally , my Committee has examined this issue and concludes that the right legal basis has been selected and that the concerns regarding the proposal &apos;s legality are unfounded .
Some have become a sort of political conscience - and I am thinking here particularly of Greenpeace or the WWF - and so carry out a public function .
We have just held the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty on 17 October and the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion will soon draw to a close , but what will we have to show for this ?
Lastly I urge the Commission to concentrate on revising directive 90 / 220 to make procedures more transparent , both for the consumer and the industries concerned .
The Council is aware of the possibilities offered by the OSCE &apos;s Moscow mechanism .
Although some Members may have doubts , now of all times we must work hard for Community values , such as strengthening the rule of law , fighting corruption and stressing the importance of independent social debate in Russia itself .
Excessive regulation means less competitiveness , while excessive inflexibility means less efficient operation .
Thus , to grant legal powers to this Commission , on the subject of which the Court of Auditors , in its Special Report No 1 of 2005 , notes that respect for the fundamental rights of persons subject to an inquiry is not guaranteed , means running the risk of creating , at the Berlaymont , a little centre in which people ’ s liberties are infringed , a kind of regulatory mini @-@ Guantanamo .
I would like to make it abundantly clear that I believe that the Bosnian Muslims are Europeans , that the Muslim Albanians are Europeans , and that our Muslim fellow @-@ citizens of the EU are Europeans , but that , to take one example , the Christian Ethiopians are not .
The vote will take place on Tuesday .
There will never be stability , however , without strong economic growth .
The Council has already made progress in this direction by adopting , with the exception of the United Kingdom and Sweden , a proposed exchange @-@ rate mechanism based on the EMS .
The main section relates to transport .
This will be the largest contribution to date by any donor to Vietnam .
There is one further problem in particular , namely the growing tendency to separate information from commentary .
- Report : Staes
We want to do what we see as our duty to our electorate .
I am sure this would be the best way to boost our common efforts for a truly common foreign and security policy .
As a member of the Committee on Petitions , like you , Mr President , I have worked very closely with Mr Söderman .
The new EGTCs will serve to enforce legislation in Member States , generate new dynamics in cross @-@ border cooperation , and enable a higher degree of confidence and cooperation to be maintained beyond the limits of borders .
I have run out of time now and will say the rest when we vote .
As the European Environment Agency has recommended , we need to use economic devices such as ecotaxes and introduce the notion of third @-@ party liability for industries , otherwise we shall never succeed in finding a solution to our problems .
I must also of course welcome the progress made in relation to the possibility of the free movement of Serbian nationals within the European space .
&#91; 5178 / 1 / 2001 - C5 @-@ 0075 / 2001 - 2000 / 0066 ( COD ) &#93; ( Rapporteur : Mr Ortuondo Larrea )
I fear that unless there is a spectacular turn @-@ around at the European summit in Brussels in March 1999 , the European elections will be spoiled by a confrontation between national self @-@ interests .
In the Netherlands , for example , an asylum @-@ seeker whose application has been turned down cannot appeal to a higher authority .
President @-@ in @-@ Office , I welcome the fact that you referred to the different dimensions of sport .
So , finally , a party whose Turkish name translates as the &apos; Democratic Society Party &apos; is gone , but its aim of a democratic society in a modern Turkey must not be lost .
I think that when we embark on a process of creating new agencies - and I believe that several dozen agencies are now being thought of to create programmes on a similar scale - I think that before embarking on this process , we ought to think very carefully about the problems we want to resolve , if an agency is indeed to be different and will resolve issues that these scientific and technical offices have not been able to resolve .
If Mr Westerwelle is the obstacle , then tell us that it is Mr Westerwelle : at least that way , we will know what is shaping different Member States &apos; policy .
The adoption of measures aimed simply at reducing fisheries activity without taking this balance into account could , strangely enough , have a negative impact because , for example , if we do not continue to fish for species which are predators , those fish which are consumed by the predators will become less and less common .
I find it difficult to accept any remark that the Commission is tolerating the situation and not doing its job as Guardian of the Treaties .
As an exception , and with the forbearance of all those present , I therefore allow you to continue for a further 15 seconds .
Mrs Hieronymi made it very clear - and , as a member of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , I can only underline what she said - that a unitary standard for digital television , and its interoperability , are issues not only for industry policy , but also for consumers .
In this new context , while the EU remains the first commercial power in the world and the US continues to be the first commercial partner of the EU , our cooperation is much more than that : it is a core element of the international system as it is based on common values , historic ties and strategic interests , which is not always the case for other strategic partners .
The Turkish Government &apos;s large parliamentary majority means reform cannot be delayed .
It may be that the American system of justice is no longer even able or willing to protect the human dignity and basic rights of its own President , according to the latest developments .
The Council decided to create the most dynamic economic area in the world .
The debate is closed .
However , by the same token , it is important for the European Union to give greater support to its own ports to counter unfair competition from third @-@ country ports .
For example , the French company managed by Michel Adrien from the Vendée region , which laid the foundations for the European turbot industry , had to invest FRF 2.5 million each year for ten years in pure research before it succeeded in mastering the technique for reproducing turbot in captivity .
( PL ) Mr President , the former President of Côte d &apos;Ivoire , Laurent Gbagbo , is said to have indicated yesterday he is ready to surrender and to have asked the United Nations for protection .
We will have to define that concept . Perhaps it is at this summit in Washington that the green light can be given to that examination .
That is out of the question in a political democracy .
Furthermore , these agreements completely contradict the Kyoto Protocol and its objectives on global warming .
Finally , I would like to provide an explanation for the text included in paragraph 2 ( i ) , namely that information and consultation of employees must be carried out , with due regard for the principles of confidentiality of the information .
We are , of course , in the position of having had resources as a result of the fact that plenty of money was allocated to agriculture to start with within the multiannual financial framework .
In my opinion , it is very understandable and natural that that should be the case .
That is why the European Parliament has drawn up a list of conditions , which have already been outlined : from the time @-@ limited mandate to precise definitions of targets and tasks , the proper preparation and technical equipment for EUFOR troops , and the granting of an operational mandate including an exit strategy .
Thank you for your time .
The debate is closed .
We should finally be totally realistic and pragmatic .
We must respond to these worries together .
Mr President , I think that today we have seen how without the EU we should have not reached this binding agreement .
Mr President , I would like to stress that , by approving the Council &apos; s common position on electronic commerce tomorrow , this House will be showing a very great degree of political responsibility of great institutional significance .
I would like to thank the Commission for having taken on the Spanish Presidency &apos;s initiative and for having come out and said , &apos; OK , we will act quicker than that , we will put forward the proposal next week &apos; .
You can do better .
Certainly not individually ; probably not as Europe .
International pressure must be brought to bear on both sides to bring about a new cease @-@ fire for a start .
. Madam President , seeing as the summit will be held in Vienna , I should like to say a few words in German : I am delighted at the very broad agreement reached between the three institutions of the European Union regarding the Latin America summit and the issue of Latin America .
Certainly , this has to do with the complicated procedure , but it is interesting that three Member States who have not managed it are some of the founding Member States .
Firstly the sulphur content of fuels used in machinery would be reduced to 350 mg per kilogram and then by 2009 the sulphur content would be eliminated totally .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , I would like to join previous speakers in expressing my group &apos; s solidarity with the families , the victims &apos; relatives and the people of Toulouse as a whole .
In any case , the Commission thinks that it is important to reiterate that the ambassadors would always act on a volunteer basis and the views that they would convey would be their own views .
In the light of the tragedy affecting this profession , what are we proposing to these men , these regions , these villages , these local economies ?
11 .
I will try to deal as directly as possible with the seven questions raised by Mr Brok .
These agreements guarantee that interest received and paid to EU citizens in these third countries is liable either to income tax in their own Member State or to deduction at source .
I have chosen a path , a path of equal protection under the law , a path to pursue justice , encourage and engage , a path to do good .
If enlargement means we get a transport system that is a little fairer and also friendlier to the environment , it will meet with greater acceptance .
Development aid must be linked to the creation of conditions for developing trade .
We are engaged in progressively implementing both .
If , for example , you do not want the Poles , Czechs and Slovaks to be disappointed in their hopes that this Europe would actually bring them social progress , or if you do not want Europe to be associated , in the West , only with social decline , then you cannot vote in favour of the Bolkestein directive as it stands .
This report portrays that picture very clearly .
I believe that within this context , there is a role for the Generalised System of Preferences , which allows developed countries to offer preferential and non @-@ reciprocal treatment on products imported from developing countries .
That is of fundamental importance to us .
Thirdly , I should say for the benefit of the rapporteur , Mrs Kestelijn @-@ Sierens , that we have taken numerous initiatives involving potential new Member States of the Union , and with great success .
I believe that this principle was never questioned by you , even during your time as President .
It is not surprising that the EU may stand accused of being unable to say &apos; no &apos; to anyone when it sets its sights so low .
That is what the European public wants .
I will state openly that most applications of genetic technology and biotechnology throw up no fundamental ethical problems , and so biotechnology should be supported , and , in that we save resources by its astute use , biotechnology can also make a contribution towards sustainable development .
Solidarity , which has often been referred to today , also involves solidarity with the citizens in our own home countries .
Secondly , Recommendation No 23 , with which we call for an extension of responsibility to the guarantee system .
The Commission is caught up in the role of a Molière character , who is asked to eat well with little money .
Because when huge efforts have been required of the applicant countries for years , it would be a fateful sign if the EU were simply not to hand in its homework .
Moreover , it should also be stated clearly in the regulation itself that it is the Director of OLAF who decides whether or not to open an investigation , that it is the discretionary principle that applies .
Ladies and gentlemen , I will contact both the Court of Auditors and the Council today .
Perhaps I shall not need all this time .
I have no great difficulty in principle with what Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten says .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the forthcoming Euromed Ministerial Conference is without doubt important , complex and a matter of urgency in view of the tragedies we are witnessing in our seas on a daily basis .
The effect of these legal changes should , however , be subsequently monitored .
The Commission can accept in full all the amendments of the PPE @-@ DE / PSE / ALDE compromise package on registration , including the amendment on OSOR ; these are amendments 367 to 413 ( inclusive ) .
The reasons is that I should prefer to act in full knowledge of the facts .
The position adopted by the rapporteur and then by the Commission was , in my view , far too lenient , bearing in mind the dangers associated with chemicals .
The consequences of the cynical attitude of a dictatorship , which had a nuclear power station which was unsafe from the outset and four reactors which were shut down in December in response to international pressure , have had to be borne mainly by the people in the countries affected .
However , I cannot accept certain amendments that could limit the development of joint actions between the programmes and with other Community actions .
I believe that the necessary transformation of energy and transport systems in our part of the world should become an important lever in the Lisbon Process and should be able to create some impetus for creating new jobs and export opportunities .
Given that this is a newly established institution , we are prepared to accept this particular budget as it is .
In the Council &apos;s vision , it has been reduced to an information booth , but I take the same view as the rapporteur , who believes that it is crucial for the desired flow of goods .
I would like to add that , when we tackled the subject of codecision , we perhaps did not get it quite right , but I would like to assure Mrs Izquierdo that the spirit embodied in the wording of this text was neither restrictive nor risky .
The next item is the report by Jelko Kacin , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation ( EC ) No 2667 / 2000 on the European Agency for Reconstruction - C6 @-@ 0170 / 2006 - .
I say this with all the respect that I have had for the work that you have done in recent years : we are arguing here about what is the right position to take and it is cowardly on your part - just because your Group has stabbed you in the back , and all over a subtly different position that also states that we need troops , but we need to do it properly - to simply duck your head and say that you are withdrawing your name .
The outcome is not exactly what we would have wanted .
Following this debate , I have to observe , however , that the men who participated put forward some antediluvian views .
The Presidency is independently preparing a comprehensive report on questions to be examined at the IGC and on the various options for resolving them .
Does the Commission regard these shifts and agreements amongst undertakings as running counter to the spirit and the letter of the Treaties and as detrimental to free competition and to the consumer ?
Like many of my colleagues , I fear that such a catalogue of competences would prove too rigid a system in a world where change is the only permanent factor .
Particular attention should be paid to border protection so as to prevent an uncontrolled invasion by the hundreds of thousands of immigrants who are about to flood into our countries as a result of the political situation in North Africa .
I , too , am astonished that the Council is proposing over EUR 1 billion of cuts to payments for the programmes aimed at improving European competitiveness and cohesion .
When is the Commission planning to present the reviewed text of the EIA Directive ?
The sanctions should therefore be reviewed and analysed : both the concept itself and its application .
The second key message from the Annual Growth Survey is to push forward with structural reforms so that we can create new job opportunities .
We note its request for urgency and will be pushing this morning within the committee I have the honour to chair to make a recommendation to Parliament this afternoon to adopt those proposals .
However , we also expect there to be greater awareness and appreciation of the peculiarities , differences , varying situations and traditions of the fishing industries , and that they will not be disregarded , penalised or even eliminated due to the misinterpretation of the concept of harmonisation of fisheries policies , as has sometimes occurred in the past .
We have had very positive contributions from both the Council and the Commission .
However , we disagree with the Council &apos;s proposals for cuts that will affect the internal market .
Subject : East Timor Will the Commission state what action it intends to take on behalf of the European Union with regard to East Timor ?
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - ( HU ) Small and medium @-@ sized enterprises are vital actors in the European economy .
There are four or five of them for each of the three Transcaucasian countries .
One criterion was that we wanted the political force that is the second @-@ strongest force in Europe to be represented on a higher level in this Commission .
The Commission should therefore act as an ice @-@ breaker .
Once and for all , we have to create incentives to do such things as getting traffic off the roads and onto rails , using preferential treatment , rewards , and also sanctions , although it is the sanctions that this House never wants .
Proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and the Council establishing the European Refugee Fund for the period 2007 @-@ 2013 as part of the general programme &apos; Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows &apos; - C6 @-@ 0238 / 2005 -
As a parallel exercise , we have launched SEM 2000 , the aim of which is to overhaul our general administrative culture and turn ourselves into a fitter and more modern institution .
These allegations must be determined , and Europe must show determination that they should .
These issues are particularly important to the residents of border regions , who have cultural and family ties ( ... )
The European Union - and we in this House in particular - have made an essential contribution to getting these talks off the ground again and to getting what is termed the Peking Agreement with concrete measures put in place .
The summit outcome is a success for the EU and it bears the ‘ made in Europe ’ stamp .
In the European Union , however , herbal medicinal products are not yet regulated on a uniform basis .
And , thirdly , we disagree with it because the Commission proposal advocates , looking forward to the fifth framework programme , a vertical philosophy that will increase the research disparities which exist in Europe , given that some countries devote 0.5 % of GDP to research , whilst others dedicate 2.7 % .
Mr President , right at the outset I would like to say to Mr Helmer and others that people on this side of the House are not in the business of shackling or hampering the decision @-@ making capabilities of businesses .
Entry into force requires ratification by 55 parties representing at least 55 % of the CO2 emissions in 1990 of the industrialised countries .
The actors involved in development cooperation as well as the international press have to be guaranteed access to Tibet .
Mr President , it is no coincidence that my colleague , Mr Bushill @-@ Matthews , and myself have asked to speak in this debate .
There were peaceful protests in all parts of the EU .
We must also ensure that the benefits of these new technologies are accessible to all , avoiding the creation of a digital divide , and , in particular , supporting Internet connections for all European schools by the end of 2001 , as decided .
It does not exist in respect of other producers .
The vote will take place on Thursday .
The cultural and creative industries are crucial for European citizens because of their economic and cultural nature .
Competition is a war which has major concerns fighting each other , which constantly takes the form of layoffs , factory closures , not to mention extensive waste of production capacity .
These include a proposal to include a species of true mahogany in the list in Appendix II and proposals on the improvement of CITES &apos; working methods .
We must demonstrate our support through deeds .
Mr President , what was the European Union ’ s and Parliament ’ s response to this situation ?
These are intelligent and reasonable suggestions .
The death penalty equates to murder , and even if a murderer is killed under the death penalty , this is still murder .
Madam President , I would like to ask my colleagues in the PPE Group and the ELDR Group if they intend to maintain their motion for a resolution , which contains flagrant untruths .
I shall not dwell on this further because I have already highlighted in my introduction the increasingly important role which the Union plays and is expected to play in the international arena .
I must , however , express some concerns that I fear may not have been given due consideration .
Above all , I find it rather selective .
It is unacceptable to refuse to appoint a woman to a job who is pregnant and is due to go on maternity leave .
It damages the front against Burma for us to find fragmentary action of that kind being taken , which damages the European Union and is not part of a consolidated , agreed international package of action against a particular country which we have profound disagreements with .
We are therefore convinced about establishing communities of innovation and knowledge as strategic integrated networks of universities , research centres and businesses , in which students , researchers and knowledge could circulate freely and where work could be carried out on areas of maximum scientific and strategic interest , such as renewable energy or information and communication technologies .
The three people with him at the time of his abduction were killed by the kidnappers .
Since 1980 we have been talking about two peoples and two States : one State exists , but the other does not .
The resolution takes it for granted that shareholder revenue should be protected rather than safeguarding workers &apos; wages .
I think Parliament will increase its stature by taking up this case by a majority .
This signing does not mean that the Albanian Government , which has presented the concluding of this agreement as an important victory , can rest on its laurels , and I hope that people in Albania are aware of this .
Under Milosevic ?
It seems a parody of a policy and yet it is the policy of the Italian Government .
What the Patent Directive means , as the Scandinavian Association against Painful Animal Tests has pointed out , is that a company can gain a monopoly over important genes which could create difficulties for the discovery of new drugs .
Amendment No 1 refers to one recital which , in our view , does not reflect properly the variation in surveillance capacity in the Member States .
These and other measures are being examined in the context of the high @-@ level group on textiles and clothing .
As a result , what we now ask the Presidency – whilst congratulating it on its determination and whilst telling it that we want a compromise and that we are here to help it reach that compromise – is to reach a compromise that is closer to what Parliament will , I hope , vote for tomorrow , and also closer to the Commission ’ s proposal than to that from certain Member States , even though we recognise that they do have real difficulties that we must not underestimate .
Yet now all that has been forgotten .
The wind of change from the new countries will be an inspiration for the old Union , not a threat .
I now expect the Tibetan refugee centre and the Dalai Lama ’ s office in Kathmandu to be reopened .
The Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities unanimously condemns the delay on the part of the Commission , which is even more serious given that it extends from 1992 to 2000 , which is the period in which there have been the most changes in terms of women &apos; s access to work .
Listening to the debate on these issues , you often get the feeling that every country has the world ’ s best education system .
Can I therefore conclude that until the setting up of the committee of inquiry the Commission never , at any time , collectively - and here of course I mean principally you and the other Commissioners - came to any political understanding of what it would mean if we extended this system ?
The clear apportionment of responsibility has been central .
It has done much to improve and clarify the text of the directive .
The Chair must be absolutely neutral when it comes to a vote , up to the point that , in general , it does not even cast its own vote .
These measures require great sacrifices from families and businesses .
We need to improve the implementation of Community policy .
This could prevent economic integration being driven solely by the markets without any account being taken of employment policy and social issues .
A great deal has been said about whether military airbases should or should not fall within the scope of the directive .
The measures we propose include measures to promote better compliance with driving and resting periods in freight and bus transport .
The whole question of the impact assessment is a difficult one , and one that I did have something to say about .
On the pretext of creating a single operating framework and providing better port services , the private sector is being paid to take over a sector which is still being run as a public utility .
I am pleased that so many of our requirements have been included in the final report by the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , Minister , first I would like to thank Mr Tannock and Mr Obiols for presenting the report and , without further ado , to inform you that my group is critical of the evolution and approach taken in the neighbourhood policy .
Under your presidency the European Council nominated a candidate for the post of President of the Commission in the space of one hour , a process that dragged on over more than two summit conferences five years ago .
With the forthcoming enlargement , there is now an overlap between the European Union and the Council of Europe , and I think we need to think about transforming the Council of Europe into a Universal Council of Democracies into which we could integrate countries like Canada , the United States , Japan and South Korea and have them genuinely spearhead a campaign to affirm democracy throughout the world , beginning with the battles for the abolition of the death penalty and for the International Criminal Court .
I think that if Gothenburg can demonstrate that , then it will show people that the European project is worth fighting for .
( Applause from the ARE Group )
This concerns the same report that Mrs Buitenweg touched on .
Mr President , today in this House we have an illustration of the deficiency in the current procedures , with a motion of censure being necessary to try to extract information sufficient to meet suspicions about potential conflicts of interest .
So I will repeat what I said earlier , that is that operators are bound , as of 1 November , to label products which are not equivalent within the meaning of article 2 of Regulation 1813 / 97 / EEC .
Sibel has been exploited by ruthless criminals for their drugs trade and now faces years of hell .
We are back to televisions and television programmes - this certainly is the day for telecommunications !
in writing . - ( PT ) It is true that the long @-@ term consequences of GMO technology are still unknown .
This is not the time nor place to go into that .
There was talk of money laundering , bribery , betting and tax fraud , amongst others practices .
Mr President , Commissioner Wallström , I believe that the speeches by my fellow Members , especially those from my group but also from others , have pinpointed the fundamental problem that we have in this report .
In particular , it is not Europe &apos;s role to decree , on the basis of scientific studies , which are only of value until the next studies that contradict them , that smoking cannabis is a good thing .
I am glad to report that the Scotch Whisky Association has reached a consensual settlement of that difficult question for the time being .
Jan Andersson has submitted an outstanding report . It was quite rightly adopted unanimously by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
Such a situation would result in substantial revenue loss for present Member States , especially those having borders with candidate countries .
Article 181a would be the most logical option : economic , financial and technical cooperation with third countries .
What do we do with those countries ?
Should this not be the case , the Commission will take the appropriate measures .
Immorality rules in this Parliament .
We are taking numerous steps in this direction .
Ladies and gentlemen , thank you .
With regard to financing , the Council takes the view that the establishment of an effective post @-@ 2010 policy framework and the introduction of a new strategic plan for the CBD will require appropriate mobilisation of resources from all possible sources , covering both public and private finance , and including new forms of financing and financing for measures to combat climate change .
And yet now - not only in past history , but even today - there are still conflicts happening in the name of religion .
In conclusion , the Commission can accept the first part of Amendment 1 and Amendments 6 , 14 and 21 .
My fourth point is in relation to our procedures .
The text represents a well @-@ balanced compromise that will enable the Community to resume the combat against violence for another five years with reasonable financial resources .
The government has acknowledged the problems and stressed that it intends to continue its efforts along these lines but I believe that parliament has also set limits on the potential for this particular government to intervene .
On the other hand , I fear that the statements made by President Barroso and confirmed today by the Ecofin Council which , in principle , recommend controlling the budgets , will lead to a reduction in the spending allocated to low @-@ cost housing offices and , in particular , to social housing .
It is right to draw this to the attention of people .
( The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m. )
And we should also recognise the courage of the British Prime Minister , Mr Tony Blair , at that time .
We cannot simply shell out money with no timetable .
I think we have added another few elements to the rights of passengers .
The EU will continue to deal with the issue of the mandate , with the aim of commencing talks as soon as possible .
We cannot deal with this matter with this sort of technocracy and without a sensitive reply by the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council and I call for a material response .
I think it would be worth trying to get private capital interested in investing in these public projects . They cover all areas from transport to energy .
Although we are making the budget for 1997 a zero growth budget , therefore , we also wish to maintain our priorities : increased support for the peace process in Northern Ireland and research and technological development , and additional funds for the trans @-@ European networks of some ECU 100 million .
For us , these are the conditions for a successful reform of the Treaties .
I admire everything but his taste in football clubs .
firstly , to increase to EUR 260 per tonne the lump sum of EUR 237 per tonne which the producers will receive .
An international Charter of Fundamental Rights for Internet users is needed .
This is particularly the case in relation to Article 13 and Article 13 ( 2 ) primarily serving the first and Article 13 ( 5 ) the second aim .
We should respect both approaches because both countries are trying just as hard .
– Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to add my warm congratulations to Mr Ó Neachtain .
We do not , however , endorse the idea of giving countries outside the region the status of ENP countries .
Mr President , this report tries to put our minds at rest about the service but , to my mind , it does exactly the opposite .
Therefore , once we have assessed the potential radiation threat to Europe , here in the European Parliament we should discuss the risk of nuclear power plants near the European Union &apos;s external borders .
However , even though everyone sees the need for it , the actual completion of such a project is not an easy thing .
I consider this a good report on the whole , but there is one point with which I am not in agreement – and this will not surprise you .
The Conference of Donors , which Chris Patten will refer to , may work and may be a considerable help from an economic point of view .
These legal proceedings against a former head of government are classical preventive human rights policy .
There must be a moratorium on the enlargement process at this stage .
I do not recommend fighting fire with fire in this circumstance .
Reaching agreement on this issue would have been much more beneficial to each party concerned than continuing the legal wrangling .
The European Parliament is happy to support you in this venture .
I should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made , ladies and gentlemen , and firstly on procedure .
In addition the introduction of information technology has led to the restructuring of job descriptions : many jobs have gone and some middle @-@ aged people have had to give up work .
We are in agreement on that .
I also wish to tell you that there has been some progress on urban @-@ related issues in the negotiations as well .
I am , therefore , appealing publicly to the sense of responsibility of the members of my group and asking them to withdraw their signatures from a completely foolish political document .
An interesting foretaste of the new , larger ESCB was provided by the General Council meeting last week where , for the first time , the governors of the acceding countries &apos; central banks participated as observers in a meeting of the General Council of the ECB .
We would ask that someone who carries political responsibility at a certain level would issue a statement of assurance annually .
&apos;The contribution that an organised and living Europe can bring to civilisation is indispensable to the maintenance of peaceful relations &apos; , Schuman declared in 1950 , saying : &apos; world peace cannot be safeguarded without the making of creative efforts proportionate to the dangers that threaten it &apos; .
The outcome of the Convention will be presented in the form of options , which should reassure all those who felt that their hand was being forced .
The package that should correct and prevent imbalances and asymmetries is based on an imbalance and a lack of symmetry .
Every ethical and legal safeguard must be put in place so that the essential rights and values of our society are preserved at all times , but we have no right to paralyse scientific progress when it is helping people fulfil their destiny as human beings .
A voluntary policy of this kind at national level should have the specific aim of ensuring that the Roma population really does have access to education , jobs , healthcare and housing , and it is quite clear that coordination between the Member States of the Union is absolutely crucial and important .
Yet I am of the view that there is a significant contradiction between health policy ( for which very little EU money is available ) and the promotion of tobacco growing , which , moreover , is of very poor quality in Europe .
We shall now suspend the sitting .
Unless we signal a new beginning in this way , we shall ultimately lose all our credibility .
We nonetheless share the concerns expressed by members of our Group regarding certain aspects of this report , including the following :
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the cane @-@ sugar rum sector provides almost 40 000 jobs in three of the four French overseas departments .
However , he does have some legal reservations about the applicability of the enhanced cooperation procedure in this specific case .
Mr President , Commissioner , the European Food Authority is of fundamental importance to the people in our Community .
Despite the recommendations of the Council of Europe , the resolutions of the European Council and the European Parliament , all based on fundamental principles affirmed in international documents and agreements , despite the militant commitment of women &apos;s associations , and the decisions taken on equality mechanisms by our countries , ministries and committees , the use of the female body to sell consumer goods , that stereotype of the presumed traditional role of women , continues to infest the walls of our cities , television broadcasts at every hour of the day , and the pages of newspapers and magazines .
Like the harvest report that has been presented , the Ministry &apos;s official figures also confirm that the drought has brought on extreme losses to the harvest in Germany , but also in its European neighbours , and you have already pointed out that the European Commission has taken initial steps to enable the direct payments that are in any case due to farmers to be made more speedily and at an earlier date .
Let us be vigilant towards Turkey therefore .
As they deal with the same subject , Questions No 31 and 32 will be taken together .
Parliament and the Commission must support each other .
I should like to point out that the Union supports regional cooperation initiatives in Europe .
To turn to the subject of the European Police College , which was created as a result of the Council decision of 22 December 2000 , to which the European Parliament also contributed in the form of Mr Posselt &apos; s report - I would like to say that in terms of its organisation , the College &apos; s rules of procedure will be submitted for the Council &apos; s information .
If it had been decided to introduce a new financial framework , there would have been a danger of this too proving expensive for the Member States .
I asked the question because there is a certain sensitivity in France to this issue .
Industry representatives have been widely consulted and are in favour of the proposed regulatory framework .
Please , Commissioner , can you give me some reassurance on that front ?
recourse by workers to private insurance ( &apos; individualisation &apos; in the euro @-@ unifying terminology ) , the so @-@ called &apos; third pillar &apos; .
I really do hope that Greece and Italy , in whose programme there is no mention of the Northern Dimension at all , will also take the Northern Dimension into consideration .
Does Sarajevo still need the High Representative ?
If the Americans were not waging war on Afghanistan , then the detainees have simply been kidnapped .
However , this cannot be compared with the disappointment felt by the people of Kenya themselves , people who took part in the elections en masse in the hope of a better future .
It was negotiated and we have an intergovernmental treaty that recognises this .
( PL ) Mr President , thank you very much for the opportunity to take the floor .
This is all well and good for other countries , but the United States does not feel like adhering to these .
in writing . - I vote against the Motion for Resolution on the consequences of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon for ongoing interinstitutional decision @-@ making procedures as it includes the regulation about the so called &quot; direct trade ” between the EU and the occupied part of the Republic of Cyprus .
( PL ) Mr President , at the last session I was not allowed to speak , and I am therefore protesting today , in the European Parliament , at an infringement of human rights and an assault on the dignity of the individual .
It does not amount to much compared to the USD 60 million devoted this year alone by President Lukashenko to widespread propaganda , indoctrination and government media .
Using the Islamic terror group Laskar Jihad as a front , thousands of these fighters , some of them foreign , recently arrived on the island of Sulawesi .
The Member States spend public money on schools , health care , research , infrastructure and support for vulnerable groups in society , while most of the EU &apos;s expenditure goes on a lunatic agricultural policy , misdirected Structural Funds and the financing of EU institutions that should have been closed down a long time ago .
Employment policy is surely linked to liberalization policy , though , and the Commission is the standard @-@ bearer of liberalization in Europe , not without good reason .
And , Madam President , that is the aim of our amendment : to promote and develop the use of and communication in their own languages , by European citizens , respecting their own cultures and idiosyncrasies , with the Community institutions , in this case with the European Parliament .
If the country says &apos; yes &apos; it will be possible .
Once again these crimes are being committed with the unspoken blessing of the United States and the European Union , despite anguished appeals from President Arafat .
In Africa , we are seeking partnership with the sub @-@ regional organisations SADC , IGAD and ECOWAS , which also work on conflict prevention and crisis management , in order to help them build up their capabilities and support local processes .
The aim should then be to include them in the partnership agreements that are to be established with each Member State .
The debate is closed .
Thousands of years of Chinese culture can give it the strength to do so .
Mr President , we can give our assent to this report by Mr Martin for a number of reasons , but chiefly because it introduces the new descriptive term &apos; ultra @-@ peripherality &apos; for the extremely remote regions and calls for additional new measures over and above the support provided through the ordinary regional policy and , even , through the special programmes of additional measures .
Article 12 of the structural funds regulation adopted on 21 June 1999 provides for the possibility of sanctions in the event of violations in the following areas : implementation of environmental legislation , breaches of public contracts and failure to observe equality between men and women .
On your other remark , Commissioner , according to figures from InfoPoint Brussels , there are approximately 25 % more EU publications in old Member State languages than publications in the new Member State languages .
I believe that the European Union and Japan should contribute towards the successful conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda negotiations .
The Community provides an added value in combating trafficking in women and children , the abuse of children and paedophilia , and this is important when the European Union has to act not only in the context of cooperation under the third pillar , but also in collaboration with NGOs .
Nevertheless , despite all the problems that entailed , the Agency has done some very good functional work , which I would particularly like to acknowledge here .
A diplomatic initiative on the part of the Commission and the Austrian Presidency of the Council helped to put a speedy end to this situation .
They must put forward a common strategy which recognises and responds to the clearly established demands of our European citizens for action against drugs and crime .
( Loud applause )
We do not have access to the financial resources that are necessary to combat this crisis .
Considerable intervention is required now from the European Union before the onset of winter so as not to allow any chance for the anti @-@ European forces to take advantage of the difficult situation the Republic of Moldova is currently in .
I have heard you say that the reform , or deepening , of the European institutions is necessary in order to make a success of enlargement .
However , we have to be realistic and we should take the improvements that are now on offer .
We have to live with this , and with its financial consequences , which are not so great , and which are certainly justified by avoiding unhealthy centralisation in Brussels , as is unfortunately practised by a good third of the present Members of the European Parliament .
In addition , measurable macro @-@ economic criteria and reforms in the recipient country are crucial .
Mr President , there are four basic reasons why the text as adjusted by the Council is not acceptable , in my view .
I would ask the House - notwithstanding the intervention of Mr Poettering - not to reopen the debate .
That is why we are recommending that the Council or relevant permanent representation should also be represented at our meetings so that they develop a greater understanding of the problems citizens face and respond effectively .
Madam President , we need to reject this proposal from the Commission for three clear reasons .
The credibility of the solution at this point in time , according to this scenario , is very low .
The poorest in Zimbabwe do not want to shoot , kill , loot and burn crops .
They hummed and hawed as if this European educational area did not yet exist .
It is in our interest , not to say our supreme interest , to give due consideration to all the relevant circumstances surrounding this sensitive issue , including the geographical location of individual countries .
So we have to get this package of measures right .
And they are institutions , not institutions .
Are we talking about the distribution and sourcing of water ?
I assume you have already had an opportunity to read this document , so I need only mention the most important points here .
We trust that these proposals will be put into practice across the board .
We have to take more action and act more effectively .
Empathy is the key word .
We could , however , expect one or two things from the skipper , namely , initiative and ideas , and we are still waiting .
In so doing , he violated all the rules of honesty , trust and collegiality .
In the fourth place , training is important where changing the organization of work is concerned .
I hope that the impetus given to the interinstitutional dialogue can continue both in the work of the Commission and in the work of the new Presidency .
Information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products (
I too believe that future cooperation between the European Union and the world &apos;s emerging economies should not be based exclusively on the purely economics @-@ based definition of this concept that has prevailed up to now .
It has no economic basis , as Mr Bangemann rightly pointed out .
The European Parliament must , at last , designate energy projects which are important for its security and the ways in which they will be funded .
I also agree with the rapporteur on broadening the scope of the European Maritime Safety Agency , to allow it to fulfil its task of inspection and following up the present regulation .
I believe this statement should answer Parliament &apos;s question and indicate the Commission &apos;s willingness to make use of Article 141 in a general positive action .
This is a truly important step because enterprises will be granted the automatic right to demand the payment of overdue interest and also obtain a fixed minimum amount of EUR 40 as compensation for the costs of recovering the debt .
Finally on foreign policy , where the US seems to wish to continue its ideas for action against Iraq , this is seen by many as not perhaps the best way to deal with that problem .
It is impossible to stop a revolution with clever word games and little schemes behind the scenes .
We want the benefits and we want them now .
Once again , I should like to thank Members for their thoughtful and incisive contributions .
Mr President , the figures displaced persons have risen dramatically in recent years .
Recently , there has been a major shortcoming on an essential issue , from the point of view of the dignity of Members .
Of course , this issue should be put in the context of the comprehensive response .
It seems strange to me that she was imprisoned on her way here because she represents the South East of England and was arrested five or six hundred miles further north .
To give them what all the human rights declarations in the world , including the European declarations , fail to recognise as an individual right ?
When human rights are repressed , regardless of where in the world it takes place , we can never , ever compromise .
The modifications that they propose relate to policy areas that are not covered by the Commission ’ s competition policy .
Such an approach will undermine the Union &apos;s political credibility .
This report was voted on under Rule 110a of the Rules of Procedure , which allows for no debate and no amendments to the report .
This is the aim of the motion for a resolution we are to adopt today .
What is more , you are very much aware of the fact that companies have long borne the costs of congestion , as it leads to higher wage costs and higher fuel costs .
- ( DA ) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of the Watson report .
I fear that this is being exploited by our trading partners in order to exert greater pressure on the European Commission .
Back in my region - and by the way , Robert Evans , the United Kingdom is now producing cars close to its historic high level and we have more car producers making cars in the United Kingdom than any other European Union country , so please do not run down our car industry - on my local motorway , we have Britain &apos;s first intelligent highway which opens lanes and controls speeds according to the traffic flow , and I can tell you that not only does traffic flow more smoothly , but fuel consumption has also been improved : it is a win @-@ win @-@ win situation .
The Laeken Declaration &apos; s objective of good governance , that is connecting better with citizens , reducing bureaucracy and delivering on our objectives more effectively and efficiently , cannot wait .
It is vital , however , that we do not defend such an absolute and modern view of our position on certain values that our focus on a single part obscures the bigger picture .
I was in the Rocky Mountain Institute in a snow storm , with very little heating equipment in use and looking at and admiring the banana trees .
The Commission was requested to embark on the preparation of a composite paper on enlargement . And the Commission was requested to deepen its evaluation of the effects of enlargement on the common policies and to undertake a detailed analysis of the Union &apos;s financing system post @-@ 1999 .
Dear honoured guests , dear colleagues , dear friends , there are days when I am particularly proud to sit in the chair of the European Parliament as President .
We have before us today a Commission communication on the action plan against racism .
The dead in Iraq , in Afghanistan and in the former Yugoslavia have certainly tested this .
This , however , is not enough to significantly improve the situation in this sphere .
( FR ) Mr President , my first words will be to commend the work of our rapporteur , Mrs Podimata , as well as the tremendous amount of work carried out by Mrs Hübner on behalf of our political group .
It will not be an umpteenth rehash of fine words as a policy mix or a revamp of social security , served up with a dash of Luxembourg sauce , that gives the European Union a decent policy on jobs .
One right which EU consumers are entitled to is that of food security and safety .
Therefore , I fully agree with the rapporteur that the &apos; present report constitutes a further step of a continuous effort .
It is perhaps Parliament &apos; s role to ask for more .
But it also creates a gap : N + 2 leaves two years between commitment and payment .
One definite step was the Council &apos;s acceptance of a revised generalised scheme of preferences - the social incentive system - which provides for additional preferences for countries which adhere to core labour norms .
It is natural for these countries to object , as they are currently benefiting from tax competition .
Thus the report sets out a number of specific points , some very specific indeed , which the Commission can improve within the context of its market access strategy .
It is in favour of the further development of launching systems , the development of new telecommunications systems and further European participation in the Alpha station programme and reiterates the European Parliament &apos; s support for the development of the global satellite navigation system known as Galileo .
It also safeguards the existence of a Community regime coordinating the social insurance systems .
However , I would draw your attention to the fact that , despite the number of good projects to which additional aid is to be allocated , some important projects are missing from this dossier .
Unless the European Union is prepared to take clear initiatives to revitalize these talks , we risk jeopardizing the whole process .
The Commission is fully committed to transparency principles and supports the publication of a call for expression of interest in the Official Journal , as was also mentioned by Mr Martin .
Finally , Europe has developed a cooperation policy with all the countries in the Middle East in a bid to create the right conditions for harmonious economic and social development and , at the same time , strengthen regional integration , which is crucial if peace is to gain a permanent foothold .
Of course , the Commission is happy to read in your follow @-@ up report that you are pleased to have received all the documents requested in the discharge resolution .
In the Commission , it is more complex .
That is not what it is about .
The allocation of EU funds to projects in the field of energy is a good stimulus for the heads of EU governments , local authorities and businesses .
I would just like to highlight a few points that strike me as particularly important .
All extremist groups are prohibited .
Portugal , like the country I know best - or used to know best - has done its own best to discharge the responsibilities bequeathed by history honourably and well .
In the Commission &apos;s view these measures , together with the above support programme , suffice to maintain the dynamism of the sector .
We must be consistent here .
However , such a dialogue should be clearly distinguished from any attempts to coordinate policies ex ante , so as to achieve a certain &quot; policy mix &quot; , which would blur the fundamental responsibilities I described .
The phasing out of assistance to parts of these regions is worrying and unclear .
Investors must know that the same standards apply throughout the world .
Mr President , as a Member of the European Parliament for Wales , I have a lot of sympathy for the many minority languages across Europe , particularly as my mother tongue is Welsh , one of the oldest European languages still in use .
If we , the United States and Europe , manage to set common standards , then those common standards will sooner or later become world standards .
This text confirms all of the reservations towards the European liberal model held by the social movements , including the European Trade Union Confederation – and with good reason .
Unfortunately , however , the spirit and letter of the text remain faithful to disastrous neoliberal policies which work to the detriment of the workers , lead to recession and unemployment and are exacerbating the crisis .
I think it makes a great deal of sense to debate priorities intensively first , before getting down to specific numbers . More importantly , I think it is most helpful to present the preliminary draft budget so early , thereby allowing time for intensive discussion .
It is crucial for the Republic of Moldova to continue with the implementation of the ENP Action Plan and the reforms it has set out in the document &apos; Rethink Moldova &apos; .
This will lead to chaos .
I would refer here to the exchange @-@ rate turbulence experienced in recent years .
It sets out clearly which organizations should be supported , and it respects the need of those organizations to determine their own priorities and activities independently .
A few decades ago the people still lived relatively well .
Flags of convenience are a blight on the system .
If we have to have some difficult debates , for God &apos;s sake , let us have them in September and let us have it out in September so that we do not have some form of institutional guerilla warfare right through to December or January .
I am aware , having discussed this with Mr Böge too , how important this debate is in Parliament , and also how important it is for the French Presidency .
They must finally be recognised as partners .
The question we address is what the political profile of our relations should be 10 years after the signature of the 1995 New Transatlantic Agenda and fifteen years after the 1990 Transatlantic Declaration .
Returning to the astuteness of the rapporteur and those who conducted and closely followed the interinstitutional proceedings , the second reading will also enable us to go a little further with consumer guarantees and protection , particularly in the area of child protection , outlawing the unfair exploitation of children through a number of duly considered and polished amendments , for which the final agreement of the Council is already assured .
I would like to make it clear to the honourable Member that it is not me who carries out leaks , I can guarantee that .
Firstly , we need to promote the independence of island systems in the European Union .
For this reason , and in spite of certain reservations , I voted in favour of the proposal for a directive .
. Mr President , I should like to repeat that in the deliberations of the Council ’ s ad hoc group on the Stability and Growth Pact , the Commission actively supported a number of the amendments tabled by Parliament at first reading .
Madam President , you have followed the rapporteur &apos;s proposal and put the first item to the vote .
Those are two words : &apos; candid &apos; and &apos; friend &apos; ; so let me be a candid friend to Israel first of all .
I voted for the amendments and for those parts of the text that relate to taxing financial transactions .
One particularly tragic aspect of this was that those people who were particularly hard hit by the Iron Curtain were the same people who had suffered most under National Socialism .
Pilots , technicians and other professionals have irreplaceable experience in this field .
It also raises the 40 % escape rate objective .
We started off with Article 95 as legal base and we have moved on to Article 308 because it suited certain people .
I would like some clarification : Does one need to remain in the chamber if one wishes to submit a written explanation and have it approved , or not ?
And you know that in this field there is much that needs to be done .
As regards our emerging strategic partners around the globe , we have witnessed recently how culture can become an integral part of our external relations .
Europe must also spend its money more effectively .
This is why I hope that tomorrow , Parliament will agree to vote in favour of the principle of increased resources for the Eurogroup .
Unfortunately Europe &apos;s contribution is often unremarked in these situations , and we have to have a visible presence on the ground and show our solidarity , not just in the military campaign but also in the humanitarian effort .
The debate is closed .
Let us just consider : in a few weeks the third phase of European economic and monetary union begins , which will lead to a domestic market , the formal external appearance of which will be the single currency .
Other actors are trying to get seats on that board , so there is some pressure .
What measures does it intend to implement to protect income aid for farmers under the CAP and shield such aid from fraudulent practices which tarnish the sector &apos; s image and undermine its impact ?
Through the rapid mobilisation of ECHO &apos;s emergency response system and the EU civil protection mechanism , we were able to offer coordinated and practical help soon after the earthquake struck .
We have a great need of transparency , in view of recent cases such as the , and cases .
Mr President , free movement of workers is one of the four freedoms granted in the Treaty of Rome .
Madam President , President Prodi said &apos; Public opinion is not sufficiently convinced &apos; and other Members have said the same thing .
For this reason , we believe that group actions are necessary and welcome in a form efficient for the consumer and balanced for the market .
Unfortunately , few observers are aware of the heterogeneous nature of the community of senior citizens .
A rapid response agency for dealing with emergencies would make the European Union &apos;s interventions in the event of natural or accidental disasters much more coherent and effective .
I am voting against the report .
I should like to finish by saying that it is a job well done by the UN today , and I think it will add credibility to its stance on human rights issues .
Mr President , I rise on a point of order , the number of which will be familiar to your aides , about supplementary questions following a debate .
&apos;Do not go where the path may lead . Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail &apos; .
The Prime Minister understands that , but I am not sure that many other Member State governments do .
I myself have worked long and hard on this regulation .
On 6 July 2010 , Parliament adopted , by a large majority , resolution P7 _ TA ( 2010 ) 0264 , on the Commission &apos;s Green Paper on the management of bio @-@ waste in the European Union , urging the Commission to draw up a proposal for a specific directive on bio @-@ waste by the end of 2010 .
Do you also not consider , Mr Byrne , that taking dead animals and sick animals is not good enough and that you will only get a proper overview , i.e. carry out proper screening , by testing one animal in every five , six or ten thousand to be slaughtered , depending on the BSE status of the Member State ?
We must have the courage to draw the necessary conclusions and ensure that the burden of recovery is apportioned fairly .
Is it not high time that the Member States put themselves in a position to respond to that challenge with a radical , yet responsible , revision of their views on what is supposed to be a comprehensive package on a common - and I repeat , common - migration policy ?
On the other hand , it would be very regrettable if we could not tidy up our regulation on this point when there have been so many problems in the past .
But neither , as everyone is well aware , is there a political solution that could be imposed on the states of the region .
We also urge greater openness and flexibility so that resources from the solidarity fund can be used to minimise the damage to production capacity in a large number of regions and to remedy the most serious cases in Portugal and Spain .
. ( PT ) I wish to make a brief comment to explain how our vote on this report clearly confirms that we are in no way opposed to the European Research Area , to extending and developing it or to the Sixth Framework Programme in general .
On the pretext of the ageing population , it is promoting an increase in the retirement age , an extension of working life , cutbacks in pensions , the dissociation of pensions and wages and increased financial contributions by workers .
Like the rapporteur , we must first deplore the way the Commission keeps insisting on resorting to the use of instruments that are not legally enforceable , when , in our view , in areas such as the organisation of work , workers &apos; individual and collective rights and social measures regulating the free @-@ market economy , rules should continue to take the form of directives .
Mr President , Mrs Cederschiöld , the provisions of the internal market do not preclude Member States from exercising domestic controls .
Mr President , talking about food is not very easy these days . If we then turn to purely technical aspects such as those addressed by Mr Lannoye , the complications increase .
Europe must not hesitate to deploy all its diplomatic and economic resources to achieve this .
At the same time , we recognise that the proposal has a number of weak points and gaps , which the rapporteur has detected and seeks to correct through a number of amendments , all of which we find both rational and fair .
Madam President , I strongly deplore the killing of 10 African Union peacekeepers on 30 September 2007 by unidentified forces in Haskanita in south Darfur .
We voted yes to Amendments 10 and 12 , as they reject the militarisation of the EU . We too oppose the militarisation of the EU .
It accumulates in our bodies and poisons us .
The employment rate among women is less than 25 % , way below the 55 % in the European Union .
– Mr President , whilst I share the criticisms of the decision taken by the Council of Ministers as regards the ten new countries ’ accession , we must also ask whether the Council of Ministers of Culture still takes decisions by unanimity .
Then we will be able to take decisions in this field .
Third , there is the issue of the implementation of a refund system , as a practical tool for differentiating duties for commercial and non @-@ commercial diesel .
Imagine if all the other reports from Parliament had to be debated again because Mrs Auken had not taken part in the committee reading .
My second point is that it must be a developmental budget , not one that will fund micro @-@ programmes and modest priorities .
In connection with Russia , the same themes appear over and over again on the agenda , whatever the Committee concerned and irrespective of whether it is a question of the fight against crime , economic reforms or sensible legislation in Russia concerning , for example , banking or taxes . And nowhere can any effective progress be seen .
There is also a need for a new directive on disability rights which would guarantee that people who suffer from conditions of this kind are not discriminated against in accessing jobs .
It is , however , important to emphasise that European industry must keep up its efforts to modernise , by investing in innovation and in improving quality in order to increase its competitiveness in the sector around the world .
Under the Lisbon Treaty , Member States &apos; parliaments will not be able to block the further extension of Europol &apos;s powers , amended by Council decisions .
In short , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen : once they have got through the door into Italy , thanks to Schengen you will find all kinds , genuine ones and unwelcome ones , in your own countries .
This reduction in expenditure complies with the policy of thrift , and the Budget Committee has backed it .
When the Budgetary Control Committee interviewed Mr Wessberg on 24 May 2011 , MEPs praised his past performance in both the private and public sectors .
The European Union is the world &apos;s biggest provider of development aid and the United Nations &apos; main partner in supporting the latter &apos;s efforts in carrying out its activities .
I feel that we have been through several rounds of a boxing match but ultimately the whole committee , including the rapporteur , said that discharge should be granted .
I was very pleased to learn that Mr Carlos Coelho had expressed his support for this proposal from the very beginning and the rapporteur , together with the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs , has understood that action needs to be taken in order to facilitate the life of third @-@ country nationals , because we want to encourage people legally residing in our area .

I should like to mention a very personal recollection from my youth , when I was at university : Professor Cariota @-@ Ferrara , who had done his thesis on inheritance law , used to say that inheritance law was a law about emotions , a law that often involved suffering .
I expect political thuggery , which aims to replace dialogue , to be universally condemned by those involved in politics .
We have learned that in ‘ customer to customer ’ services in particular – that is , business to consumer and business to business – the Internet opens up totally new opportunities .
Before drafting the proposal for a regulation on accompanying measures for Sugar Protocol countries , the Commission had produced an action plan setting out the principles of its proposed support for the Sugar Protocol countries .
We are abused and accused - this is the second time that I have been the focus of such treatment by the Dutch Press .
I should like to confine myself today to just one issue that the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council has not mentioned .
I believe that the European Commission should have a rethink on the process of introducing the euro and should prepare a clear strategy for its introduction which does not indirectly induce Member States to cause harm to themselves or their neighbours .
The former report received unanimous support in the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
I would prefer to abstain from the vote on the motion for a resolution on an EC @-@ Turkmenistan trade agreement .
We all know that Europe is already experiencing a &apos; demographic winter &apos; and urgently requires manpower from non @-@ member countries .
Europe &apos;s energy security is based on a variety of sources , routes and supply countries .
The common position contains a considerable number of qualitative improvements introduced as a result of amendments proposed by Parliament .
Mr President , according to the agenda , we were due to have a debate on the situation in the Middle East and yet , apart from Mrs Kuntz ’ s speech , only Palestine has been discussed .
This concept of outermost regions was introduced into the EU ’ s primary law in Article 299 ( 2 ) of the Treaty , and constitutes the legal basis for the Council to adopt specific measures applicable to the outermost regions , acting on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting Parliament .
Political systems are developed through dialogue and the actions of men and women , and those same men and women are fully accountable for what is said and done .
The report deals with the major trends in women &apos;s health .
The Commission aims to launch this programme , as the rapporteur explained , at the beginning of 2005 , nearly halfway to the target year for the Lisbon Agenda : 2010 .
The next item is the report ( A4 @-@ 0216 / 99 ) by Mr Fayot , on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities , on the modification of Annex V of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament .
The Commissioner spoke of the need for a proactive movement towards the provision of services , but we cannot all cut each other ’ s hair ; on the contrary , we also have to produce something .
Madam President , free movement of persons is one of the Union &apos;s most important objectives .
Mr President , as this report rightly observes , next year is an election year and our electorates will be asked once again to vote for their MEPs .
As for being ponderous , ladies and gentlemen , I might be inclined to overlook the remark , since my weight makes it impossible for me to deny the Commissioner &apos;s charge .
That is why , Mr Rehn , I am a little concerned for your future , because I am not entirely sure how you are going to be able to find a portfolio within the future Commission that is more attractive than that of enlargement .
I do not know what one has got to do with the other , apart perhaps from the fact that Mr Knolle felt compelled to tell us a little of his own biography , but this is perhaps not without interest either .
I get the impression that what now counts most of all , in fact , is to persuade the Greek Cypriot community that the plan that has been devised , the latest plan to be on the table – and there will not be another – is in their interests too .
Mr Turmes , may I congratulate you on your excellent English and on your commitment to this subject .
Finally , I should like to mention the Barnier report on the creation of Europe Aid .
In case you had forgotten : the Lisbon treaty was sunk by the democratic will of the people of Ireland .
Mr President , I should like first to extend my group &apos; s warmest thanks to the two rapporteurs .
So far , however , the programme has only promoted projects within Europe , and this promotion programme is no longer adequate at a time of globalisation of the markets and new technologies .
A written question of mine last year was connected with the hampering effect these roaming charges have on competition .
In this respect , the Committee on Industry considers that spectrum policy cannot be solely market @-@ driven , that the economic and social value of the radio spectrum should not be assessed on the basis of profit opportunity and that we need a balanced combination of commercial and social interests .
EU competitiveness will only improve by promoting entrepreneurship and by investing in research , product development and education and training .
It is very important to promote a family @-@ friendly approach to work .
Is it not better to tighten up the existing system than spend billions of euros on equipment , when it is known that the equipment does not detect explosives concealed inside the human body ?
- ( PT ) We cannot overemphasise the importance of support instruments for small and medium @-@ sized undertakings , which play a crucial role in job creation , in the impetus for investment and in the economic growth of the Member States and the European Union .
This is not at all the case and it is in this climate of confusion within the committee that a roughly equal number of votes for and against were cast , hence this proposal .
The Commission has worked very closely with the main stakeholders , social partners , local authorities , service providers and users in drawing up such a framework .
He will know that I am the rapporteur manqué for one such report , relating to OLAF .
Finally , I would remind the House that in all probability the total Community contributions for the period following 1999 will be conditioned by the commitment rate achieved as of 31 December 1999 .
Thanks to the support of the Cards Programme , we have been developing specific law enforcement capabilities in those countries to fight against drug trafficking .
Economic policy and energy policy should have a central goal : social progress and improving our peoples &apos; living conditions ; however , what is happening is the opposite .
To comply with the level proposed by the European Commission , those Member States which have water mains consisting of lead pipes will have to make a gigantic financial effort , despite the fact that no one knows at present what the best replacement material might be as far as long @-@ term health is concerned .
The same applies to the next oral amendment .
We appear not to be in agreement , however , about how this is to be achieved .
The business of the European Commission is very little about spending money .
This is the question we need to ask ourselves .
I am glad that a few years ago this concept was enshrined in the policy : now we call it lifelong learning .
The current political crisis in North Africa and the resulting migration confirm the need for a strong European approach to immigration and asylum .
This is perhaps the greatest mistake the European Union has made to date ; it has already caused us serious problems in the past and still poses a threat for the future .
It has been asked what the Commission will do if the report is accepted .
There are therefore different competent working parties studying these topics within the framework of the Council and the Council will consider this work before the end of the year .
Finally , to Mr Dillen who , if I understood correctly , mentioned a project he said we financed in the Democratic Republic of Congo , I can say that for several years now we have not provided any more finance in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
The humanitarian consequences of this operation are dramatic for the population in Gaza .
Another significant and positive step forward is the agreement concluded between the Council and the Commission , as a result of which the Commission must now submit a Letter of Amendment for agricultural expenditure to its preliminary draft budget , before the first reading of the budget , so that the budget forecasts can be better assessed , this being a difficult exercise as regards agriculture .
Secondly , I would like to record the following .
Today I also supported amendments which sought to make social and environmental reporting obligatory and supported the kind of reform of the CAP which would &quot; make poverty history &quot; .
3 .
In short , it is to produce European , in Europe , with Europeans .
Lastly , creativity , innovation and entrepreneurship should be encouraged , so that Europe &apos;s young people and workers can broaden their knowledge and thus adapt to the needs of the economy .
These manoeuvres are absurd .
Requirements that would help boost public confidence would also help farmers to regain control over this important industry .
That instrument is fundamentally important now and should remain so , especially for fighting mafia groups and organised crime .
The Commission &apos;s intentions are simply to limit , as far as possible , the charging of customs fees ; in particular , such fees should not be charged for the drawing @-@ up of electronic declarations .
The access of millions of people to health services is being restricted or complicated , and is by no means being improved or safeguarded .
I have put forward an idea of 15 basic principles to help facilitate agreement .
Adult stem cells are a promising development , worthy of mention .
The Pensioners &apos; Party is totally against any attempt by the European governments or Europe to extend the length of citizens &apos; working lives . Rather , we are calling for the length of time spent working to be reduced and the length of time spent at leisure , when it is not obligatory for citizens to work , to be increased .
I really do not exclude the possibility , on which the experts also agree , that this contraband can also reach the old Member States of the European Union .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as a Hungarian from Slovakia , I declare that the Slovak language law is bad .
My Group , of course , believes this to be essential , given the current circumstances , and I am certain that , at the end of this debate , the Commissioner will be convinced that this presumption is agreed on by the enormous majority of this House .
Parliament &apos;s participation in the appointment of the President of the European Central Bank and the other members of the Executive Board will also give the people of Europe an opportunity to find out beforehand about the people who will be responsible for the Union &apos;s monetary policy .
Mr President , Commissioner , I too congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work . I am particularly pleased about the unanimity shown on this issue within the group .
The accession of Greece , Portugal and Spain made the problems greater , and as time went by we had a growing surplus of table wines which had to be brought under control .
The orientation of this new government , under the guidance of the Prime Minister , Mrs Cheik Azina , offers new hope for finding a peaceful political settlement .
We also shared experience of totalitarian regimes .
The Committee on Agriculture decided that both an increase in the overall quota and changes to the quotas allocated to individual countries would be out of the question .
We advocate respect for human rights , including the rights of workers , and for social and environmental standards and democratic principles and for this to always be included as conditions in a trade agreement .
I think a European force would be more likely than any other to be accepted by both sides for such a task .
We need to go beyond Amsterdam and look further in order to be able to realise the historic commitment to enlarging eastwards , and to guarantee further progress in the integration process that is working against the risks of dilution and stagnation .
We ask the Commission to submit , at least annually , reports on the implementation of the agreement in question .
Why do you not say quite clearly that the ever @-@ widening gap between rich and poor is no longer acceptable ?
After investigating my complaint for a year , the European Ombudsman decided that the European Commission did not infringe the citizens &apos; right to equal access to information .
This initial phase is not about expanding the list of hazardous substances .
The forest fire phenomenon is aggravated by rural depopulation , the progressive abandonment of traditional activities , poor forest management , the existence of vast expanses of forest planted with one single species , the planting of non @-@ adapted tree species , the absence of an effective prevention policy , the levity of penalties imposed in cases of arson , and the flawed implementation of laws forbidding illegal construction and guaranteeing reforestation .
We have two and a half more years to show that that measure is entirely useless and contrary to the equality amongst nations that should govern the future of our international organisation .
In September 2004 , this House made a decision to send a fact @-@ finding mission to Vojvodina , the northern part of Serbia , which is not only a human rights matter but also a solidarity matter since there are very many Hungarians , and also Romanians and Germans , living there who ended up there through the storms of history .
I would like to dedicate the third consideration to the group which is most affected by this social scourge ; our young people .
I am asking for these pragmatic steps to be implemented at the earliest possible juncture .
The policy of the Chinese government - one country , two systems - will demonstrate the superiority of the market , but at the same time the cultural influence of the values of western civilization will convince the Chinese people to take the road of freedom .
Report ( A5 @-@ 0418 / 2001 ) by Mr Gahler , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , on the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on EU relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran ( COM ( 2001 ) 71 - C5 @-@ 0338 / 2001 - 2001 / 2138 ( COS ) )
That conflicts with , for example , the accession agreements signed by these countries when they became EU Member States .
Secondly , I agree with the rapporteur &apos;s statement that the pressure fishing places on stocks must not be dealt with in a uniform and global way and must instead take account of the particular characteristics of each fishing area and the specific nature of each fish species .
If we had known about this proposal beforehand , we could have gone ahead with it .
At the same time , some quite encouraging new developments are also observable in the Serb @-@ held areas of Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina .
The Commission will draw up an interim report after completion of the first step of the selection procedure and a final report once the procedure is finished .
A clear and positive message has been sent from Europe to the Irish people .
Canada is undoubtedly a trade partner of the EU , but it is imperative that we in Parliament relay the concerns of our fellow citizens located both on European territory and in regions forming part of the European family , namely , the protection and defence of their interests .
We know that the shrinking Greenland ice alone could result in an increase in sea levels of up to two metres .
The pharmaceutical industry is trying to delay the sale of generic products , and this is normal .
Not only there , but also in Europe , its practice of dumping - in the form of export subsidies - destroyed or marginalised rural farming , bringing even greater hunger , forcing countries into a state of dependency , and causing debts to accumulate .
I support the proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on an EU @-@ Brazil Strategic Partnership and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur .
Mr Nielson , there was a long debate about this earlier this morning and you must accept that there is very little time between now and 1 July 2004 for all ships and ports to comply with the requirements of the ISPS Code , especially with the lack of total clarity at the moment .
Nonetheless , I support the Ombudsman &apos;s position , since I believe that collaboration between the institutions is , and should continue to be , one of the strong points of their roles .
The Commission therefore accepts the addition of the reference in the text aimed at emphasising this aspect , as in the case of Amendments Nos : 33 , 34 , 37 , 42 , 43 and 44 .
I could smile a little at that , for even that is now possible in the EU .
Parliament is also part of this blame game now and then .
Nonetheless , some principles are absolute and ought not to be sacrificed to expediency .
We remember , Mr Delors , your speech at the College of Europe in Bruges at the beginning of 1990 .
Mr President , I wish to thank President Santer for his speech here today , and also Mr Mitchell and Mr Spring .
The report supports the main points identified by the Ministerial Declaration on the Digital Agenda approved at the Informal Meeting of Telecommunications Ministers in Granada on 18 and 19 April .
For that reason the Member States make decisions on such matters independently .
I am very pleased to see that many European countries reacted so positively and made aid available immediately when the dreadful events occurred , and the European Union , furthermore , is considering , as a result , how a new beginning in the relationship between the European Union and Turkey can be achieved .
It is true that , based on the proposed changes , the Member States taking part in the resettlement programme for the first time would receive somewhat greater financial support , and there would be an opportunity to define the geographic regions designated for resettlement and the nationalities in need of resettlement each year .
The same type of derogation and the same argument should apply to our colleagues in the new Member States .
Services of general interest ensure security of supply .
Examples of this are laws on social protection , the job market , health , justice and gender equality .
It has been felt that it is more appropriate that , instead of the outgoing Commission , the new Commission takes a clear position on this issue because the new Commission will be in charge of defending or promoting the EU position at the conference .
Cooperation with the South Caucasus in the energy sector and in fostering democracy and good governance must be included among the EU &apos;s main priorities .
May I ask what form such an asylum law would take ?
In this area , the Commission must , on every point , be given clear assurances on interpretation and compliance .
I do not know that the statement that we hear from you is really going to be best for the future of salmon producers within the European Community .
in writing . - ( EL ) Even though we are clearly opposed to quotas on any agricultural product , why does the EU set so many barriers on the development of production that each Member State could achieve depending on its needs and abilities , but we agree to increase quotas for Lithuania and Poland regarding the production of potatoes ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , when we speak today about a new bus directive which contains special regulations for the carriage of passengers with reduced mobility , we should bear in mind , particularly in view of the recent debate about increasing road safety - after all , 1.6 million people suffer often permanent injuries in accidents - that we could in fact ourselves be one of them tomorrow . We too would then have to cope with living as a disabled person .
However , there is still a long way to go before it becomes a reality .
It is not a simple matter where everything is fine if we budgetise .
Are there plans to negotiate an international agreement , similar to the PNR agreement ?
If this area is to be created , we need legislation on it at European level to be very well constructed , and on this we are , step by step , making good progress , but we also have to create an infrastructure to build on if we are not to end up with a ruin and give our citizens good cause for disappointment .
The political debate on sport in Europe often attributes great importance to the so @-@ called &apos; European Sport Model &apos; .
As regards the prevention of PVC waste , we feel that this would be better dealt with in a horizontal directive , and we are expecting a proposal from the Commission on this shortly .
We will not accept discrimination , and we will not give up the protection of human life and human dignity .
That concludes the explanations of vote .
Therefore , ladies and gentlemen , as we have always said , there is no plan B. It does not exist .
Even so , it certainly plays a vital part in spreading social , economic and environmental welfare , especially in those areas of our Europe where not just the landscape but also the socioeconomic and demographic fabric is vulnerable .
But first of all we should concentrate on rounding off the bilateral agreements with our partners .
Our particular concern is that there be a very detailed analysis of the economic and commercial situation , as we believe that economic stability is the only way to achieve long @-@ term security in the region as a whole .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is impossible to say everything that needs to be said in the space of a minute , so I shall select what is possible .
I think it is appropriate to point out that the House is now discussing for the umpteenth time matters related to the somewhat new institutional exercise of fighting for lawfulness , in other words against crime .
It will also be a tremendous opportunity to discuss legal immigration .
It is too simplistic to say that we are protecting the consumer by laying down that the applicable law and competent court are in all cases , without exception , those of consumer &apos;s place of residence .
These arsenals therefore have to be dismantled and North Korea must sign the nuclear non @-@ proliferation treaty at once and allow IAEA inspectors from Vienna to carry out the appropriate inspections .
The number of complaints rose substantially during the first ten months of last year , compared to the same period in 2003 .
In any event , however , I now put to the vote the request by the ARE Group .
Yet I wonder how many states would have accepted the multiple political aggressions of which Yugoslavia , a founder member of the United Nations , has been a victim over the past seven years on the part of certain European countries or some sections of this Parliament .
The EU is no more than a paper tiger in this matter ; the responsibility lies with Member States .
Mr President , for a long time shipbuilding has been subject to strong commercial pressure from third countries - such as South Korea , China and others - which are causing serious complications to the market due to , among other things , the competitive devaluations of their currencies , with the passive consent of the International Monetary Fund .
Indeed , Mr Prodi made it one of his key objectives when he first came to office in 1999 .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in 2002 the three European institutions worked together in order to draw up a new financial regulation , and this now gives us a clear framework for the subsidies by means of which we support a large number of excellent European organisations in the fields of culture , youth and education .
The pretensions of Western leaders to lead the world and their agencies for managing the world economy along free @-@ enterprise lines have , since Seattle , been the object of criticism and active protest from a movement of thousands of associations and millions of people and even some States - I am thinking of South Africa - who are asking for an alternative , democratic model of globalisation oriented towards satisfying the often tragic needs of communities , especially in the developing world .
The next item on the agenda is voting time .
Today &apos;s reality is obvious ; there is a clear and increasing need for awareness as regards the consequences of smoking among the entire European society .
The current trend is to be on hand as quickly as possible to ensure that animals do not continue to suffer physically .
Mr President , I largely support the reports before us on better regulation and the interinstitutional agreement , and indeed their objectives : to secure a reliable , up @-@ to @-@ date and user @-@ friendly body of law to benefit all our citizens , workers and businesses .
That is why we are going to support him but , of course , this gradual implementation seems to me to be fundamental to the consumer being able to accept and take this process on board .
We do very much concern ourselves with promoting good quality control and screening , but of course it is a matter for the Member States how they organize their own screening activities .
Our intention was to concentrate on various major issues which have arisen as the debates in the Intergovernmental Conference have progressed .
The poor and the low @-@ paid die younger , suffer more physical and mental illness , are hospitalised more , are imprisoned more , are excluded from participating fully in society , are denied full cultural , civil , social , and indeed secure lives , and their children are largely condemned to the same vicious cycle of deprivation - unless , that is , we as politicians pursue social and economic policies which are integrated and interdependent .
Some artistes presented a very impressive case to demonstrate the problems facing them under the current system which operates via collecting societies .
In summary , the procedure which it has opted for in order to achieve this basic objective is as follows : the Member States implement the most recent provisions of international conventions , except for those expressly referred to and incorporated in a Community act , which are dealt with directly by the European Commission , which either refers them for exclusion to the Committee on Safe Seas or does not refer them , in which case they apply automatically .
It is in need of humanitarian aid , and especially food aid , and this help has been given to Madagascar .
If not , it will be with full knowledge of the facts that they will have to take on board the economic , social , environmental and financial consequences of their political inconsistency .
It is important that the report emphasises that EU foreign and defence policy is intertwined with a variety of very important areas of life in the European Union .
. Madam President , with regard to Mrs Segelström &apos;s question on Colombia , although it has been reported by several sources that violations of human rights in Colombia are decreasing , any violation of human rights is a cause for concern .
Secondly , President Musharraf has also banned independent exit polls on this election .
This is a good basis for Serbia to fully use the integration potential that the year 2011 offers .
Community incentive measures in employment
These statements in some degree declare people in the Member States incapable of managing their own affairs and are thus evidence of an unpleasant attitude towards the population .
Mercosur ’ s fortunes have waxed and waned in recent years over the imbalances in trade between Argentina and Brazil in particular – a matter constantly under criticism from Argentina , which last September proposed to Brazil a safeguard clause to which Brazil refuses to agree .
Lastly , in reply to Mrs Frassoni , let me emphasise that you must take my words in their strictest sense .
All it adds is more red tape and more work for the businesses in question .
In doing so he was merely exercising his right to freedom of expression and his right to seek information on human rights and fundamental freedoms as a whole .
Moving on to another , equally important , issue , I welcomed Mr Barroso ’ s hard @-@ hitting remarks on the EU ’ s Financial Perspective .
We cannot agree to ending the use of remote controlled aircraft , as this would cause a significant reduction in the safety of these people .
The other Member States from the Eurozone , including Portugal , would be integrated into one or two groups with a rotating voting system , with votes weighted according to GDP size .
We would , for example , like the Council to indicate the measures it intends to take in respect of this Education Minister .
I would underline this statement , especially as the Lisbon Strategy is calling for more money and greater investment , including from public finances – I need only mention education and research .
We are always so proud , with Europeans and Americans each believing the one to be a purely European business and the other a purely American one .
Thank you .
It would be regrettable if this balance were to be disturbed by tomorrow &apos; s vote , besides which , it is highly unlikely in my view that the Council would be able to agree on the tabled amendments .
I should also like us to ensure that the misery that we are seeing in Asia today does not make us turn our backs on the poverty , the underdevelopment , the hunger and the death of innocent people elsewhere .
Fourthly , the Community patent .
There are a number of points that I unfortunately do not have time to go into here , but I should like to mention the fact that through the issue of family reunification , we have introduced the question of exceptional cases . I should also like to stress that under no circumstances shall we accept the amendment tabled by the PPE Group which seeks to lower the age at which children have the right to family reunification to 16 .
At the same time it ill @-@ behoves those anti @-@ Europeans to dance on the grave of the Eastern European nations that are so anxious to join the European Union and to join us in this House .
The Court of Auditors also reported , for the second year running , that the Agency paid out amounts on the basis of unilateral grant decisions signed by the Agency , while the rules in force make no provision for this type of instrument .
Because the unofficial G7 resolution is not legally binding we must ensure that other parties honour their promises too .
Certain forms of precarious work performed by women , such as paid domestic work and care , are simply not visible on the labour market .
The prolongation of a patent by six months is yet another gift to the pharmaceutical multinationals , in total disregard of the health of children and running counter to the objectives of this very regulation .
It is also vital to improve the current situation of women working in industry .
I am therefore pleased that our rapporteur has done just this by saying that it is unrealistic to set any deadline before 2015 .
Once the subsidies finish , we will have no more money left for Europe @-@ wide campaigns on tobacco , so that , again , is an impossible situation and I hope we come up with a solution in the near future .
We welcome the fact that , by means of this framework decision , the European Union is supporting the Convention on the Protection of the Environment through criminal law that was approved in the Council of Europe in 1998 and which has so far not been ratified by enough States to enter into force .
Not everything has been acquired yet , but we are on the road to consultation .
I am therefore very much aware that the suspension was not designed to prevent the French state &apos;s entry into Alstom &apos;s capital as such .
Europe is even divided on the very appropriateness of a public agricultural policy .
The only good thing is that employers are subsidised for taking on people with disabilities .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , this report was submitted by the Commission before the Members of this House had ever heard of any Agenda 2000 document , even in draft form .
in writing . ( PT ) If anyone were in any doubt as to the objectives of these recommendations , one would only have to take a close look at the information provided on them by Parliament : recognition &apos; for the first time &apos; of the public authorities &apos; free choice of the operators of so @-@ called road and rail passenger transport &apos; public services &apos; , be they public or private .
Also to be welcomed is the proposal for a directive &apos;s provision to force Member States to set up a system for removing personal data in the event that they decide to set up a system for the non @-@ mandatory reporting of data useful to air safety ?
That is why , despite the fact that after difficult negotiations and completely contrary to the spirit of the Treaties , two Member States have finally been allowed to opt out of monetary union , this does not mean that they no longer have to act in tandem with all the others when it comes to realigning exchange rates .
With regard to the grounds for optional non @-@ execution , I also ask whether it may not be appropriate to restrict them in the case of offences typically attributable to organised crime , including the offence of association with a mafia organisation , for which double criminality should not apply anyway .
Neither were we surprised , therefore , when the compromise paper presented by the German Presidency attracted not only support but also criticism .
We need budgetary discipline and efficiency , and we should adhere strictly to what our main task is and not expand beyond that task , which is legislative work .
At the present moment in time , that requirement transcends the need to cut milk subsidies .
I , too , join in the condemnation expressed by this European Parliament with regard to ETA &apos; s abandonment of the truce . I can confirm my total rejection of the use of violence to achieve political aims .
The Commission has paid great attention to the need to ensure a balanced and inclusive representation of the sports movement when organising meetings and events .
Thank you very much for your answer .
The EU &apos;s political priorities undergo adjustment , bringing them more into line with the concerns and fears of ordinary citizens .
Without this campaign we would not have been successful in delivering the very ambitious targets on raising employment and reducing poverty in Europe .
The White Paper dates from 1995 .
In my view , both these proposals contain a series of regulations which , on their own terms , are reasonable and humane .
They do not accept euro @-@ scepticism , the fear of Europe .
I am therefore taking the floor because I want to sound a note of warning .
I have been a Member of this House for 11 years . In all that time , I have never come across such frankness in a presentation on a European Council by its Presidency .
I would urge that we should consider preserving sites and using sites in that way rather than simply clearing them off the face of the earth at great expense .
Climate change remains one of the most significant environmental concerns for the Union .
No one wants to keep the present status quo , with energy supply consisting of monopoly structures .
The EU has a special responsibility in negotiating on the Chair &apos;s Statement , and I hope the Council will confirm today that it will postpone producing a draft text until the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has produced recommendations for this year .
The European business community would react against such a move and that would lead to less investment and , in turn , to fewer jobs .
This is why , yet again , we urge the European Union to go back to the principle of Community preference , a pillar of the Treaty of Rome sacrificed to American interests during the Uruguay Round negotiations .
This day is a great triumph for the citizens of the European Union , and all of us can rejoice at that with heart and soul .
Secondly , payments must be made .
In my view that was and still is unacceptable .
We come back time and time again , in this Parliament , to two criticisms .
It is mired in political correctness .
Young people are at the heart of European social and inclusion strategies .
I appeal to all those involved in the conflict to cease forthwith from violence , and I call on the Turkish Government to accept the Kurds ’ lawfully elected representatives as negotiating partners and to drop the latest charges against them .
I believe , Mr President , that we can make progress on the focal points that you have mapped out .
This is a debate that I should like to enter into with you .
She drew attention to the injustice that is still being done to the Iranian people because the Mujaheddin , who fight for a democratic constitutional state on European lines , still feature on our list of terrorist organisations .
Censorship and media bans are , of course , widespread and persistent .
Destitution , poverty and social exclusion are violations of dignity and the European Union prides itself on doing everything in its power to establish this right to health protection wherever disease is due to poverty .
We heard yesterday that Mr Santer went all the way and promised that everything should be marked , and that all modified products would be marked .
Mexico has opened itself up to the USA , but it is also prepared to open itself up to Europe .
This is up to them and their members .
However , if we want to achieve joint successes , these successes have to be based on truthfulness and on sensible working methods and structures .
It is important because , as Mr Patten said , India is a democracy , the largest in the world , and it is a country located at the heart of Asia , at the very heart of an Asia which , at the start of this new millennium , I think represents the greatest danger of the next century , much more so than the issues we have been discussing already today , like Austria , for instance .
Not only will this new regulation help us improve security in the air , it will also reduce costs , simplify the rules and protect civil aviation more effectively .
In the past the European Union has been criticized on the grounds that it is going to be a great melting pot in which small communities and minorities will all be lost .
This has not been the case .
In due course , Nordic cooperation should also be extended to the Barents Sea region , which is rich in natural resources but is also of strategic importance .

Such instruments exist ; now all we have to do is to use them .
The decision relating to the re @-@ admission agreement has just been signed today .
It cannot be right that countries with whom we have association agreements are still at a disadvantage and are still on this list .
Thirdly , on the future EU Member States : we need to integrate candidate countries at the very earliest opportunity if we want to achieve our ambitious aim of transforming the European Union into the most competitive , dynamic , knowledge @-@ based economy in the world within eight years .
This is a system which cannot function in the long term , and a European monetary fund , managed by the Commission and , if necessary , by the ECB , is therefore required .
Our objective must be to provide equal healthcare , without intervention on the part of the European Union in social security systems and without aiming to commercialise the health sector .
This resulted in a drastic reduction in the number of farms and in the level of jobs in agriculture , thereby increasing unemployment in agricultural regions and dangerously accelerating the depopulation of the countryside . The average income resulting from agricultural activity throughout the EU fell by 3.9 % in relation to 1997 .
We will bring this issue up again .
It is therefore in the strategic interest of the European Union .
Mr President , before the vote on the legislative resolution I should just like to confirm again that the changes which the Commission has made to Amendments Nos 2 and 3 are of an editorial nature rather than a substantive one - insofar as an amendment represents a supplement to the existing legal text - in other words , that these changes are in accordance with what we are voting on here , so that we shall then have a common position from Parliament and the Commission .
I personally supported the amendment proposals on this without hesitation .
There is an argument within Parliament over aid relief earmarked for organisations and bodies .
Mr Schüssel , I wish you luck .
We established that the Member States have cut thousands of jobs in the customs services .
These essential elements are : food availability , production , strategic reserves and trade in food ; access to food - for example economic growth , employment , income , to make this access realistic ; response to crisis situations , such as safety nets ; and nutritional problems , which , in the long term , constitute the main element in all this .
The European Union and United States aviation markets , taken together , account for about 60 % of world air traffic .
To put it another way , the vote took place when this House was in possession of false information .
If production cannot continue to take place in Europe because of the soaring cost of emissions trading , and if , as a consequence , steel or paper , say , are produced in places where the ensuing emissions are greater than in Europe , emissions will increase overall .
The proposal for a directive currently under review is one of the measures announced in the Commission Green Paper relating to supplementary pensions in the EU .
But we must also recognize that process will be immensely difficult .
in writing . - ( PT ) Brazilian citizens can travel to all Member States of the European Union without a visa , provided that this is for short stays , under the terms of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 539 / 2001 .
When the debate in Parliament and in the Council has been at its most vehement , the Commission has , in accordance with its fundamental role , endeavoured to use constructive arguments to take the drafting process in a sustainable direction .
We also back the initiative from the Belgian and Dutch Home Affairs Ministers , which attempts to introduce travel bans for this kind of hooligan when high @-@ risk events are due to take place .
I am glad that the Estonian Commissioner , who is familiar with conditions in the northern countries , knows this , and that also applies to the Slovakian rapporteur .
It follows that our own countries , far from being able to rest upon the laurels they won in the past , must go down roads that are new and innovative for Europe .
I would also like the European Parliament to be much more involved in the initial discussions next time .
I am concerned that the conservatives are using this method to reintroduce nuclear power by the back door .
If your own group , which drafted the amendment , does not object and if there are no violent protests from other Members , I propose that we proceed as you suggest .
Madam President , I have a request for information about a matter of order .
You have spoken , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , of new common initiatives at European level in the field of immigration .
Too little and too slowly perhaps ; but I think we have made progress .
I invite euro zone Member States to properly implement the euro zone membership criteria that were adopted by the Member States themselves for better economic integration .

They are clearly not the parties responsible for epizootic disease ; they are its victims .
We in Europe can no longer catch up with the United States in the area of defence technology ; and perhaps we do not need to .
Those who did not cause this crisis but are the most affected urgently need help .
However , I am aware that this proposal originates with the Committee on International Trade , whose criteria relating to several issues are very different from those that I am able to have .
We must launch a thorough debate on the Constitution and what it means for the future of Europe .
So it is the last item tomorrow , motions for resolutions on Wednesday and the vote on Thursday .
The EU should pay more attention to their problems and aspirations .
In early 2000 concrete information on specific imports from Israeli settlements was supplied to the Commission .
Below cost sales is not an act of charity , but the taking over of a market share , which will have to be compensated elsewhere .
However , I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Cornillet , for his report , as he offers a good approach with this report .
Kosovo is no better off at the moment .
The main duty of the European Union is to offer help to stabilise the region in the areas of economy and social development , not only to Kosovo and Serbia but to the whole western Balkan region .
It could be said that the climate is further down the political agenda today than it was prior to Copenhagen .
It reminds Ukrainian politicians and government organs of the need for political and economic stabilisation , which can , in particular , be achieved by constitutional reform , a consolidation of the rule of law , the establishment of a social market economy , renewed efforts to combat corruption , and the improvement of the economic and investment climate .
It is a critical time for stability in the Middle East .
Here , too , we are expected to comply with the principle of subsidiarity .
Also , we must not forget those late developers who we need to give a second chance to by opening doors to our education and training systems .
It is about vibrations , noise , and so on . Extensive research has been done in the Netherlands , for example , as to how well @-@ being at work should be interpreted .
First of all I am pleased that Mr Prodi does not favour a President of the European Union as Mr Giscard d &apos;Estaing has proposed .
Multi @-@ annual programme 2010 @-@ 2014 regarding the area of freedom , security and justice ( Stockholm Programme ) ( vote )

There are social and cultural rights which advanced societies such as ours in western Europe should be able to guarantee .
More particularly , as far as French legislation is concerned - which Mr Rothley has mentioned - and as it was drafted at the time , in the judgement of 10 January 1995 on the Leclerc case , no . 229 / 83 &quot; Au blé vert &quot; , the Court of Justice decreed that , in the sphere of national legislation establishing a fixed book price system , rules which establish that the publisher &apos; s fixed price must be observed , as regards the sale of books published in the Member State itself , and which are reimported prior to export to another Member State , constitute measures with an effect equivalent to import restrictions , which are prohibited under Article 28 ( ex Article 30 ) of the Treaty , unless there are well @-@ grounded reasons to believe that the aforementioned books have been exported with the sole aim of reimporting them with the intention of evading the aforementioned law .
It is a matter of eliminating barriers to the supply and use of ICT products .
The Commission was not , however , able to support the common position where it sought to exclude the European Parliament from the procedure to establish and modify Annex II Part B , which affects the scope of the directive , nor Article 21 , where the Council would still wish to stick to a 3b regulatory committee procedure instead of the 2a procedure proposed by the Commission following the first opinion of Parliament .
Finally , as far as the proposal for an annual report on illiteracy to Parliament is concerned , we want to look at the most efficient way of informing Parliament and what use Parliament can make of reports on national action plans on social integration and reports via the open method of coordination , i.e. how existing means , reports which are drafted every year anyway , how this dimension can be used so that the information provided is exponential and more efficient .
If we do not do it under SAB 2 , then we could certainly do it under SAB 3 .
We have also known that what happens to some people will also happen to others and I think that if the European Parliament could , by observing a minute &apos; s silence , express its solidarity with this officer &apos; s family and loved ones , with the gendarmerie and with all French and European citizens affected by this evil , it would be sending out a very important signal .
Health claims should only be authorised for use in the Community after a scientific assessment of the highest possible standard , and nutrition and health claims must not be misleading .
I cannot therefore support the directive .
I am very grateful to members of the other groups for their cooperation , which has been extremely fair and thoroughly accommodating .
I agree it was stupid to set in advance the date by which all the Member States simultaneously had to achieve a balanced budget .
I think he should visit some of those &apos; ailing shipyards &apos; , and he will realize that they are competing with shipyards in other countries such as Korea .
The concentration on those particularly affected by unemployment , increased investment in vocational training and the increase in the intensity of employment give reason to hope that the campaign against unemployment may be waged aggressively , with something more concrete than paper and words .
There has , for a long time , been an increase in cases of violence of all kinds suffered by Muslim women within their own families .
The answer will depend on the circumstances in the individual countries .
A few years ago we thought that the EBRD would not play a major role in those Member States , for instance , which are outside the euro area , and that the EBRD would instead move eastwards ; now we are pleased that along with the World Bank , these two institutions have made a large Central European fund possible .
Madam President , the issue we are again discussing today - in the hope of being able to arrive at a definition of it - is of the greatest importance for the European internal market .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is politics , and not religion , that we are debating here .
As emerged from the report on the common fisheries policy after 2002 , which was debated this afternoon in this Chamber , fisheries agreements give a significant boost to the Community fleet at a time of imbalance between capacity and resources , thereby generating economic activity and creating employment in the European Union .
The situation must not change now , it must change right now .
An official there said to me that my rural region did not need any inward investment as everybody there is a rich farmer .
Amendment No 98 is acceptable , in making clear that the authority can express &apos; independently &apos; its own conclusions and orientations .
The United States now acknowledges the existence of the &apos; Echelon &apos; system .
Primarily , that is the task of the World Trade Organization , which will have to take a very rapid decision under the dispute settlement procedure .
That , to my mind , is only fair .
No distinction is made between those who do not fulfil and those who no longer fulfil the conditions in force for residence here .
First there is the question , do we need a fleet policy or not ?
Last but not least , we must not forget those 40 people still missing and thought to have been taken hostage .
Political common sense tells us that it is up to the Member State in question to appoint this body .
Such a measure would be demagogic and totally ill @-@ suited in the current situation .
Corporate responsibility is foremost .
Over @-@ regulation is significantly reducing people &apos;s motivation and alienating them from the concept of Europe , which is why we want an independent assessment of the impact of legislation .
What the majority in Parliament would like to see is a major propaganda campaign to pressure the citizens into accepting the so @-@ called European Constitution .
Your report very rightly places a heavy emphasis on this issue .
Therefore , I ask the Turkish authorities to reinsert the reference to sexual identity into the draft law on combating discrimination and inequality .
Therefore , the review of this directive on the energy performance of buildings is really very timely and necessary during the current crisis .
We are at present faced with a report which presents a number of difficulties in the field of research and development .
I compliment the Turkish politicians on their ninth package of legislative reforms and the many proposals that were adopted by Parliament .
Thanks to the action of MPs and of our group in particular , a new version was drawn up .
It is the thirty @-@ eighth time we have tabled it , so I hope that it will also be the last .
And this cultural change must be extended to all social groups , so that equal opportunities are real and not just symbolic , only existing on paper .
And rightly so .
This is an issue we cannot ignore .
I agree to the proposal , but cannot refrain from making one small remark in conclusion , namely that life for Parliament would surely be even better and even more democratic if there were less or no comitology .
The Presidency has a special responsibility for ensuring that the EU is now finally ready to sign this agreement .
Madam President , Mr Stockmann sounded rather resigned when he said that the issue of energy efficiency is not exactly centre @-@ stage in political debate at present .
However , his familiarity with issues relating to southern Europe doubtless gives him an awareness of the problems which these countries experience .
I am not thinking of huge livestock farms , but of the creation of new solutions which make it easier to grow crops , raise animals and produce healthy and ecological food , as well as to obtain energy from alternative sources .
In reply to Mr Fatuzzo &apos;s question about the internal redistribution of pensions , we must remember that this is a purely national model and that it is in fact up to each government to decide what type of pension it is going to grant and where , depending on the model and principles it has decided on .
Therefore , if the spare parts are not produced by the original car manufacturer but by third parties , the buyer must be informed accordingly .
I think it would be not only very short @-@ sighted but also a dangerous strategy to exclude Parliament at this stage .
It is our role here today to make an initial political response to the Treaty of Amsterdam .
This will require an extensive review of pension systems and systems for health care and care of the elderly .
Headed &apos; Talk of emergencies misses the point &apos; , the article discussed the situation in Africa .
That is why I am not so keen on quotas .
We can only vote here on things that have really been worked through in committee .
But please fight for it , especially if you fail to muster complete support .
No doubt if Rome , Byzantium , Spain and Europe had had such plans , then Alaric , Attila , the Saracens , Tamburlaine , the Ottomans , the sack of Rome , the fall of Constantinople , the raids on the Mediterranean coasts and centuries of fear could all have been prevented .
If that cannot be shown clearly , then the legality of the temporary ban can and should be questioned in this case .

The vote will take place immediately after this debate .
What is needed most of all is that it should be made possible for the big criminal organisations to which reference was made earlier to be better punished or brought to justice by means of European law .
We were very clearly of the view , in the light of the decisions reached by the voters in France and the Netherlands , that it would be the wrong response simply to mechanistically continue a discussion of institutional architecture , when in fact probably the most accurate description of the vote – certainly in France and I would respectfully suggest also in the Netherlands – was that it related to both the text and the context .
But I would prefer to discuss the alternatives with you at a later date , because we feel that for the moment our first priority must be to secure the situation for the rest of this year and for 1999 through an interinstitutional agreement and remarks in the budget .
The European Parliament gives a high priority to the Lisbon process , which is a continuous process and is not limited to 2010 .
Indeed , at the same summit , a whole new front of regulation was opened up under the guise of tackling climate change - even down to the point of dictating the type of light bulbs that nation states and citizens can use !
The report affirms our belief in the importance of high @-@ quality services of general interest that are accessible to all .
Thank you , Mr Pasty .

I therefore believe , ladies and gentlemen , that we should seize the opportunity to send a strong message to the Council calling for it swiftly to reach an agreement on this important matter in order to ensure a welcome that is worthy of our Member States .
I note that the Minutes give no reason for the postponement of that report .
In fact , in 40 years , world fish production has increased fourfold , and today stands at around of 100 million tonnes , and world demand is increasing inexorably , in line with demographic growth .
The EU is fully committed to the fight against global terrorism , on the basis of its human values and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms .
For me , tonight will hopefully be the major culmination of the process .
I would like to applaud the supporting role played by Parliament in submitting the draft directive .
Subsidiarity must operate equally between municipalities and regions , just as it must operate between the institutions of the European Union and the Member States .
Likewise , for this reason , I think that the work of Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri is very careful , balanced and utterly worthy of support .
Once again , I read in the Annual Report of the Court of Auditors that - like other organisations - the Court has insufficient or even no access to the accounts of the United Nations , which means that large amounts of European funds channelled to this organisation cannot , in fact , be properly controlled .
Commissioner Verheugen was right this morning to declare this topic a priority , and I should like to give him my unqualified support in this .
Transparency must rule in the future .
Mr President , increased access to the EU market for Mercosur would decimate national industries , particularly - in my case - in my major concern : the beef industry in Ireland and elsewhere .
If we focus on assuring the mutual recognition of qualifications and invest in language training for those students who could potentially learn in another European country , we will go some way towards closing this gap .
Its primary objective was to strive for simplification and transparency and to introduce a more democratic system , giving Parliament a right to scrutinise the implementing powers for acts adopted under codecision .
SMEs are particularly important against the background of the economic and financial crisis , which was caused by the large rather than the small enterprises . SMEs are important because they too will soon be suffering , yet they are responsible for much of our economic performance .
Swedish legislation prohibits drug use . That is good , and that is how it should remain .
Mr President , I rather suspect that voters outside this House would have some difficulty understanding what is going on here this afternoon and indeed some of us may .

Hypocritical , lastly , Commissioner , is the fact that you expect industry to make an effort when the German Presidency protects big @-@ engined cars that consume too much energy and emit too much CO2 .
37 .
You can have a small sweatshop as well as an ethical business and regulation is there to support the latter , not the former .
Differences between the various penal systems of different countries render the struggle against counterfeiting and piracy more difficult .
There can be no future for a system like this in European regional policy .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to emphasize one fundamental point , and that is that a very important part of the quality of any democracy is measured by the degree of open control that can be exercised over the police and the penal institutions .
We believe that the European Union should abandon costly fisheries agreements of this type and switch over to providing support above all to the developing countries &amp; # x02BC ; own fisheries activities .
Reference has been made to the Structural Funds , and to the fact that they will be subject to a review in 2006 .
Confidence in the future on the part of businesses and households appears to have been dented , and unfortunately this effect is being compounded by the events of the war in Yugoslavia .
The question that then arises is whether we are to draw up policies for the consumer or for the companies involved in this European gas market .
Minus one percent next year will correspond to a Growth and Stability Pact of more than -3 % .

This is a controlled experiment that should be of value to us all .
Mr President , some claim that we should leave aside the issue of recognition of the state , when speaking about Kosovo , and instead deal with recognition of the reality .
His report is certainly an excellent memorial to the victims of the Estonia disaster .
The cartoons have aggrieved many Muslims all over the world .
A little while ago you spoke at length about events in Brussels .
So , there has been some progress .
It is even more important , however , that we take sensible action on the logistics .

What happened on the issue of joint programming on neurodegenerative diseases and , in particular , Alzheimer &apos;s disease , was that the rules changed in the middle of the process .
My fifth question is how many jobs have been put at risk in Europe because of this distortion in competition .
This will not be easy , but then , who said we should only have easy tasks to deal with ?
We believe in social capitalism .
There is so much energy that could be saved from everything around us , though .
Linking of this kind means that nuclear power cannot merely be left , as some would wish , to replace existing power stations which pollute the atmosphere with CO2 emissions .
It has not ceased to try and underestimate the number of civilians present in the war zone while it has even deprived them of all humanitarian aid , including food , water and healthcare .
Now they are all gone and we are not producing enough food fast enough to feed ourselves .
It is also good to remark , as colleagues have said , that this debate is attended by French , German , Austrian , Belgian , British and other colleagues .
I am very pleased that the American administration is showing such a strong interest in cooperating with us .
Something I have difficulty with , however , is the fact that several amendments have been tabled that could considerably weaken the proposal .

The accession process must therefore be part of a peace process .
I am pleased to see that the territorial dimension of cohesion policy has been emphasised , as it aims to create a balance between the development of urban and rural areas , as well as of regions with specific characteristics .

As Chairman of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport and having only just left a meeting of this same committee where we were voting without you , Mrs de Sarnez , I should like to say here that it was with widespread , indeed unanimous , enthusiasm that the Culture Committee worked on Mrs de Sarnez &apos;s excellent report .
Despite the fact that pressure brought to bear on Mr Barroso by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament resulted in a climb @-@ down on his part after he had presented his first Commission in October , I do not believe that the changes he has since made are anywhere near substantial enough to allow me to lend him my support .
I would call on the Council once again to study Parliament &apos; s constructive contribution .
I am sure much will happen in the interval and we should allow ourselves to do something more up @-@ to @-@ date at the time rather than establish a deadline this week .
Parliament &apos;s Committee on Budgets expressed its support for the four new institutions provided for under the Seventh Framework Programme .
There are investigations which demonstrate that a bacterial strain which is resistant to antibiotics is being specifically developed in milk processing to ensure that residues which may possibly occur in the milk are not effective .

The acquis communautaire must be strengthened , be it the single market , external trade policy - as Mr Santer proposed - which must be more offensive , common agriculture and fisheries policies which must be made more efficient but also fairer .
in writing . - I particularly welcome the proposals in this report to protect and encourage young farmers , through grant schemes and other measures .
Madam President , in the roll @-@ call vote on Amendment No 15 to the von Wogau report , my name appears as a vote in favour . I voted against .

There is worse to come , however .

This is not fair treatment .
It must grant the time for them .
The Commission acknowledges that this pollutant is directly toxic , especially for asthmatics and those with cardiovascular conditions , even in short peaks of excess pollution , and that is why such a tough limit was proposed in the first place .
When , however , I listened to the report of Mr Priestley , Secretary @-@ General of the European Parliament , in the Committee on Budgets , I had to admit that things were the same as ever : knowledge breeds problems .
In view of this , the questions you raised are indeed the right ones .
The decision by the Constitutional Court to ban the largest Kurdish party is , of course , quite unacceptable and also blocks membership .
I am convinced that the spirit of cooperation between Parliament and the Commission will produce positive ways forward in relation to the objectives which we hold dear .
The denial of EU prospects to Ukraine reflects the unfounded fears in the Council , on the part of the French in particular , of serious agricultural competition , and , on the part of the Germans , of serious industrial competition , notwithstanding the fact that the common agricultural policy will be obsolete by the time Ukraine is ready to join in 10 to 15 years &apos; time , and that industrial relocation is much more likely for a Ukraine in the WTO but outside the EU than it is for a Ukraine as a Member State of the EU with all the onerous single market requirements .
I also welcome the fact that the Council has called for a group of independent experts to advise on better regulation .
We do not , however , intend to go away and sulk : we will try even harder to make sure that our critical stances and demands make a contribution to the dialogue between the ECB and the European Parliament , which is overdue .
Anyone who dreaded the emergence of a centralised , almighty &apos; superstate &apos; should be more than reassured .
The Council has also approved in principle the view of Parliament that the sulphur content of light fuel oil should be limited far more drastically than was originally intended .

Yesterday , Blijdorp Zoo in Rotterdam announced that not a single European zoo has managed to breed polar bears .

It is important to note that the fact that negotiations with Turkey have been embarked on does not automatically mean that Turkey will become a member of the EU .
I therefore make a public appeal for the Chamber and the Member States to support this legislative package during the forthcoming plenary , as it will certainly enable us to tackle the major challenge that faces us .
Finally , I would like to stress the need for a pragmatic vision , as proposed by my political group .
It is much more important than that .

Human rights and democracy are cornerstones in our cooperation with Azerbaijan under the existing partnership and cooperation agreement .

We also consider that a timely campaign of information would be useful , advising consumers of the true risks , the possibility of prevention and the availability of drugs .
By obsessing on notions such as the &apos; ageing population &apos; , the need to &apos; modernise the European social model &apos; and the priority of &apos; the sustainability of public finances &apos; in relation to social systems , they are covering , strengthening and legalising the attempt being made by numerous governments in the European Union - such as Greece - to dismantle social protection systems and hand the workers over to private insurance companies without so much as a guarantee .
Commissioner , I want to go back to one of your previous answers . In this you mentioned what I would refer to as the possibilities of protecting the EU Treaty against any risks of deviation and , in particular , the variation of penalties which may be imposed on a Member State , pursuant to Article 7 , for the violation of fundamental freedoms .
The European Union is trying to do as much as possible to reduce the negative impact of pesticides on the environment and to prevent their accumulation in the soil , in water and in plants .
It is not really all that surprising , given all that had gone before , that after only seven years of the reform process in Russia , one cannot as yet point to any truly spectacular results .
As a member of this delegation , I trust we shall receive the full cooperation of the Turkish authorities on our visit at the beginning of June , in the hope that the European Parliament by applying the principle of hearing both sides of the argument can contribute to ending the tragedy of the hunger strikers .
How can this happen ?
It is a fact that the main priority for 2011 should be to push forward with the economic recovery .
It is downright embarrassing to see the omissions of past years finally being piled on the table at the end of this term of office .
At the same time , Commissioner van den Broek asked for effective priority for projects geared progress to consolidating democracy and projects of a social nature .

In conclusion , I do not know whether this report will enable us to deal with these issues , but I do know that there are many children , women and men in need of our help , and we must protect them .
Immigrants bring to their host communities different cultures and customs , different languages and religions . This is a source of enrichment , but it can be a source of discomfort – and even of division and alienation .
We are pro @-@ European , we want a united Europe and we are working for it , but we the Catalans and other Europeans from stateless nations do not believe that we are going in the right direction on some issues .
People criticise US protectionism ; and they wish to put forward trivial social measures , while proposing in point 44 to help the Maghreb and Turkey !
We have formulated very specific proposals based on these figures , which is why we have the support of the broad majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs : on a strategic level , we have made concrete proposals for the establishment of a structure of equal partnership between the military and civilian arms of the new European External Action Service ; while , on an operative level , we have resolved to establish a permanent European headquarters , to be staffed with personnel by the Member States , to deal with the issue of creating an attractive system of incentives for national experts to participate in such operations and the build @-@ up of personnel reserves for the future .
In my opinion , therefore , if we do not listen carefully to their comments and advice when amending the asylum system , then our work is unlikely to bring the desired effect .
Given this excellent report from the Committee on Culture and Education , as a Romanian historian and writer , I would like to propose for a European Heritage Label an exceptional site which is unique in the world - St Andrew &apos;s Cave , located close to the place where the Danube flows into the Black Sea .
We are not speaking about one reactor here and one reactor there . We are speaking about 4000 , 5000 , 6000 or 7000 reactors .
My constituency measures a distance of 1 300 kilometres across .
The declaration that I have the honour of signing after this sitting with President Pöttering and Prime Minister Sócrates is a wide @-@ ranging policy statement about our objectives , principles and good practice approaches to humanitarian aid , delivered both bilaterally by Member States and by the European Community .
What is more , the Council has regrettably failed to submit an assessment of the directive ’ s impact on small and medium @-@ sized enterprises and on the new Member States , as requested by Parliament .
The fifth point concerns the democratic deficit that still exists within the Union in fields relating to justice and home affairs .
The effort to synchronise the business environment of all 27 Member States seems to me a highly demanding ambition .
It is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and I am , I think , entitled to feel a little proud of him .
( Heckling )
I am therefore closely following his reasoning , which took account of the enlargement of the EU from 15 to 25 countries .
The European Union , within the framework of the European Securityand Defence Policy – ESDP – must also be prepared to support border control between the Moldovan separatist region of Transnistria and Ukraine .
We do not want Johannesburg , as I have said , to be a further disappointment of the type we saw in Durban and we are , therefore , willing to work on this and are doing so with the satisfaction and the relief that we enjoy the political support of this Parliament that has been expressed so forcefully in today &apos;s sitting .
I have been asked to adopt Dmitry Bandarenka .
Mr Pittella also submitted an extremely important report to us ; I would therefore like to thank the three rapporteurs for the genuinely constructive cooperation which has accompanied the budgetary procedure this year .
If we wish to become a communicating Parliament , we must find our space , we must find our time , we must get our message across , have our story , tell our story , sell our story .
Finally , we need to make sure the interinstitutional agreement on better lawmaking is complied with .
Is there a member of the PPE @-@ DE who would like to speak on this subject ?
Another tangible proposal is to name streets or squares in our cities after Neda Agha @-@ Soltan .
It is a central issue , because it is the political criterion .
Commissioner , you have spoken about subsidiarity with respect to this very matter .
This is where I should like to focus your attention , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , because Europe has clearly started slipping behind recently , especially in biotechnology , in comparison with the United States and Japan .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - Madam President , our Neighbourhood Policy is able , to a large extent , to provide financial assistance to countries in our neighbourhood which are in trouble , so I am very happy that Members of Parliament so unanimously supported this Commission proposal .
The Commission should be very alert to other types of current speculation , such as the speculation on the stock markets .
( PL ) Mr President , I would like to take the opportunity provided by this debate to draw attention to just two issues linked to the so @-@ called climate package .
Do you reject this same idea for European coal ?
These choices are what gives Europe its identity .
To leave unused or squander unnecessarily the resources available would be a terrible shame , and it is therefore right to adopt with urgency a results @-@ oriented approach through the establishment of clear and measurable targets and outcome indicators .
Mr President , the relationship with our Mediterranean partners is one of interdependence .
That being so , Mr Barroso , I urge you and your Commission to get back to supporting and reinforcing the European model of social and economic policy .
That surprised me , in view of his initial remarks .
We are in favour of pre @-@ registration and prioritisation as standard .
Academic science has shown that the notion that objectivity can be equated with masculinity is a myth .
Mr President , we welcome the fact that the report recognises and accepts that Echelon exists .
As far as the proposal to tax European taxpayers is concerned , my response is &apos; No tax in Europe ! &apos;
Health is an inseparable condition for wellbeing and economic development , and I believe it is our moral duty to help less well developed countries in this respect .
13 .
This was not my idea but the idea of Whitfield Primary School in Dundee , Scotland .
I should like to note , on the question of the financial perspective , that the Commission proposes , following the European Parliament &apos; s petition and demand , to include expenditure for promoting Cyprus and Malta under enlargement expenditure in the future , i.e. under the heading of Category 7 .
Otherwise , you will simply be making it impossible for our farmers to compete .
It is possible that we will conclude that there is a real case for enhancing the current framework , which relies essentially on the vigilance of the financial institutions that are themselves under supervision as regards their counterparty risks on the hedge funds .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , thank you all for very interesting contributions , especially the introductory exposé of Klaus @-@ Heiner Lehne .
After lengthy and laborious negotiations , the Council has achieved conciliation on the &apos; third way &apos; .
That is absolutely unacceptable .
As I read my Bible each day one of the things I have found out is that so much of what appears in the Bible coincides with common sense .
We agree that , because of the symbolic value of the award , as a factor that contributes to European unification , transnational sites need to be favoured , because they support cohesion , promote the creation of networks and encourage cooperation between Member States or regions .
They , too , said , ‘ What ?
We should remember that at the moment , within the limits of the money available to us in the financial perspectives , we could raise a further ECU 10b for next year &apos;s budget .
As far as I am concerned , however , this issue has not been voted on at all since many Members were unable to participate in the voting .
Finally , I would like to emphasise how important the proposed changes and the transparency of the guidelines are for thousands of Polish citizens who are living and working outside of Poland .
When I visited some of those countries that wish to accede , in preparation for the UK Presidency , I raised those issues with them .
I should like to briefly mention the question of Austria .
On the basis of the full information provided in the answer the Commission may decide to raise no objection to the aid or it may decide to raise no objection to the aid or it may decide to open proceedings under Article 93 ( 2 ) because of doubts or because of lack of information .
Recent arrests , not only of politicians , but also of journalists , trade union leaders and other members of civil society , bear witness to a worsening situation in terms of civil and political freedoms in that country .
This , then , is a series of measures which , in my view , fall within a broader process to cut red tape which is helpful for European enterprises , especially at such a critical economic juncture .
Animal ethics is about much more than mere rules .
My only reservation is that the bureaucratization heralded in the report will only prevent this .
We need to have subsidiarity here so that some countries may go ahead and continue to pay them .
Thirty @-@ seven people were shot and injured by plastic bullets .
The directive and , in particular Article 3 ( 2 ) , does not oblige a Member State to change the legal nature of collective agreements .
In other words , policy should be implemented along the lines of a directive rather than a regulation .
It will be an important time for clarifying the close relationship between the management of migratory flows and employment policy at European level , as Mr Watson highlighted so clearly .
Mr President , I want to make a point of order that is a matter of form and will take only a moment .
I am looking forward to the cooperation within this framework .
Our financial assistance is comprehensive .
I am convinced that this objective concerns industry most of all , manufacturing industry in particular , because the industrial base is the backbone , the economic engine for growth in the European Union .
It will deliver security and fluidity in air transport at European and world level , and improve the functioning of the market , competitiveness , environmental impact management and European cohesion .
in writing . - ( FR ) It is a known fact that Europe wants to take care of everything and be everywhere .
Naturally , this approach also goes for the actions of the united Europe in its relations with other countries , in particular the developing countries .
That is why , for reasons of solidarity as well as our own safety , it is imperative for us to contribute and expand our practical help and know @-@ how regarding accident prevention .
You even want to increase the scope of the bail @-@ out fund so that , along with the ECB , you , too , can go on buying yet more of your own debt .
However , especially since President Putin came to office , Russia has responded by seeking to partly distance itself from Belarus .
I understand politicians &apos; fears regarding rising unemployment levels in certain areas but I am sure that it would be very unwise to rely solely on injections of funding into a single sector , as this simply postpones the day of reckoning , often at the expense of those that are operating in a sensible way .
As the President has also been able to transfer funds for this purpose , altogether at this stage we can use around EUR 58 million for accelerated payments , which will lessen annual payments over the ten @-@ year period by around EUR 8 to 9 million for Parliament , which is a great relief .
I wonder whether we could consider having a birthday party for the question on its 21st anniversary when it comes of age , because it appears to be proceeding exceedingly slowly .
The Intergovernmental Conference is preparing the new Treaty with constitutional aspirations that will have enormous repercussions for the future of European citizens .
Finally , the Commission attaches great importance to establishing fair competition at international level .
But if it is not possible to change the date of the debates , let us hold it now , in a clandestine manner – that will be the responsibility of those who do not want to seek an agreement in this regard .
Mr Mulder , I am most surprised to hear you now call for subsidies to be introduced in this prosperous market even though everybody says we have to dismantle subsidies !
Before , our neighbours could obtain free or reduced @-@ price visas to travel to many new Schengen countries .
The EU &apos;s plans for the climate would fall like a house of cards .
The rapporteur very realistically dealt with the limited financial resources and their desired commitment , and the need to use them better ; she also dealt with the subject of bureaucratic streamlining , cofinancing and , in particular , the reallocation of budgets ; a gradual , rigorous procedure was provided for ; aware that this paragraph might create problems in some countries , including my own .
I would therefore ask that all EU Member States ratify this convention against trafficking , and that everyone here , including all the members of the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights , take it upon themselves to go back to their governments and push them to do even more work than they may already be doing about the whole vile and evil trade of trafficking in women .
I refer to the abolition of internal border controls and to the elimination of all administrative barriers to settling and taking up work anywhere in the territory of the entire Union .
I understand that economic growth is projected to be 2.3 % in the European Union and 2.1 % in the euro area in 2006 , up from 1.6 % and 1.3 % respectively in 2005 .
I will be addressing these issues in the debate on the Fernández @-@ Albor report immediately after this debate .
That is something we should also do in other institutions , and I believe that it is something that we really should take seriously - also in Parliament .
Parliament has done well .
Although floods are a natural phenomenon , human activity can either exacerbate the risks or mitigate the effects .
It is becoming more and more important for us to come up with our own ideas on what future prospects we want to give the Internet sector as a whole .
Mr President , the Sinhalese and the Tamils have lived together in Sri Lanka – also known as Ceylon – for over two thousand years .
As Mr Esteve himself stated , it is the only issue on which all those in the Mediterranean area agree . It may represent the only remaining window of opportunity for Arab and Israeli delegations to engage in productive dialogue along with European delegations .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on the eve of the referendum in France , the UMP swore that the Bolkestein directive had been withdrawn , and the socialists said that it had been consigned to the dustbin of history .
This is extremely regrettable because it will give third @-@ party creditors the opportunity to gain access to the general resources as a result , which will mean that mortgages ordered abroad for the benefit of the bank will no longer be competitive .
In this context , the Commission has suggested the possibility of granting more financial aid , specifically up to 20 % of the priority energy network projects .
The United Nations mission in Guatemala has the express task of ensuring respect for human rights there , and I believe it is important to highlight the fact that Guatemala forms part of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights .
Mr President , I should like to thank all the rapporteurs for the work that has gone into producing the reports that we are discussing today , which repeatedly stress the fact that upholding and promoting human rights is the most important and best strategy for preventing and fighting terror .
I believe , though , that where we have to exert more influence is on the issue of what must be done to make Europe more competitive .
I am pleased about this .
There will , no doubt , be more general lessons to be drawn by Parliament itself , by the Member States and by the Commission when it comes to regulating and monitoring the decisions that are taken .
I propose that you either vote on my amendment before voting on Amendment No 3 or hold a split vote and vote separately on the part of the sentence reading &apos; as soon as the basic conditions are fulfilled &apos; .
It is extremely difficult to implement what the European Parliament is proposing with gender mainstreaming , which I would translate into French as transversalité .
It has acted quickly , but also erratically .
We are hopeful that progress can be extended to other tracks in due course .
. I welcome the renewal of the Agreement on scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the Government of the United States of America , which was adopted by the Council in its decision of 13 October 1998 , and which entered into force on 14 October 1998 .
We need a more active labour market policy and one which covers many areas .
It took some time to reach agreement with the Commission about where this programme should be implemented , but eventually it was decided to give it to the agency in Bilbao . That , of course , is no fault of the agency in Bilbao , but nevertheless the Court of Auditors made a very negative comment about this .
Nor do we have any information on substitutes to plasticisers which might have toxic or chronic effects .
It must also move more quickly in its cohesion aims .
Last minute changes are made to the agenda but there is nothing secret about this . It is just difficult to communicate these changes when we ourselves only know that urgent facts have come up a few minutes before the start of the meeting .
Member of the Commission . - ( EL ) Madam President , first I all , I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Wallis , and the draftsmen of the opinions , Mr Martin , Mr Brepoels and Mrs Mathieu , for their exceptional work .
For a long time we will pay a huge cost for this while certain capitalist countries will earn huge profits .
The Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats is therefore calling for the implementation of a Community instrument which can be mobilised almost automatically during these periods of crisis .
But I think we need , as the World Bank says , to invest again in agriculture and food production , and we need to do that through women .
Just now an extremely serious incident occurred , which significantly disrupted the vote on Mr Cornelissen &apos;s report .
Europe must not remain passive in the face of developments in Central Africa .
I welcome in particular the Commission ’ s decision this week to mount legal challenges to those flouting the rules of liberalisation , because that is the kind of action that we need from the Commission to make progress .
On the test of internal stability , with inflation at less that 2 % and growth higher at 3.1 % in the euro zone than in Britain , the euro is clearly succeeding .
Today , though , nearly two years after the onset of this crisis , we have to say that we are facing failure , as none of the aims that were set have been fulfilled , and I am not talking about weapons of mass destruction .
Composition of Parliament : see Minutes
The Barcelona Summit decided on a study of what are termed the Basle II effects on small and medium @-@ sized enterprises and banks .
Anyone who wants Russia on their side , wherever they may be , had better not make any false moves over Kaliningrad .
We should provide an opportunity , we should talk , however much the other side digs its heels in .
Above all , Israel must contribute to the credible peace process which Palestinian leaders such as President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayad are working to develop .
The regulation cannot now be interpreted in any way as implying limitations or interference in the exercise of these fundamental rights .
You have the floor , Mr President .
( The sitting was suspended at 11.50 a.m. and resumed at 12.05 p.m. )
As emphasized in the texts approved at the Council meetings of 1 @-@ 3 April and 29 @-@ 30 April , the priority has been to ensure a high level of health protection on the basis of the available scientific data .
Europe needs the introduction of economic governance as soon as possible .
I should therefore like to address two points on which I would be grateful for the backing of other committees , especially the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control .
She is right that a majority in the Conference of Presidents voted to have the report on during the night sitting ; she is wrong to suggest that the majority of groups shared her view that it was somehow inopportune for the subject to be discussed in view of certain changes in Member States .
Madam President , firstly I would like to congratulate Ms Muscardini on an excellent report .
Experts on issues of church @-@ based development aid , such as my colleague Mr Dess , are doing exemplary work in supporting decentralised projects , by which I mean not flagship projects , but projects which really help people .
However , we should not forget that unregulated competition can also lead to an increase in unemployment , so that the gap between the rich and poor grows ever wider .
But biomass is only one part of a sustainable energy policy and we should not let our concern with biomass make us forget other possibilities , in particular the natural heat of the earth and hot springs , which can make a very major contribution to energy production .
This disaster , the extent of which no one can foresee , has been aggravated by mistakes made at all levels of responsibility : negligence , complaisance towards the British government , concealment of facts to Parliament , unacceptable pressure on the latter .
It affects freedom of religion , minority rights , equal opportunities ( for women in particular ) , corruption , Kurdish and Cyprus issues and of course also the power of the army over government policies .
The number of Serbian refugees in the Republika Srpska ( Bosnia and Herzegovina ) has remained relatively stable for several years ( between 25,000 and 35,000 persons ) .
Propose a President at Laeken and let the Convention elect the President .
Six : we need a humane model which is not based on information overload and which can be combined with pupils &apos; need for free time , with cultivating the imagination , with creativity in all sectors and with developing social conduct in school .
Such assistance should be directed towards the reconstruction of the infrastructure and public amenities which have been destroyed or damaged and should also be made available to people affected by the various aspects of the tragedy , whether economic , social or in terms of the family .
I have already explained that we began by agreeing with the industry , including the Greek industry , that we had 19 million tonnes of overcapacity .
Although our trade disputes with the US only concern one to two per cent of our trade and investment flows , they can cause a great deal of damage to our mutual relations .
When there was the problem between Russia and Ukraine , President Putin decided to call me specifically to inform me of that problem , and you know just how much time and energy we at the Commission , together with other partners , have put into trying to find a solution to a problem that concerned Russia and Ukraine but which has had consequences for European consumers .
The Council got it wrong .
The extension of majority voting to a range of areas is , in an ever @-@ expanding EU , something to be welcomed .
I am committed to this , just as the Commission is .
To criticise how the requirements are formulated today does not mean that we need not oppose the imposition of conditions for the aid .
What we need is more efficient civil spending which accounts for a higher and probably more significant - by which I also mean materially significant - proportion .
Meanwhile , the motion for a resolution has been amended drastically and the suggestion was made to postpone the discharge decision .
I believe that this is a good time for the leaders of the political groups who wish to do so to speak .
. Given the significance of Mrs Prets &apos; report concerning transnational mobility within the Community for education and training purposes , the British Conservative delegation of the EPP @-@ ED Group will vote in favour of the report .
Therefore , you may wonder why I seek to comment on it now .
You will also be aware that we have received a letter from the Prime Minister of Belgium , the current President of the Council , addressed to the President of the European Parliament , telling us that the representatives of the next four six @-@ month Presidencies have confirmed that they wish to undertake the procedure for developing future financial perspectives in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty .
It is true that we sometimes take a long time to reply .
You must realise that too .
Discussions with the US authorities are under way , but I understand that these authorities want still more .
One of the most important and immediate steps that must be taken is the creation by the Commission of comprehensive transposition guidelines .
Along with some of our colleagues , in spite of certain lobbies , fashions and , above all , caution , he defends the industrial and technological interests of Europe , its research and its appropriations , not to mention the safety of our energy .
Indeed , the investors from the market will readily come to us if there is something to be gained and if barriers are removed .
Commissioner , please allow me firstly to begin more or less at the end : I wish you all the luck in the world at the next ICAO Assembly .
Gahrton report ( A4 @-@ 0047 / 99 )
I am saying what our colleague Bart Staes said a few minutes ago : it is very good that you are present .
We established frameworks for the objectives and the implementation , and we emphasised the role of the European Parliament in following up this issue of road safety .
- Mr President , there is a lot more to mysterious Turkmenistan than just oil and gas .
The report of our monitors confirms that it was technically difficult ( though not impossible ) to ensure the transport under these conditions .
. Mr President , I should like to thank all the participants in this debate for their very interesting points and contributions .
That raises the question of the development model that we want to promote at global level .
Mr President , Austria has very strict laws prohibiting fascism , national socialism and the resurgence thereof , and there has been a succession of convictions over the past few years .
( BG ) The second year of Bulgaria &apos;s membership to the European Union is about to turn fatal for many Bulgarian dairy farmers .
The entry into force of treaties largely depends on the European Union , because thirty ratification acts are required in order for treaties to enter into effect , and these acts that are signed by the European Union and the Member States , including associated countries , are of vital importance in order to reach this number .
One of these has always been for us that goods produced within the European Union must consist of ingredients free of substances that endanger health .
There is a risk of contradictions between establishing the very long @-@ term basis of those kinds of deals and the liberalisation of the gas market inside the Union , to which we would give priority .
In my view , we need to be aware that we have a long road ahead of us : we need to be clear about that , as you have been .
Only if this is made clear are we prepared to agree to this resolution as it stands .
Mr President , the Commissioner will doubtless be aware that a couple of weeks ago the McCann family from my constituency came to the European Parliament .
But it is difficult to draw up regional policy unless there are instruments for territorial cooperation at European level , which transcend those artificial lines that constitute boundaries , and the Interreg initiative has already played an important part in cross @-@ border cooperation , but there is still a great deal to do in that field .
The programme is also intended to include non @-@ EU countries that discharge their waste water and thereby pollute the Baltic Sea , which is considered to be one of the most polluted seas in the world .
The public must always be given a choice when it comes to news dissemination .
Voting will take place during the first part @-@ session in February , in other words during February I.
It is hypocritical to claim that Europe is a pioneer in the area of social responsibility .
It can be seen as a preparation , a part of a link in a new European order .
Nor can I accept the argument that the internal market is distorted by different national soil protection legislation .
However it might be noted that in the present case , thirteen States out of fifteen , in the Council , were in favour of the prohibition on importing transgenic maize and that the Commission had no hesitation in defying that crushing majority to place itself in the ranks of the two lax States , of which , sadly , France was one .
Israeli military action has already cost the lives of over 30 Palestinians , and the situation threatens to escalate still further .
So I would like to ask you , are we going to prohibit trains from passing because they make noise and wake me up ?
I personally always have difficulty when it comes to restricting the rights of the individual .
As regards what Mr Pirker said , it is true that we must ensure that our young people are qualified for the jobs on offer today .
Energy policy ( continuation )
Zappalà report ( A5 @-@ 0378 / 2001 )
I welcome the stated intentions regarding efforts to promote development and stamp out the drug trade , the defence of social justice and the environment , and the restoration of closer cultural links .
The principles on which environmental policy is based are accepted but not implemented .
It was not easy to decide on our tactics .
When one leaves the European Union , it is shocking to experience the paradox that the Union has a strong image from the outside despite having a practically non @-@ existent image from within .
There appears to be a gradually growing consensus that governments alone will not bring universal happiness , and we have allowed free initiative to play a role .
The aim , by undertaking concerted action agreed on the spot , is to identify villages and towns to which the displaced people , at present living in the open air , can return , in safety and with dignity .
These negotiations must lead to the signing of an Association Agreement , marking a significant step in the implementation of European values in this European state in the EU &apos;s immediate vicinity .
( The sitting ended at 10.10 a.m. )
Giving up in the face of such chaos would be the final nail in Haiti ’ s coffin .
I should like to point out that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has approved the proposal , with only one member voting against it .
In addition , the agreement provides for improved cooperation and greater transparency in terms of market data in the fruit and vegetable sector .
The proposals concerning the golden rule should be restored , but with the constraint that investments beyond the 3 % should be set up and managed at Community level and should not deteriorate into a mere market for the interests of the various countries , as Mr Klinz has just said .
We have no news of them .
We will see Prime Minister Fayyad tomorrow .
Rather , Europeans must not only be trailblazers when it comes to the issue of climate change ; we must also encourage others to join us on our journey .
Being an MEP in a region bordering Luxembourg , Belgium and France I can identify with all the facets of these issues .
In previous debates on the spring summit I already said that governments in the Member States should take an active role .
The fight against all forms of cancer is part of this , as this disease is responsible for the deaths of millions of European citizens every year .
I must admit that I was initially sceptical about this amendment .
I would like to raise one matter , which is that the Committee on Budgets has now presented its own budget line for the Baltic Strategy .
Finally , I should say that not only did we secure political commitments but , in parallel , we have been able to differentiate the existing policy .
Although defence and security are clearly intergovernmental matters , I believe that world peace and stability cannot be restricted to one pillar .
To change this state of affairs , we need an integrated and consistent European migration policy .
The draft framework decision before us today tries to cover up this lacuna by referring to Articles 31 and 34 ( 2 ) ( b ) of the Treaty .
I am therefore seeking your assurance that until impact studies have been carried out and the members of Parliament have been informed , this project will not be the covered by an exception .
- The debate is closed .
It is alcohol consumption among these groups that we aim to influence .
Secondly , all these projects have a significant cross @-@ border impact . Finally , we have selected projects that can have a multiplier effect on investment , particularly private investment , but which will have little environmental impact .
It is only by playing an active and committed role in this region that we can contribute to its genuine economic development , social and political stability , and to the establishment of democratic values .
The impression I get from listening to this afternoon &apos;s debate is that we are a very colourful Christmas tree , under which everyone puts their presents , and , seeing their own there , like the rest of the tree as well , but that is not how Europe functions internally , and nor is it going to be successfully sold to the outside world on that basis .
They may seem like a kind gesture , but these matters are better dealt with by the Member States .
I will say that , with regard to the Council , the Presidency cannot have a position , although I believe Mrs Díez González is well aware of the Spanish Government &apos;s position on this matter .
Why ?
I am now delighted to hear that , this weekend , Mr Javier Solana is to call the interior ministers together to discuss the question of policing .
Mr President , despite its deficiencies , I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution , because it condemns the irresponsibility of the Commission which , unilaterally , took the decision to authorise the marketing of genetically modified maize in spite of the negative opinion of the very great majority of the Member States and the European Parliament .
I listened carefully to what they had to say .
I can only reiterate that we are not now dealing with competing conceptions , but with a White Paper in the drafting of which OLAF played a part .
Is it the host country or the home country that determines what is meant by &apos; insignificant &apos; ?
We do not yet have all the facts by a long way , but we have a few .
Ireland &apos;s recent economic performance highlights what can be done if social partners and government pursue consistent and stable macroeconomic policies building on social consensus .
The acting President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mrs Siimes , has the floor .
These reports have , unfortunately , become a ritual in the service of a radical and sectarian ideological agenda .
When will this Parliament start listening to its citizens ?
Quotas should be allocated to producing countries , not to importing companies .
There are no logistics in place for either and no results from the possible application of this testing , including in Great Britain , have been submitted .
This will help reduce dependence on external aid and boost domestic economic growth .
How can we go round saying to small businesses , &apos; participate in the internal market &apos; , if we cannot even give them the simplest of safeguards on a simple act like this ?
Legislative proposals are being considered by the Commission to amend and update the core legislative text on free movement of workers .
I would like to do that now , in order to leave time for the debate later . This aspect , found in the Single Market Act , relates to 17 % of the European economy , namely , public procurement and public contracts .
Even in the presence of a founding father of the European Constitution such as Mr Brok , I would venture to say that the Constitution is currently at a standstill .
We want a political Europe , a Europe of values , a Europe of the people , a Europe of subsidiarity , a Europe of solidarity and a Europe of freedom .
I should like to conclude with one final observation .
Nevertheless — and you have mentioned this as well — I am concerned about the possible tensions that may arise between those negotiations and the Doha Round negotiations , which I believe to be the Union ’ s main priority in terms of its trade policy , particularly with a view to the Ministerial Conferences in Hong Kong in December of this year .
- I would add that the agreement allows for the option of increasing the financial compensation paid by the EC depending on catch volumes .
In some Member States laws make it more difficult , or even impossible , for certain disabled people to vote .
On the subject of hedge funds , we base our views on the principle that their activity has to be regulated .
We are the biggest investor in that region .
I should particularly like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt , for the vigour she has shown in her approach to this matter - many of her proposals deserve agreement .
That cannot be .
The legislation already in force is adequate to safeguard security of supply .
In Europe , we must now , therefore , allow the authorities of the Member States to get on with their work so that farmers can regain the total confidence of consumers , whilst , within the Union , resolutely making the necessary efforts to provide real traceability .
It has absolutely nothing to deliver in this regard .
I also find unfair the suggestion that we have done too little , too late .
This is a major and complex issue with a great deal at stake in the long term and our democracies have an important responsibility to assume for it .
I would also like to express my thanks to all of my fellow Members .
It is a pity that the conservatives were unwilling to support some of the more ambitious proposals , but the adoption of this report nevertheless constitutes a clear call to make ecological considerations an integral part of our economy .
All the measures relating to safety within all European ports must be harmonised so as to better protect maritime transport and prevent unfair competition from harming those ports which actually have to incur greater expense in order to guarantee a higher level of safety .
Therefore Commissioner , I would ask you to expand somewhat , on behalf of the Commission , with regard to your concerns .
On the basis of inter @-@ sectoral partnerships between businesses , organisations and institutions , it would be possible to set up bases , special units and offices with funds , storage space , volunteers , food , essential materials and equipment and means of transport .

DecaBDE is a bio @-@ accumulative chemical product , which has been found in breast milk and for which the relative European Scientific Committee has recommended that the risk be reduced even further .
However , we also have some criticisms . We should point out that we do not endorse some of the conclusions drawn by the rapporteur , such as the overly negative assessment of the Structural Fund results during the planning period and the failure to meet the regional policy objective of harmonising living conditions , which has supposedly only been achieved in part .
Mr President , I would like to compliment Mr Meier on his report on an important matter which is barely recognised as important by many .
That concludes the vote .
The EU and the Member States have already committed themselves to a substantial increase in their development aid at the European Council meeting in Barcelona in March of this year .
Finally , I would like to end my speech by congratulating the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , who has just become a mother and has worked very hard and also helped to make this agreement a success .
President Santer and Mrs Bonino - and , incidentally , we are very glad that Mrs Bonino is now in charge of an essential part of the department in question , in accordance with the structural reform we wanted - responded favourably yesterday to some of our questions regarding major points in Mr Medina &apos;s excellent report .
Obviously no country which violates human rights can join the Union .
report ( A5 @-@ 0353 / 2002 ) by Mr Herzog , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the 2001 scoreboard for state aid ( spring 2002 update ) &#91; 2001 / 2196 ( INI ) &#93; .
As regards the partnership with the USA , the Summit with this country follows the European Council , and preparations will also have to be made for this .
The EU will therefore fund initiatives that genuinely provide objective , factual , fair and independent information .
So , Commissioner , I would like to alert you to a third concern of ours .
Dates for next sittings : see Minutes
I therefore call for greater and more meaningful coordination between the Structural Fund initiatives , with particular reference to the ESF , and more tangible compatibility not only with the longstanding annual horizontal themes - for example the SMEs - but also with new solutions .
These events show that the Taliban regime and the terrorist networks are gradually losing control of Afghanistan .
Ladies and gentlemen , Maria Berger has given a comprehensive report on experience with the 1985 architects &apos; directive , and has said everything that needs to be said about it .
While the Community and national authorities act with such a lack of determination and coordination in addressing a crime of this magnitude , countless cases have come to light , in which , under discretionary powers granted in the cause of recovering Community funds , the authorities have hounded honest farmers to return money , without any substantive justification and for procedural reasons that are not always genuine , and this has often left the farmers in a state of poverty .
Certainly , I do not share the fear of some Members of the House and of the consumer associations that we are ignoring the general public .
We have to declare in explicit language that Saddam Hussein &apos;s regime depends for its existence upon a secret service , upon violence , murder and terror .
These elections on Sunday must be free and fair , and people must have access to information .
Subject : European Union measures to combat paedophilia
I wish , for the sake of the citizens of Sri Lanka , that an expression which I have heard time and again - &apos; war is an institution &apos; - will finally be consigned to the past .
It seems to me that the tool currently available to us to make citizenship come alive is the Charter .
Otherwise a country which murders its trade unionists will continue to appear to be rewarded for doing so .
It is an illegal decision , because the final status of East Jerusalem will have to be discussed during the third stage of negotiations , and because both sides have undertaken to refrain from any action that might change the situation on the ground .
Madam President , I have five proposals here , and in part they are legislative ones , so this might unfortunately take somewhat longer than the ten minutes remaining .
I hear again and again from the trade unions that , in the area of wage settlement , the autonomy of the Member States and their social partners is being harmed and that we are possibly heading for a flagrant violation of the regulation of competencies under the Treaty .
Since Thursday , when I addressed the Member States , we have been seeing support coming through , but more is needed in terms of healthcare professionals , water purification tablets and support for an awareness campaign , because - as many here have said - there is widespread misunderstanding of what this disease is and how it can best be treated .
For the above reasons , I voted for this report .
Quite frankly , the way the negotiations have been conducted , especially by Mrs Theorin , has caused some resentment and unnecessary friction with regard to this report .
The proposed coordination may help ensure the more efficient use of resources , especially at a time when budget cuts are being made , particularly in the cultural sector .
GM citizenship may be for some ; it is not for me .
In these terms too , in my view , we managed to formulate a very clear position on the most essential issues .
We need more research in this field and we need to guarantee the long @-@ term safety of storage or disposal of these materials .
The European Social Fund must remain part of the Structural Funds , especially as it has proven its effectiveness in every region of Europe , given that it is actually a key weapon in the battle against the economic crisis , in addition to the European Regional Development Fund .
&lt; empty &gt;
You have to take that on board too when you deal with the chicken meat .
The initiative we are debating today came of course from the US parliament - or , rather , Congress - and I therefore think that all Mrs Mann &apos;s observations were particularly relevant .
Parliament has done , is doing and will do everything in its power .
We must be able to confiscate the financial proceeds of terrorism so as to help cut off the money supply which is the financial oxygen for its evil operations .
So be it . But as responsible politicians , we must be careful not to draw the conclusion that we , for this reason , should be less ambitious in the future .
This is what these own @-@ initiative reports seek to do and to coordinate .
In a recent UK study of more than 1000 CEOs commissioned by the think @-@ tank Open Europe , a clear majority felt that the EU was doing more harm than good and that Britain should renegotiate its relationship with Europe to something more like a free- trade deal .
We await the European Parliament &apos;s first reading on the directive and are aiming for a common position at the April Consumer Council .
We have to accept that there were shortcomings in the way that the Constitutional project was presented , even if the difficulties concerned were really more a matter of form than of substance .
Moreover , according to a major charity , tax evasion by the super @-@ rich and by global corporations has a severe impact on the lives of more than five million children in the developing world .
Climate targets must be increased to the levels called for by scientists and special programmes must be designed for countries with economic problems .
However , the starting point for this principle should not be the financial services directive itself .
Furthermore , in cooperation with a number of other countries , the EU submitted a declaration to continue working on this issue .
A plane crash , for example , is similarly tragic , but I do not believe that this provides sufficient reason for us to have doubts about the benefit and safety of planes .
The new Hungarian elite has reclaimed the 1956 revolution and the communist symbols in order to justify liberalism .
We , as representatives and Members of the European Parliament , want to , and must , insist on having codecision powers and on participating in dealing with these issues .
Fair competition is one of the basic pillars of the internal market , and we can never do enough to ensure it .
It has also shown that the Nation @-@ State is the appropriate and effective level for decision , action and reaction , even if Mr Sarkozy felt he had to be accompanied everywhere by Mr Barroso to make people believe that the European Union was useful in this situation .
First of all , I have some questions for the Commissioner .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Liberal Group is quite happy with the outcome of the conciliation procedure , except for one point with which none of the Parliament delegation agreed , namely the size of the budget .
A link across the Fehmarn Belt is an exciting , rather than a frightening project .
At the first reading in 2005 , Mr Sterckx said that we must not tinker with international agreements that are already satisfactory .
I am pleased that you have written to Mr Seehofer to question him about his actions .
Mr President , a lot of interesting things have been said here this evening .
I appeal to you , ladies and gentlemen , not to vote in favour of the proposal tomorrow to moderate the contents of point 4 , to prevent gender democracy from being discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference .
However , the little which is being given may relieve their hardship .
It does not sit well with the cold and detached laws of the market .
I also believe that the EU should lead efforts in the use of bilateral free trade so that this incorporates not only provisions on human rights , but also provisions on sustainable development issues .
We should prioritize energy @-@ saving , environmentally @-@ friendly , sustainable means of transport .
I wish him well in his office and promise my cooperation and that of my Group in his work in the coming months .
The Commission cannot accept Amendments 2 , 3 , 6 , 19 , 22 , 32 , 35 , 36 , 38 , 41 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 50 , 52 , 54 , 59 , 62 , 63 , 69 , 70 , 71 , 74 , 75 , 76 , 80 , 83 , 85 , 86 , 87 , 88 and 90 .
In addition , it is our view that all the EU instruments covering environmental impact assessments should have the same legal basis .
That is the only route to take .
21 million people are unable to benefit from the information , expertise and experience of the World Health Organization .
This sows the seed for the famous American policy of &apos; positive discrimination &apos; which is nowadays much disputed , even in the USA .
Secondly , everything that happens in Europe takes place in the context of the treaties .
Since Maastricht , we have had co @-@ decision in these matters .

The Council hopes that this meeting will lead to a resumption of political dialogue and progress towards an agreed solution .

We cannot conceal our reticence over emissions trading and its monitoring or the use of sinks .
The entire European Parliament has worked on the Seventh Framework Programme .
This report also addresses the fact that the society of the future will be a mobile Internet society , and I believe that we Members are , in a way , guinea pigs as regards whether or not this mobility will work .
In the light of the above , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Bendtsen , for the excellent work carried out and for the balance achieved , and would invite all of you to support this important report .
This is extremely disturbing , because the issue of freedom of speech and civil liberties is one of the most important things which constitute us as the European Union .
As far as the size of the total budget is concerned , there cannot be a lot of discussion .
Not only is the development sector not being used as a tool to address the problems but , in certain instances , the funds are operating in pre @-@ crisis conditions .
Now , though , I have two practical observations on Mr Glante &apos;s report . I consider it essential that industry should today already be actively involved in Galileo .
And the main task of the network will be the exchange of knowledge and experience , as well as technical assistance to Member States in creating methodologies for evaluation .
Furthermore , while this is an extremely beneficial step for citizens and for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises trading in the euro zone , the limit of EUR 12 500 per transaction is ridiculous and unjustifiable .
I prefer the Commission &apos;s proposal of 18 weeks .
We condemn anyone who uses violence to subvert political processes .
In Vietnam , outspoken Buddhist monks and Catholics are not tolerated by the Hanoi Government , and in Laos the Hmong people are persecuted , and many have fled to Thailand .
Clearly , however , these reserves , together with the interest accruing on them , should be used to finance Community steel research programmes and be subject to adequate controls , once the levies on the steel industry have been ended .
I also thank Commissioner Dimas .
It may well be pointed out in this context that , under the terms of Article 93 ( 2 ) of the EC Treaty , the Council may decide in exceptional circumstances , on application by a Member State , that aid granted by a state shall be considered to be compatible with the common market .
Let us take advantage of this opportunity to sound the alarm and increase everyone &apos;s awareness of environmental protection issues .
Special thanks are also due to the President of Parliament , Mr Buzek , for visiting the affected areas of Moravia together with us , and personally backing support for the Czech Republic .
You are aware of the letter that I wrote to all of the Member States in November asking for information about the conditions under which their banks use personal data through SWIFT .
The way in which it is to be achieved is quite flexible .
All world economic development must be geared to satisfying the fundamental and basic needs of food , shelter and health care in these various countries .
Effective medicines must get quickly to the people who need them .
As for gender equality in business , attention should be drawn to the fact that only 3 % of companies are chaired by women , because they face discrimination and obstacles preventing them from climbing the career ladder and pursuing leadership .
All our mechanisms in the EU for ensuring that human rights standards are respected are frankly inadequate : no peer review , no monitoring , no enforcement .
The euro needs institutions and policies that accept the need to devote some time to it .
A whole series of measures are put forward .
We must bear in mind that in the last three financial years very high payments were not used .
I would point out some of the successes achieved in the areas of nature , the environment and third countries since LIFE was first set up , in 1992 .
The legal advisers of the USA ’ s state department and of the EU ’ s equivalent services are discussing better ways of protecting human rights in the fight against terrorism , as the common search to improve the protection of human rights is important .
Mr President , I would like to announce the following . I reached an agreement with the shadows on my oral amendment to paragraph 18 .
( RO ) Although women account for more than 55 % of university graduates , we still fail to find them in management positions in public institutions or often not in businesses either .
&lt; empty &gt;
Can I take you deeper into the question of identifying whether ethnic minorities are actually being targeted properly ?
Development of genetic modification by technology has generally brought about the need for this directive and whilst public acceptance and the obvious usefulness of the beneficial effects of biotechnology in other sectors like medicine and pharmaceuticals is now clear , this is not immediately the case when it comes to plant and animal biotechnology or genetically engineered food .
In my introductory remarks , I shall first review the economic and monetary developments in 2004 and set out our view of our economic prospects and of the monetary policy strategy .
Composition of Parliament : see Minutes
The constructive involvement of Parliament &apos; s Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , and Committee on Budgets also deserves thanks , and I will in a moment comment on the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets about which Mr Khanbhai spoke .
B5 @-@ 0766 / 2001 by Gröner , Theorin , van den Berg and Izquierdo Rojo , on behalf of the PSE Group ,
All this will be included in the powerful message which , we trust , will be sent out from the Naples Conference .
Although the Council did not include any of the amendments contained in the Commission &apos;s amended proposal in its common position , the Commission noted during the discussions that there was a positive attitude in the Council towards considering these amendments after the second reading in Parliament , as the rapporteur and a number of other speakers have pointed out .
The report does not mention the fact - although this will have to be specified in the future - that over the last forty years , the governments of all the Member States have squandered and dissipated the capital entrusted to them by workers for their pensions .
I can therefore only emphasise the need for the Commission to defend the worldwide recognition of regional products grown in Europe and the ban on their being grown elsewhere under the same name .
In celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the existence of the Customs Union it is worth noting that this is an excellent example , that it is possible to work effectively within a community of 27 Member States since , after all , there is not just one customs authority for the European Union , but there are 20 national customs authorities with differing areas of responsibility and various types of organisation that work together on the basis of a joint European policy and within the legal framework that sets out the relevant regulations and procedures .
Mr President , I have just three points to make . Firstly , I support a water policy which promotes the rational use of water by encouraging rational control of its demand and discouraging irrational increases in its supply .
This is a grass @-@ roots vision that represents a fundamental contribution to the European social model .
It is wrong that contributions to Members in the form of staff or equipment provided on top of the generous secretarial allowance we receive today from Parliament should be permitted .
In these circumstances , the Council ultimately becomes intransigent and adopts a position that always implies : either you do what we say or the law will not be adopted .
The debate must therefore be held , and decisions on the debate must be taken not only in Parliament but also among the citizens .
In addition , a ceiling ensures that eventually the fairly closed markets for classification and statutory tasks will become more open and a more level playing field will be created .
It isolates woman from social life and the labour market .
We are dealing with an ever more hard @-@ line dictatorship in Serbia .
So why is this important ?
That is because , in this first part @-@ session of 1999 , this subject is still current , and because the economic situation is unlikely to stabilise .
This is the real way to avoid a similar situation to the one we have now .
in writing . - ( EL ) I have supported the Florenz report on the Green Paper &apos; Towards a Europe free from tobacco smoke &apos; .
It is understood that these initiatives in themselves will not be able to deal specifically with the problem of alcopops .
Now we finally need political agreement within the Council .
Secondly , Council decisions must be made by qualified majority in the case of a partial suspension of the Convention , and unanimously in the case of a full suspension .
Such work should actually be directed at achieving the objectives , increasing production and the number of jobs .
The debate is closed .
The British and Germans have just made some steps in that direction by exchanging diplomatic employees .
Thank you , Commissioner de Palacio .
Reaching agreement by next April is essential .
First of all , in general terms , we should stop selecting the States with which we conclude cooperation agreements on the basis of highly subjective criteria founded on political and humanitarian views and , far too often , on the dictates , it must be said , of US policy .
Financial instrument for the environment ( LIFE )
The prize is such an important signal for us because we understand our problems , but they are not just a matter of upholding our own professional principles .
A number of defined benefit pension schemes took advantage of the 1990s bull market to reduce the level of contributions or even take contribution holidays instead of building up their financial reserves .
In accordance with article 12 of the Act concerning the election of representatives to the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage , the house recognizes this vacancy and informs the Member State concerned of its existence .
( DE ) Madam President , I have a question for Mr Chatzimarkakis , if he will allow me to ask it .
The reality of the EPAs negotiated by the European Commission is so tragic that they failed even before they came into force .
In changing the number of members in Parliament we must also remember that the small states , too , need parliamentary representation , as the most important principle of the Union is solidarity .
The Commission &apos;s proposed legislative programme for 2007 shows in stark relief how the lack of political leadership in many Member States is complicating matters for the EU .
Ultimately , the result is a highly inflexible schematic approach , partly @-@ privatised universities , that would make it possible to plan educational output .
Similarly , how could one fail to see the link between the fight against terrorism - which we support - and the dangers represented by illegal immigration , which is the breeding ground for terrorism ?
Turkey has not recommenced work on a new secular constitution , an important element of which was supposed to be protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms which the Turkish government was going to guarantee .
The committee gives its unreserved support to the Commission &apos;s proposal that the programme be proceeded with for a further five years .
The Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs has decided to apply the procedure without report to that proposal . I shall give the floor immediately to Mr Watson , who is Chairman of that committee , to give us its opinion .
My vote was motivated by the fact that this report , which is aimed at organising the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities , would have actually had the effect of excluding selfemployed drivers from the scope of European legislation on the organisation of working time .
While today , the European Commission is presenting its flagship initiative - a European Platform against Poverty and Exclusion - this declaration sends a strong message from Parliament to the European Commission and Member States .
And if not , why not ?
( Applause from the right )
What I would like to know is what will happen to the draft Charter that the Convention draws up ?
The common objective and intention to develop the internal market has nevertheless remained unchanged .
The quality of Irish beef is renowned .
After all , it is they who have had to spend large amounts of money on bailing out the banks .
I fear that that is already now the case .
The recent and on @-@ going crises in the Scottish salmon industry as a result of the infectious salmon anaemia virus demonstrates more than amply that the aquaculture sector can also be volatile and unpredictable .
All intervention by neighbouring and other countries must therefore cease .
That is just dissembling , since the reality is that the EU Council &apos;s agreement to improve economic EU gouvernement means the action of ruling and directing the affairs of a state .
I think you said that this would not be the case , which is a shame .
I voted in favour of the motion for a joint resolution on the continuation of the informal European Council of 11 February 2010 . To achieve a social market economy which is sustainable , more intelligent and greener , Europe must define its priorities , agreeing on these together .
In this case , Italy unfortunately offers a bad example of waste management , failing to respect the spirit and the letter of European law under which a virtuous hierarchy , ranging from reduction to recycling , has for some time been consolidated .
The Council continues to act in accordance with the terms of the July declaration whereby the financial perspective should be negotiated in a spirit of loyal institutional cooperation , with the institutions willing to take all measures necessary for successful completion of the procedure leading to its adoption .
However , I must emphasise , as Mr Liese has said , that the competences available to us at European Union level in respect of public health issues are quite limited .
The Constitution will significantly reinforce that democracy by extending codecision , by giving Parliament the right to elect the President of the Commission and by improving parliamentary control over the Commission and the so @-@ called comitology system for delegated secondary legislation .
I call upon the European Parliament this afternoon to join with Amnesty International in recognizing these men as prisoners of conscience and agitating for their immediate release .
The European Union &apos;s attempt to reduce the use of coal is only right and proper .
As it seeks to achieve the introduction of this global moratorium , the European Union is unable to offer countries ravaged by violence any significant aid in the area of public security .
For our industry or agriculture to survive they have to be cost @-@ effective .
Taylor was indicted for war crimes by this court in 2003 , but Nigeria is refusing to extradite him , claiming he has sovereign immunity and benefits from the asylum deal they agreed to .
I would point out also that the tension surrounding the latest summit involves much more than relations between the Union and Russia , and how that is resolved will determine the standing and future of the whole Union .
All this gives rise to hope and concern : hope in the work of the Italian presidency ; concern at the existing problems and the UK Government &apos;s blocking of the Community process .
We are voting on the draft presented to us by the Council , with no changes , because this draft is exactly the same as the position which the Committee on Budgets adopted last week .
Adopting this report will allow Member States to take coordinated measures to combat this disease in the European Union .
Furthermore , because of the resumption of hostilities , the UN has even been forced to delay sending humanitarian assistance to the region .
The Treaty of Amsterdam , Mr President , has set the number of European Parliament Members at 700 and a debate is needed in this Parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged Europe .
Isolated genetic information would be regarded as the result of technical processes and thus as inventions which could be patented .
This way we will achieve lasting emission cuts and not the sort that have to be bought again every year from abroad .
Of course we are considering the industry &apos;s interests .
Finally , we have to give Haiti the resources to emerge from the dependency that was already undermining it even before the earthquake .
Such agreements make sense if they can be used to save employment , to keep manufacturing locations and to make the car industry more competitive .
We think that the measures aimed at strengthening the controls exercised by national parliaments should remain principally the responsibility of those parliaments and that they can help to fulfil their role within the European Union with greater effectiveness .
This surcharge on services that are so essential is proving to be a financial burden on families , especially those in the lower income bracket , and is giving rise to extra costs for companies - a development that in turn is putting pressure on the cost of living .
Finally , at international level , the European Union has shown itself unable to make a positive contribution to resolving conflicts , notably by imposing a just and lasting peace in Palestine on Israel .
Otherwise what we put in before was also a linguistic correction .
There ought to be experts in the EU &apos;s delegations in third countries .
In reply seventeen southern states have demanded the right to set up their own police forces .
We must ensure that the trade agreements which we undertake with the ACP countries are favourable to their interests and , crucially , that they are undertaken as tools for development .
Moreover , appropriate legal proceedings have been initiated in order to obtain a refund for the costs incurred following the disaster .
Often , when a self @-@ employed driver purchases a vehicle , he is bound to pay for it in somewhat burdensome instalments . In order to meet the payments , he is forced to increase his workload .
Mr President , I listened to the first answer given by the President @-@ in @-@ Office and to the one she has just given .
No @-@ one would have thought , at that time , that we could discuss the Burma situation for two and a half hours in a very open way .

Thanks to this database it is now possible to gain online access to all documents relating to each petition .
The refusal of the Commission and the Council to carry out a review and revision would de facto result in a late entry into force of the budgetary aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon .
The process of assessing the impacts of a regulation contributes significantly towards reducing the bureaucratic burden that is a by @-@ product of statutory regulation .
This kind of critical analysis is totally absent from the EU &apos;s Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2007 .
Until we are able to organise legal immigration , we will continue to have illegal immigration .
We still have no reason to hope that this will change very quickly in 2009 .
Even though the labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency has today been awkwardly scheduled between electricity and gas , we are discussing important and very tangible measures that are of direct importance to every consumer , every driver , in fact to most of us in Europe .
Let me give some concrete examples of particularly important aspects in this report .
I should like to remind Members that there are links between amendments that may be adopted or rejected and amendments that may lapse , and between the Paasilinna report and other reports in the whole telecommunications package , and therefore we must be rather careful .
On the question of the protection of minorities and , in particular , of the Hungarian minority , I would point out that it has always been represented in the Slovak Parliament in ratio to its numerical size , which is not always the case with minorities in other Central and Eastern European countries .
To do so , we might need to go back to the original Community method , which is now long forgotten , based on two pillars : fostering cooperation , in particular with the Commission , and respect for national sovereignty , in particular with the Council .
With regard to exchanges with the northern part of Cyprus , let me remind you of the ruling of the European Court of Justice on 5 July 1994 confirming that certificates coming from the north of Cyprus cannot be accepted .
One further cause for concern is the steps taken by some governments which have recently come to power and have not followed the principle of institutional loyalty which should oblige governments to adhere to agreements already signed .
I hope that we will be able to discus this issue at some other point , and I assume that we will also be able to reach a consensus then .
We should also have an independent chapter devoted to assessing the role of funding in the case of individual programmes for large industrial enterprises and , in particular , an evaluation of the possible knock @-@ on effects .
The Commission is ready to use its instruments to support the peace process as soon as the political and security situation allows it .
The proposal provides that workers from the chemicals industry and the employees of the authorities be invited to Europe for training .

B5 @-@ 0303 / 2003 by Mr Walter Veltroni , Mrs Glenys Kinnock , Mr Margrietus J. van den Berg and Mr Martin Schulz , on behalf of the PSE Group , on the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi ( Burma ) ;
To respond directly , moreover , to the concerns expressed by Mr Schulz , Mr Swoboda and Mr Rasmussen , I must point out that , while I have a particular ideological political conviction , I nevertheless believe that as President of the Commission , I cannot be a President of the right against the left nor the left against the right .
Diplomatic approaches , pressure on cabinet ministers , telephone calls , endless promises about human rights and democracy for the Kurds and even peace in Cyprus , and finally the clincher : unless customs union was voted in , Islam and the fundamentalists would come to power .
The regions that make up Europe are not allocated a single ( formal ) role in the European decision @-@ making process .
We must therefore fight this counterfeiting .
I agree with the Council that countries should be discreet about cases in respect of which they issue such a request , but countries should also have the freedom to say : &apos; That is such a minor offence , I am not going to extradite people for that &apos; .
However , to impose quotas or talk about managing migratory flows , while at the same time recruiting the brains and muscle power from the South which are useful to the &apos; European market &apos; is a hypocrisy which in actual fact is helping to conceal the networks of people smugglers , to encourage people to emigrate to a life of wretchedness and exploitation , and even to criminalise migrants to the detriment of a policy based on equal rights and freedom of movement .
Are we going to replace animal meal with genetically modified soya , imported from the United States ?
Report ( A5 @-@ 0038 / 2001 ) by Mr Zimeray , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , on the request for waiver of immunity concerning Mr José Ribeiro e Castro &#91; 2000 / 2178 ( IMM ) &#93;
The facility is a kind of quick @-@ start package .
That is most fitting , because efficacy requires availability .
I view the report as one more example of how little real analysis has been done on the actual foundation for this hazardous monetary venture .
Some say that this is a directive which , in the first instance , needs to be seen as part of the financial services sector .
The essence of Mr Guerreiro ’ s stance is illustrated by amendments such as Amendment 23 , which describes the social impact of economic solutions .
A purely fiscal interpretation will not help us to solve the present problems , which are reflected in falling economic growth and consistently high unemployment .
It is the reporting of companies : yes , they will be doing things to tell regulators what they are doing , but regulators will have to be involved .
There is nonetheless some quite sharp criticism , and I am very glad about that .
Through its association and trade agreements , the EU can conduct an active policy in favour of human rights and democracy .
I also wish to express my thanks to Mr Diamandouros , because the new facts that he brings to light in the position he holds are reference points for the trust that the citizens place in the institutions .
Finally , we express our joint will to help the parties to apply their agreements , such as the Tenet Security Plan and the Mitchell recommendations , including the mediation of an impartial mechanism , as agreed by the parties .
As sovereign wealth funds have an international scope , it is clearly important for Europe to cooperate with the other recipient countries , on the one hand , and with the sovereign wealth funds and those responsible for them , on the other .
They emphasize , as if such emphasis were necessary , the value of the formula for closer co @-@ operation now recognized in the Treaty which has recently enabled progress to be made by circumventing the obstacle of the unanimity rule .
This programme is just an entertaining expression of your desire to impose a cultural and social model on the European people that they have not chosen themselves .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , the context of agriculture has changed a great deal since 2003 , and the analyses we have today are already out of date and not really up to the crucial challenges of the future .
Parliament has also secured a significant improvement in passengers &apos; basic rights on both international and national lines : there are provisions for liability in the event of accidents , and rights for people with disabilities or reduced mobility .
We therefore recommend the House not to adopt this amendment , since it conflicts with our obligations under the WTO Agreement .
Mr President of the Commission , could such a sickness break out even today ?
Matters at issue include the level of pensions , in one country basic protection , in another the essential performance @-@ related element , here the lengthening of people &apos;s working lives , there the forced early retirement scheme , which operates at great cost to the tax @-@ payer but which has led to hardly any additional jobs for young people .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , earlier the President asked us to observe a minute ’ s silence in memory of Pope John Paul II .
Global warming is the major challenge of the 21st century , and Europe must , emphatically , continue to set an example .
It means the price of medication used to treat Aids can be reduced .
It is at least equally important that we build on European foundations .
In order to protect European citizens and their health , the Commission has an obligation to promote early diagnosis and to reduce the barriers to testing for this disease , as well as to provide early care and to communicate the benefits of early care .
- ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , when fighting unemployment , the objective at the heart of the strategy is to make it easier for employees to adapt to the labour market , and this can be achieved through lifelong learning .
We agree on the need to improve traceability , but the issue dividing us is that harmonisation of the objective does not necessarily mean harmonisation of the method .
And , unfortunately , other programmes lack the cultural angle .
Maintaining and developing media pluralism is a basic public goal of the European Union , together with the preservation of cultural diversity and freedom of access for the Union citizen to all kinds of media platforms .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it has certainly taken a long time for the Council &apos;s common position to appear .
Everyone should do their bit .
These events of this summer , which overshadow the Middle East conflict , constitute a major problem which the institutions of the European Union need to tackle over the coming months .
This would give a clear signal to those countries we want to see drawing closer to the EU .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner for her response to Mr Vallvé .
The military overthrow that led to Roberto Micheletti proclaiming himself as the new president brings to mind the darkest periods in the history of Central America that we have known , and this attack on democracy is unacceptable in our view .
What is more , we are seeing an absolutely unacceptable situation where energy prices are determining the prices of food .
There should also be sufficient resources allocated to it for it to function effectively in an enlarged Union .
Let me draw on a proposal by the House dating back some years and advise you not to concentrate on our 15 or 25 Member States , but to act in concert with all the democracies that sit on this Commission , consulting with all the functioning democracies around the world and coming to agreements on what your common concerns are .
Thereafter , this document will be uploaded to the comitology register in order to allow the European Parliament to exercise its 30 @-@ day right of scrutiny , which should take place between the end of March and the beginning of April .
This effort should aim to improve framework conditions and access to funding and to refocus innovation policy .
Madam President , I should like to thank the Member for her report on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol modifying the Fourth Fisheries Protocol between the EU and Greenland .
That programme will cover the period 2001 @-@ 2006 .
It is not only a matter that affects Cindy from Eastenders , it is also a matter that affects people like Robert Hamilton , who is currently in France , originally from Sheffield , who was convicted of murder in 1972 , escaped from Sudbury prison in 1984 and has spent the last 12 years moving around Europe constantly evading demands for extradition .
In this way , we will have the opportunity to reward a struggle and , simultaneously , contribute towards a democratic and peaceful victory .
We will have an opportunity to discuss those problems with Parliament when together we will try to find a solution for the universal service .
In addition , after consulting the Eco @-@ design Consultation Forum pursuant to Article 16 of the directive , it will lay down what products are to be included in the second working plan by 21 October 2011 .
We are currently preparing a coordinated aid programme for both food aid and public health assistance .
Under the law at present anyone obliged to do military service can in practice choose a non @-@ military form of service .
11 .
I can also tell Parliament that negotiations with Syria are scheduled to start on 14 May .
If no one else wishes to take the floor , we shall vote on this request for urgent procedure .
Laeken must determine how we are to structure the second stage of the &apos; Future of Europe &apos; debate .
I say this very simply but genuinely , even before the Presidency : we really need the European Parliament in order to gain acceptance for this asylum policy . It is a policy in line with our European values which , sometimes , in fact , can awaken fears and criticism , even though all this forms part of the humanitarian spirit and humanitarian tradition of our continent .
In fact my question was very much on the same lines as that of Mr Watson and the Commissioner has been kind enough to come round and explain individually .
The consequences of the depopulation that was enforced in order to cut UNITA off from its supply lines must be dealt with .
A positive aspect is that at that time , irrespective of the dispute about the legal basis , its importance to women workers in the single market was recognised and a first step was taken towards establishing minimum standards for the protection of pregnant workers and new mothers .
By supporting the Commission &apos;s proposal at first reading , Parliament has acknowledged the essential contribution of this legislative initiative to the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs .
Mr President , I should like to begin with the disturbing problem of the lack of consensus which has re @-@ emerged on the question of fiscal policy at the heart of the EMU debate .
I should like to use the time available to me to identify and explain the implications of today &apos;s debate , which may appear very specific but which does call to mind a number of views of the problems of European agriculture and approaches to those problems .
It is as unacceptable now against the Serb and Roma minorities as it was when carried out against the Kosovars until some months ago .
Member States are urged to ratify and implement all international conventions in this area , they should receive help to improve their legislation in this area and child sex tourism should be criminalised in all Member States .
At the very time when this was happening , it agreed to accept substantial imports from the United States in order to solve a problem with GATT .
One of the names of Lloyd &apos;s of London received a letter from Lloyd &apos;s criticising him for daring to raise this matter with the Commission , and a rather threatening letter saying that it was a clear breach of the terms of an agreement .
In the Environment Committee we also want to see certification for sustainable biogas .
Such a committee is clearly provided for in Article 4 of the proposal , and we believe that consultation and the requirement that the Commission must take its views into account are sufficient .
Having said this , it is essential also that countries of origin and transit take a much more responsible attitude , and particularly those countries with whom we have association agreements , which should fulfil all the terms of those agreements and not just the economic ones .
– The debate is closed .
8 .
However , I do not think we should underrate the value of the communication as a manual for Ministries of the Environment and Finance Ministries in Member States .
I would like once again to thank the rapporteur Ilda Figueiredo for the work she has done and to thank all MEPs for the support they have shown for this proposal .
The cold war ended ten years ago , and the OSCE should now be developed primarily into an instrument for the peaceful political resolution of conflicts .
What is all that for ?
When the removal men come , they obviously forget the trunk .
The coexistence of religions and cultures is the only future for a democratic and multiethnic Europe .
Having said this , the Commission is , of course , willing to take on board good ideas , although we are at the moment still in the early stages of the procedure .
The efforts made in order to drive up the GDP per capita in Objective 1 regions do not always result in such an increase , not really a satisfying result over a period during which , certainly over the past couple of years , there has been economic growth .
Its integration into the Schengen area scheduled for March 2011 is a major priority .
The acute reduction of the Black Sea biodiversity is worrying due to the continuous degradation of the ecosystem , illegal fishing and overexploitation of natural resources , and oil spills contribute to the worsening of the environmental condition in this region , which is deemed the most polluted in the world .
It was not uncommon for farmers – and these are not large farms – to have lost 150 animals per farm in the area around the industry .
I do not endorse military or terrorist acts carried out by individual Palestinians or organisations , but collective punishment must be opposed because it is a form of tribal vendetta rather than a reaction .
Despite this , a great deal still needs to be done .
That is what is contemplated and that is the way it should be addressed .
I am grateful for the enthusiasm and interest which many people in Parliament have shown over the years in improving this implementation .
Finally , you want the citizens to have a say in the matter .
Today we are listening to proposals to make us condemn the interinstitutional agreement , thus leaving us without a financial perspective .
Mr President , I was unaware that British Members of this House had a reputation for being verbose !
&#91; COM ( 2001 ) 121 - C5 @-@ 0167 / 2001 - 2000 / 0364 ( CNS ) &#93;
I myself do not expect this at all .
Madam President , I wish to begin by adding my congratulations to the rapporteur on a timely report .
Parliament cannot change these details .
The entire development policy and the Common Foreign and Security Policy cover this whole spectrum .
The Commission had indeed put forward a proposal for a specific flexibility reserve , with which the Council found itself unable to agree .
That is what the Council signed up to .
In this case there is no immediate goal of having a specific result , but the overall result is better stability , more security and more opportunity .
This will require a long @-@ term presence .
In the United Kingdom there are currently nine environmental directives which should already have been transposed since the Commissioner came to office , not one of which has yet been put into practice .
A totalitarian state is no different , whether you call it Nazi , Fascist , Communist or Franco &apos;s Spain .
The EU must persistently emphasise that it is unacceptable for Israel to treat Jerusalem as if it were its own private concern . It is an international interest , not least for the three big world religions .
These contracts with Member States and regional authorities can be a very useful instrument , enabling Europe to start to bring the region nearer and give it actual shape .
We in the Group of the European People &apos;s Party intend to keep to our commitment to follow the clearly defined objectives of EMU towards a better future .
This does not just mean discussing the role and function of the national parliaments , it also means making the European Parliament even stronger .
Clear , separate provisions must therefore be laid down concerning each of them , and they must be funded jointly .
The ministers will know that I do not say this just out of politeness because I have also voiced friendly criticism of some aspects of the Greek legal system .
To cap it all , a &apos; Special Purchase Scheme &apos; is proposed for cattle over 30 months old , so that they can be stored and sold off at some point , like the terminally ill who have themselves frozen , in the hope that they can be resuscitated when a cure has been discovered .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( PL ) Madam President , the guidelines for the 2009 budget procedure presented by the rapporteur , Mr Lewandowski , relate principally to the European Parliament , and have the potential to apply to other sections .
If this is taken into account , the Vienna Summit can succeed .
We do not know the current figure , but we all know that it is high and that such a situation cannot be tolerated .
Mr President , I trust you will ask Mr Luzhkov and Mr Putin for an explanation on the way that Members of this House were treated .
The greatest challenge of Agenda 2000 will be the integration of the special needs that exist in northern , southern and mountainous regions into the EU common agricultural policy .
As a result of this I have instructed the Commission departments to send you immediately , Mr President , copies of studies , reports and other relevant material .
That is all I have to say .
The fact that this House is not immune to these strong emotions can be seen in the number of amendments the rapporteur had to take in his stride .
The airlines and national authorities that safeguard personal data are placed in a situation of legal uncertainty , exposed to prosecution for breaking national laws and to the risk of serious financial damage .
So , despite the Commission &apos;s directive of 1996 which required the disposal of PCBs , we find them coming up again and again , in particular in Belgium and in Ireland recently .
As I will not be able to take the floor when we discuss the Doorn report , let me briefly say that there is one area that is excluded from its resolution .
You are 50 % more likely to have an accident at work if you work for a small to medium @-@ sized business .
We , Mr Jarzembowski , Mr Swoboda and I - as pointed out in the explanatory statement of this motion in the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism - tabled a motion in which we justified this initiative as being a means of achieving an innovative model and approach to project development .
The EU wishes to encourage the continuation of negotiations under the auspices of the UN in order to find a mutually acceptable solution in the near future to the question of that country &apos;s name .
Following exhaustive dialogue with the Council and the Commission , we have agreed on numerous points in the compromise text .
I am delighted to inform Mr Alves and everyone that in 8 or 10 days time , a large @-@ scale conference is going to be held on the outermost regions , sponsored by the Spanish Presidency .
In fact , it is not possible to make such an assertion when no one really knows the answers , and when there are others who take a different view .
It enlarged successfully to reunite the continent at the end of the Cold War , and now it is called upon to preserve previous achievements and continue integration once better times come again .
It was clear to me from the work of the Malta gay rights movement that the employment industrial relations act is not compliant with the employment framework directive , especially in relation to sexual orientation .
I would therefore like us in future to change our thinking somewhat and move away from income subsidies , which are difficult to account for , and ensure that we pay for the job that farmers do .
The current situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo is very worrying .
Moreover , there is no doubt that the rapporteur ’ s options are in line with the legislative approach adopted by the EU within the framework of financial services .
I am glad that these ideas are contained in the chair &apos;s summary of the Paris mini @-@ ministerial .
I will conclude with another observation for the Council ’ s benefit .
It would not have been so a few years ago , but today , with the spread of television and instant communication , we are living in a new world .
I am saying this to make you understand the reaction of new Members .
However , as we all know , the financial sector has an incredible ability to pass any costs on to citizens and companies .
However , the EU appears to consider it to be among the outermost regions , in other words a territory of the Union that is subject to Community law .
I wish to conclude by saying that those who are attempting to prevent Gabon from being able , like any other country , to sell part of its fishing rights at more than three times its market value are doing it no favours .
By way of deviation from our written motion – and in order to accommodate those Members who want at least some Question Time and then the written replies – I would like to ask that the debate be allowed to encroach upon half an hour of Question Time , leaving half an hour for questions to the Council , so that we – by which I mean both the larger and smaller groups – can have a rather more in @-@ depth debate .
The Council adopted the general idea of the operation on 23 January and the related joint action on 27 January .
Mr President , in just two years &apos; time we will be facing a series of important dates for the common agricultural policy : from the verification of Agenda 2000 to the review of the common organisations of the market for seed plants , sugar , milk , and at this point also olive oil .
in writing . - ( FR ) I am delighted with the adoption of this joint resolution on the situation in China .
But many consumers currently believe that the CE mark means that products are safe , not least where it concerns toys and gadgets .
Nor has anybody forgotten Greece &apos;s Prime Minister Simitis &apos; threat to block enlargement of the Union if Cyprus does not join soon .
I am sure this will please him !
A commitment to carrying out social impact assessments could satisfy us .
in writing . - ( PT ) The sustainability of fish stocks is fundamental to guaranteeing the long @-@ term existence of fishing activity and the socioeconomic viability of the fishing sector .
Approval of the Minutes
Still on the subject of boosting competitiveness , our efforts will be geared towards interlinking networks and full operational liberalisation of the energy and transport markets .
In October this will allow us to give a response to some important problems which are still unresolved , such as the annual expenditure and its breakdown between the sums required for the purchase of IPE IV in Strasbourg , the costs connected to the new status of the Members - these proposals will have to be submitted by the working party created for this purpose by the President &apos;s Office to the Committee on Budgets by the first reading of the budget itself - the costs related to the choices that will be made regarding the status of assistants and contracting , still in progress , with freelance interpreters .
The Commission also welcomes the proposed support for the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Bogota .
It has to be deduced from all this that Parliament wants to see a European tax , and quickly .
Where your argument does bite , is knowing whether the degree of aid that can be allowed for the eligible regions , be it region A or region C , would also be acceptable in the logic of shipbuilding .
However , we must consider whether the European Union budget is sufficient to allocate additional financial resources to increase and maintain the bureaucratic apparatus .
I would like to ask the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council on behalf of my group what steps can be taken during the British Presidency to ensure that it is a proper economic and monetary union .
Everyone in this House knows how much time has been spent on this directive .
As there seems to be a broad consensus on this issue , I hope that there will also be agreement when it comes to the vote tomorrow and that we can support the Commission .
If you do reopen it , Commissioner , or rather if your colleague Commissioner McCreevy reopens it , we will be next in line to examine it .
First of all , I would like to start with a point made by an inhabitant of Nigeria who was asked what the cause of the evil in this country was .
I agree with the aim , but not with the methods .
I hope that the French , who are the latest in ratifying this Treaty , can do so as soon as possible .
The strategy should also include measures to promote the well @-@ being of families .
The rapporteur , Mr Caudron , explained to you the main areas where compromise amendments were proposed by the Committee on Industry and the way in which the Council indicated that it could take them into account , following a series of informal three @-@ way meetings .
I know that there is a match , Mr Ebner , but we must press on .
The crucial international energy situation is such that the European Union needs to harmonise and integrate its energy markets with those of the neighbourhood policy countries .
I would like to reiterate my thanks for the quality of the contribution made by President Hänsch , Mr Brok and Mrs Guigou to the work of the conference , based on the positions of Parliament .
When do you intend to deal with these items in the House ?
As a result consumers will never gain the necessary trust in e @-@ commerce .
Once a round of enlargement has taken place , however , Member States should be treated equally .
Hence , on the one hand , there is a duty to provide and , on the other , a duty to assist .
The city lies at a crossroads between the Muslim north and the Christian south , a fact that has led many to believe that the incidents are solely based on religious hatred .
We are witnessing a global financial crisis that started this summer .
In conclusion , I repeat , President @-@ in @-@ Office , let us not allow our reactions to deliver to the terrorists that which their actions can never seek to achieve .
We have become so dependent on electricity now that we even switch on lights during daylight , such as now .
The Council and the Commission have asked to speak through their representatives .
In broad terms , the report welcomes the Commission communication and emphasises the overall approach taken , with the objective being to reduce and eventually phase out emission and supply of and demand for mercury at European level , as well as to manage the surpluses of mercury and to protect against exposure .
Providing Minsk is really willing to improve cooperation with the EU , this should create more favourable conditions for the kick @-@ off of mutual discussions , not only externally but also domestically .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - Mr President , we are here today to prevent a potential , large @-@ scale , human tragedy from taking place .
So the important thing about development , in my view , has always been to be able to support the economic livelihoods of people in order to enable them to be able to stay and live where they wish to live in order to be able to get the educational support , the health support and so on .
This undoubtedly strengthens the European Union in this essential dialogue with Cuba and in the objective of advancing and improving the lot of the Cuban people .
It seems totally inappropriate to us to discuss this in the framework of a topical and urgent debate .
If necessary , Mr Jarzembowski , the Commission report will also propose complementary measures to facilitate the gradual opening up of the market .
The Council also adopted the conclusions reflected in document 5165 which urged both sides to resume gas deliveries to the EU immediately and to develop solutions that prevent recurrence .
This is nonsensical , because you cannot have a directive which purports to have safety as a major part of it leaving out the issue of duty time for cockpit crews .
But we are encouraged that the concept of the separate chapter on employment is clearly established and enjoying overwhelming majority support .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Trakatellis report is a moderate one .
One word that has , of course , come up time and again in the political talks on asylum and migration issues in recent years has been solidarity .
At the same time too , bilateral military co @-@ operation between the Member States and Indonesia was discontinued .
We trust that this work will continue to benefit from the support of the European Parliament .
This is why I am particularly glad to welcome , at today &apos;s sitting , Mr Victor Orban and his colleagues from the Committee on European Affairs of the Hungarian National Assembly .
I feel that it is our duty to mention the role that one of our colleagues , Mr John Hume , has played in this process .
If Voltaire were to return here , however , he would also draw a caricature , certainly a very impressive one , of those that today think that everything is for the worst in the worst of all possible worlds .
This is a natural part of a crisis management organisation &apos; s activities , and work of this kind is being done both within NATO and the WEU , as well as within the UN .
There is no sign of a military attack on the horizon .
The question by Mr Papayannakis concerning synthetic drugs is also related to the joint action on drugs .
They do so both at and away from our committee meetings , and only the day before yesterday both ministers travelled to Brussels to discuss things with the committee .
We can only be successful in this matter if all three institutions work together .
Provision has therefore been made here for another programme , and the Commission is planning to combine these instruments into a single Neighbourhood Programme in order to simplify matters .
This ancient Dutch proverb is only partly applicable to the European Union budget for 2003 , which will be set this week .
It did not work ; poverty became worse than ever .
This is all well and good , but how is a person to penetrate the labour market nowadays and work towards getting a worthwhile , high @-@ quality job if people with disabilities are not provided with adequate teaching , education and training , for instance ?
I would like to tell you that it is far too early to be doing this .
We therefore say that the Commission must shortly , within two years , present us with a report describing how these measures have performed , how they have affected the administrative costs of businesses and to what extent they have been useful in combating tax evasion .
The utmost respect must be paid to the need for social , economic and regional cohesion and the highest priority must be given to the defence of the populations of those regions highly dependent on fisheries .
We do not want to see this extended to fattening pigs and calves .
What is the marking exactly ?
Finally , the Commission will continue to keep the relevant committees regularly informed of the progress of the negotiations .
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , which is entangled in its own bureaucracy and perhaps paralysed by its inability to quickly mobilise the necessary resources , has proved to be inadequate , but the mobilisation of NGOs and the International Red Cross has been entirely remarkable .
The Commission and the European Union give a vast quantity of money to developing countries , the majority of which to Africa .
In any case , everything must be done to give the Democratic Republic of Congo and the millions of Congolese people , who have suffered so much and who have reacted with so much energy and vigour , their chance .
This obviously marks an important stage in collaboration , and I believe that the Commissioner herself should be congratulated on this .
Increased intergovernmental cooperation is therefore a precondition for the region to achieve positive development in terms of peace , the environment and balancing out economic and social differences in the region .
With that in mind , we aim to table comprehensive proposals in early December for discussion at a conclave of foreign ministers .
They often serve to bridge the gaps in the activity of local and national administrations .
Must we wait again for disasters as happened in Germany in 2002 before we do something ?
Something must therefore be done about it , and it is more difficult to do this with the recast procedure than with a full legislative mandate .
Nor could I accept paragraph 21 of the original text which , using the fallacious argument that it would ensure equal treatment for all shareholders , calls on the Commission to accept the principle of ‘ one share one vote ’ .
But I must also thank the European Parliament , which has been very consistent on this issue - from the preparatory work of the Committee of Inquiry to the resolutions we have drawn up here ; not least among the results of this consistent approach is the fact that we have now secured codecision rights in this domain .
We should , of course , make intelligent use of such sanctions and target them in such a way as to ensure that the lives of ordinary Belarusians are not affected , but we should not hesitate to impose them , including the suspension of Belarus &apos; membership in the Eastern Partnership .
In order to be effective , however , we need so much more than a strong police force .
Well , far from finding peace again , the Timorese are now suffering a real tragedy .
That is why I turn to you , my colleagues , and ask you to endorse this report .
So I say no to extra taxes , but yes to a different form of taxation with a fixed budget which favours employment , local economic activities , the environment and health .
Following the reading by the Committee on Petitions , the Council has promised to introduce a new practice .
Legal restrictions are needed .
The Pact has also provided us with an appropriate framework to confront the challenges of fiscal policy in the medium term .
Thank you , Mrs Reding .
Irregularities were also found in staff selection procedures .
I quite definitely belong to the second group .
The crisis implies that Europe can provide as powerful and as swift a response as any other world force , such as the United States , was able to provide faced with the tragedy represented by the financial crisis .
How to deal with our neighbours ?
Nevertheless , trade is European , so the laws have to be European , and this is the path we need to continue along .
The serious economic crisis being experienced in our countries , with particularly worrying consequences for SMEs , spurs us on where encouragement was needed .
The European Union therefore opted in 2002 to adopt a guideline quantitative target for spending on research and development , otherwise known as R &amp; D. This is the well @-@ known Barcelona target of 3 % .
But when it came to a Europe @-@ wide definition of environmental impact assessment , we all backed out . We called for subsidiarity .
What is more , the President of the Italian Council has a say in who is appointed in the public sector of the media .
These rights are embodied in the EC Treaty and in the Posting of Workers Directive , but are being ignored by the Member States . Such behaviour undermines our Community .
First of all I would say in reply to Mr Sjöstedt &apos;s question that the European Council in Madrid fixed the starting date for the third stage at 1 January 1999 .
However , I am now concerned that many amendments that were comprehensively defeated in the Industry Committee are being retabled .
This is true in general for all regions where fishing is a traditional resource which , as such , ought to be safeguarded , not only by limiting the industrial catch by fleets from other countries , but also by ensuring the continued existence of breeding habitats .
Therefore , this assessment also covers the acute and long @-@ term risks to honey bees and their larvae and the tests applied are based on standards developed by intergovernmental organisations such as , for example , the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation , in which 47 governments collaborate .
Now we have to decide where the headquarters of Galileo &apos;s supervisory authority should be located .
The document emphasises the need for the two new states created by the partition of Sudan mutually to recognise the other &apos;s sovereignty and urges the adoption of measures designed to help consolidate and stabilise their presence on the path of democracy , respect for human rights and mutual recognition .
Secondly , to enlighten Mr Ducarme , the General Affairs Council planned for 18 June will basically aim to secure approval , within the Council framework , for the common strategy for the Mediterranean which will then in principle be submitted to the Feira European Council .
There is no single universal model of flexicurity and so this concept should be put into effect taking account of the specific circumstances and traditions that prevail in the different Member States .
I do not accept the Commission &apos;s excuse that the directive in question needs to be extensively revised in the context of Agenda 2000 .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , what we are discussing now is an encouraging beginning to a long day , rich in budgetary debates .
The fact that the US is supporting its strategic NATO ally ( so that Turkey would clear the way for Rasmussen to become Secretary General of NATO ) should not result in the negotiations on full membership being accelerated .
It is however also true to say that the Environment Committee did not come up with any clear or precise data on ways of protecting the public from long @-@ term exposure .
The final major problem in relation to Parliament &apos;s budget concerns property policy .
I hope this much @-@ needed document will herald a new era in contacts between the EU and the Pacific Islands .
One of the biggest challenges that may come from the essential efforts to match the tasks of the Commission with the resources of the Commission will confront this House .
If a candidate country displayed such fundamentalist beliefs on the place of women in society , and such discriminatory beliefs on homosexuality , it would be rejected .
The same provisions are in place in all Member States of the Union , but the way they are implemented varies considerably .
This report deals with the development of renewable sources of energy in far too detailed a manner .
This should not be the priority for this House .
We also need to remember , as the Members who have already spoken have said , that desertification contributes to climate change , as it causes the degradation of the soil and the loss of vegetation , which is associated with an increase in emissions , therefore it would be very helpful to support reforestation policies in order to re @-@ establish and change conditions in arid areas .
One of the principal roles of the presidency will , of course , be to guide very carefully the final phases of economic and monetary union .
What is the Commission doing to actively prevent abortions from being funded under international population and health programmes and related measures encompassing the area of &apos; reproductive health &apos; ?
These peaceful neighbourly relations have formed the basis for the international cooperation which has developed in the Baltic region , particularly as a result of the Helsinki conventions and the HELCOM cooperation on the Baltic &apos;s marine environment .
But , for instance , elements of the Pakistani ISA have long been suspected of granting tacit support to the Afghan Taliban and are only now reluctantly realising the domestic dangers of such an approach .
This is a topic for fundamental discussion which enjoys a wide popular appeal .
We need a political response on a global scale to this unprecedented challenge in order to weed out the real roots of terrorism which stem from political , social and environmental conflicts : this concept underlies the report of Mr Watson , which this Parliament adopted last week .
Within the course of its regular and continuous contacts with the European Parliament , the presidency of the Council has , since the Council &apos;s meeting in Cardiff in 1998 , informed the European Parliament of the state of the process of integrating concern for the environment into other relevant areas of Community policy .
We all know that , as well as showing solidarity with Pakistan &apos;s flood @-@ hit populations , another fundamental reason for granting aid lies in the decision to support Pakistan &apos;s counterterrorism efforts .
As Mr Liese rightly pointed out , the House has been addressed by small farmers from Guatemala and by representatives of the institutions in that country . It was stated clearly that some of this regression involved the murder of small farmers or threats against them .
The EU has a vital responsibility .
The economic crisis has made poverty considerably worse .
Is it not time to review this financial statute ?
The final problem is equality .
I shall therefore vote against this report .
The vote will take place today - since it is after midnight - at 11 a.m.
We do not have the stomach or the appetite for it , or indeed the wherewithal for such action .
I would now like to share with you our reaction to Mrs Hoff &apos;s report , presented by Mrs Mann , which is primarily concerned with nuclear safety in Ukraine .
The first GSP regulation of the 21st Century must re @-@ affirm the European Union ’ s leading role in promoting sustainable development and trade in the world .
A thorough , forward @-@ looking dialogue will be held on the basis of the Convention , in the form of four workshops to be held over the next two years .
&lt; empty &gt;
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen of the Commission , I am assuming that you will be receiving a vote of confidence from this Chamber tomorrow .
It sounds a lot of money and Ministers quail at the figure .
At the same time , I very much tried to retain the right of passengers to information .
Faced by a united front of the Budgets and Budgetary Control Committees , the Commission has been very helpful in assisting Parliament to regain control over the agencies .
I would like to mention Mrs Flemming in particular , who has put forward some very interesting proposals . They will undoubtedly play a key role in the committee responsible , as well as in Parliament , during the next round .
No option on our agenda should be neglected in order to reduce our energy import dependency .
Your appointment has been swift , and that is a good thing .
This is one of the key reasons why they have a separate meeting of eurozone ministers .
As a result , there are no Community legal texts which will regulate this issue .
We need one or two major debates in plenary session each month in this building and , apart from that , everything should be discussed in committees .
Let me also say a few words on this institutional reform .
Lastly , I fully support the rapporteur &apos;s proposal which calls on the Commission to forward to the European Parliament a copy of the report carried out for the Commission by external consultants on the impact of all Community measures adopted to date in the fisheries sector for the outermost regions .
I heard some Members refer to that ruling as if it were a victory .
I will shortly ask Commissioner Verheugen to outline in detail the Commission ’ s findings in the Comprehensive Monitoring Report , but let me first make some general remarks .
We are not quite sure where it is supposed to be leading .
I believe that the end result can be qualified as a success , not only for this reason , but above all because we have succeeded in making progress in extremely sensitive areas , such as encouraging the use of the flexibilities provided for under the TRIPS Agreement so that we can promote access to essential medicines at affordable prices within the framework of national public health programmes .
However , they also affect powerful companies with strong interests as well as the use of tax revenue .
A lack of tax coordination .
Unfortunately , it is too late for many of the victims , but just think of the future victims whose lives have been saved because of the decision taken today .
In this case , as in so many others , the best authority is the one which does not have to take action but may initiate the action process .
Environmental protection measures taken in the EU will have little effect unless they are also taken worldwide .
If we are putting premiums for dairy cows online , why not also put the premiums being milked by senior officials online too ?
During the debate in plenary on Tuesday evening , I stated my support for the &apos; Chichester &apos; package on the security of energy supply , despite its calls for the liberalisation of the energy sector that I could not have supported had they been proposed in isolation but which , as it happens , are part of a whole multifaceted and bold &apos; package &apos; , which takes the European discussion on this matter forwards .
With disaster looming whether it goes ahead or not , the public authorities are clearly skating on thin ice .
It never ceases to amaze me how the same MEPs who , in a Stalinist way , call for bans on public speaking or even prison sentences or the loss of parliamentary immunity for right @-@ wing dissidents , get cold feet when it comes to common @-@ or @-@ garden data processing - in the context of the fight against terrorism , mark you .
In the future , women will be increasingly involved in the serious , hotly debated issues of the day .
Mr President , first I wish to congratulate Mrs Redondo on her work and efforts and on the passion with which she has supported the obvious .
That is known as environmental dumping .
Only the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe changed sides , which is to their credit , while the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats refused , as usual , to demand accountability .
According to article 1 , anyone fighting for fundamental political and social change can easily be labelled a terrorist .
The fact that there are no amendments tabled is a clear indication that we can all agree on this text .
Our greatest frustration is the fact that BSE and foot and mouth no longer seem to feature in the Commission &apos; s dictionary .
Regarding humanitarian aid work , Mrs Bonino made a point of stressing how its implementation was being baulked at present by security problems and administrative difficulties .
I hope that in two years &apos; time , when this directive enters into force , it will no longer be possible in the European Union to have a repetition of such legally incomprehensible court decisions as the one recently handed down by a Lithuanian regional court against a Latvian aviation company and its main airport .
What I expect of the President of this House – not you yourself , but rather the President in his capacity as such – is that the results of these investigations should be publicly made known before today is out .
I asked him to explain his statement that the Americans are well on the way to becoming members of OPEC .
Children are more computer literate than ever but , with this increased literacy and confidence , the dangers posed by unscrupulous persons are not clearly apparent to them or to their less literate parents .
We are facing the disastrous , but logical , consequences of the agreements that we signed in Maastricht and thereafter .
I welcome the excellent preparation work by the Commission and the real possibility of saving over one billion euros per year to the EU budget .
The draft report presented by Mr Manfred Weber to the European Parliament in plenary contains nothing more than ( more or less ) cosmetic changes that do not go to the heart of the matter .
What can I say about Mr Voggenhuber , who is from the country that so marvellously organised Euro 2008 , which we Spaniards are so pleased about ?
We have set up the SIA to ensure that there will be continuous and rapid feedback into the negotiation process .
To avoid any greater confrontation Bush should reverse his decision and embark on an active dialogue with the EU and other parties to the agreement on climate to ensure that we can together take adequate action to prevent climate change .
In his recommendation Mr Belleré comments on the implications of summer @-@ time arrangements in the present and future Member States of the Union , in many cases reinforcing points that have already been made by the Commission and by Members of this House .
If Europe wants to take itself seriously , it must fight for this criminal court and must say to the United States of America that they are indeed our most important ally , but that just such an ally has a duty within the free world to take the law seriously , however uncomfortable it may find it .
Laborious negotiations have once again shown that ambitious goals regarding one of the Union &apos; s external policies evaporate in practice because of the firm positions held by the national Member States .
Mr Prodi , you spoke of glasnost in order to describe your future policy .
In future , compliance with the Maastricht criteria will be enforced by imposing much tougher penalties .
More to the point , in her report , Mrs Thomsen supports the target of at least 40 % women and 40 % men on the various committees under the Framework Programme .
If you imagine that last year alone saw a 16 % increase in dealing in such material via the Internet - and add to this the fact that over 20 000 children are abused for this purpose , to produce these pictures , in a single year - you have an idea of the dimensions .
Others , as mentioned by the rapporteur , refer to the proper use of the concept of subsidiarity .
I would see this as particularly important in these two areas .
The second major objective is to ensure the success of enlargement .
Theoretically there are external borders and then internal borders , but the external borders differ from State to State and , therefore , if decisions cannot be adopted in the Council in this area enabling immigration to be regulated in a uniform manner throughout the European Union , it will be impossible to create a great Union market .
It points to ways and means to be adopted more widely in programmes governed by the Structural Funds .
In these dark and overcast times , the Kirilov report may be a breath of fresh air .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
The report notes that speculation has been responsible for 50 % of the recent price hikes and thus endorses a revision of the existing legislation on financial instruments in the interests of transparency , making them serve the economy and agricultural production , and preventing speculation from jeopardising efficient agricultural holdings .
The European citizen will feel truly privileged that we have such a grand praesidium to service our work .
I think yes , but if you compare it to where we were two , three or four years ago , it is much better .
Certainly not 1.03 % . That is the centre of the iceberg .
Have we really nothing better to concern ourselves with than yesterday &apos;s news ?
We have an SME helpline to make cooperation easier .
I support the report &apos;s intention to facilitate the mobility of professionals and to guarantee the safety of consumers .
In Granada , Extremadura and other Objective 1 zones , thousands of families depend on tobacco @-@ growing for their livelihood .
We are opposed to the policy of a fortress Europe , surrounded by barbed wire , whether electronic or simply legal .
It is necessary to analyse all 27 pension systems in the EU .
The Committee on Petitions undertook a special fact finding mission to Malta last year to report on the situation .
In my view , the arrangements made at Luxembourg , namely ECU 10 000 from the European Investment Bank and ECU 450 million from the Community budget over three years , are inadequate .
Membership is possible only when the membership criteria have been met .
I believe that we must be very careful when referring to the detention of asylum seekers because it is not simply a question of deciding to put a stop to detention once and for all and to have it apply to everyone .
He then studied at European and American universities , and has always been associated with Strasbourg - he studied here , has received honours here and it was also here , as far as I know , that he met his future wife .
Well , I believe that the main difficulty in this matter is precisely that of knowing whether Mr Geremek has been a party to the Stalinist intrigues , to this most appalling form of totalitarianism , and , if so , to what extent .
I believe the Commission as a whole needs to commit itself to developing both quantitative objectives and indicators whereby we obtain reporting worthy of the name .
I thank the Commissioner for a very thorough answer and ask him three questions .
Furthermore , it is extremely important to bring about an improvement in the relations of Croatia with its neighbours and , in particular , with Slovenia , and to find a definitive solution to the question of the borders with other neighbouring countries .
I myself was informed of it in detail by the Swedish Government in Stockholm last Sunday . Let me repeat that in addition to the Commission proposal there is another one that will be decided upon .
How should this be done ?
I call for European funds from the agricultural sector to be used to develop technology to adapt this sector for the fight against climate change .
The only question is whether we will deal with them while the tension can still be dealt with , or when neo @-@ fascist groups filled with hatred run riot in Europe &apos;s cities .
Those who now revert to the old attitude that everyone should look after themselves first are misjudging the dimension of global competition and offering their citizens a false security .
I hope that we can at least agree on the principle , namely that operational expenditure belongs in category 3 and administrative expenditure in category 5 .
I would simply like to say , in conclusion , that if Turkey continually defies and distances itself from European ideals , that is also happening because Europe , by constantly putting only economic interests and criteria first , has not made Turkey understand properly that human rights must have priority .
I should , moreover , like to remind you , Madam President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , that you also have a task to carry out in Doha , namely organising the meeting with all of the trade ministers .
And I take good note of what was said by a liberal President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council with regard to the Barcelona Summit : social cohesion , the defence of the European social model , the capacity for adaptation and dialogue with social partners ; I believe that that defines the route we must take .
If you look at Paris Charles De Gaulle , Schiphol , Frankfurt and London Heathrow all together , the conclusion might be , for instance , that there was no justification for a third runway at Heathrow .
Member of the Commission . - I very much share the concerns expressed in this question about the welfare and well @-@ being of Europeans , the questions on employment and social protection and fighting poverty .
I dare say that the information you have is therefore selective , and you do need to have a very thorough stakeholders meeting because those are , let me say , very enriched figures .
The problem , therefore , is to examine the issue jointly and to place greater weight , if you like , on prevention .
What is the cause of this ?
I know the bit at the beginning perhaps cost me some seconds .
I am well aware of how difficult this is .
One of the most important features of Natura 2000 is that it reflects that integrated approach ; it puts people at the heart of the process and , in particular , people who live and work in our rural areas .
At first reading , the European Parliament and the Commission agreed on four amendments to the original proposal .
This agreement , as one may easily imagine , represents hope for this little Himalayan country .
( PT ) The number of workers affected by unemployment in Portugal is growing exponentially .
And in answer to Mr Pompidou , I would like to say that from the European standpoint , national differences in the way the policies are implemented will emerge as of lesser importance .
However , we need effective soil protection with a shared timeframe and common criteria .
Since 2004 , the Commission has , furthermore , regularly published guidance documents for the Member States that have helped them to adapt their national systems .
I also welcome the boost given to the independence of competences and duties of the potential operators of the transmission networks .
Mr Barroso made no mistake when , during the debate in plenary , he observed that there was no consensus on a proposal for a framework directive .
We have constantly to ensure that the European Union provides more and more value for its Member States and citizens .
The proceedings of the past few weeks and months have not always been honourable .
- Before the vote :
Three , my Group is wholly in support of an increase and improvement in the Ombudsman &apos;s investigative powers .
We have undermined the confidence of European and other consumers .
With regard to Romania and Bulgaria , our resolution was reported to state initially that we appreciate it that those countries have set themselves a target date , namely 2004 .
The opening of the institute has marked an important step for us in the area of gender equality .
.
This internationalisation of organised crime is in stark contrast to the inability of the EU Member States to adopt a coordinated approach in dealing with the trafficking in human beings .
Eleven out of the 15 Member States are more or less sure to go ahead , however , and we accept that the consequences will have to be dealt with as best as possible .
I think that yesterday &apos;s release of Mr Abassi Madani might possible calm the situation currently prevailing in Algeria which concerns all of us .
I promise you – and this is something I say frequently – that in future I will say : it is , in part , a crisis of the European Heads of State or Government minus Mr Juncker and Mr Verhofstadt .
We find undertakings that resort to illegal workers , especially from non @-@ EU countries , or factories such as ThyssenKrupp , with their old @-@ style industrial arrogance ; those who should be defending the interests of the workers often consent to , if not connive in such situations , instead of being vigilant and quick to point out failings in the safety system to those in charge ; finally , the works inspectorate and other bodies in charge of control and monitoring often fail to show much initiative .
The scoreboard is one of a number of instruments that we have to improve the internal market and I think the perspective on which the scoreboard is based is of particular interest , since it concerns citizens &apos; expectations and problems and because it improves the internal market specifically for consumers .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , the Schengen Agreement , as we know , must not promote mass immigration into the social systems and the freedom of travel must not lead to an increase in crime and illegal immigration .
When it was discovered that the terms of the pact were being infringed by small Member States of the European Union , such as Portugal , they were obliged to proceed to apply harsh measures and spending cuts in order to reduce their deficit to below 3 % , and none of the big Member States now in violation asked for the pact not to be applied .
And all the vast array of treaties and administrative and legal cooperation conventions that have been signed is not worth much if these instruments frequently remain the dead letters denounced by Mrs Theato .
Closure of sitting
A solid legal framework is therefore essential .
It is essential that there should be adequate funds for enforcement of the Law of the Sea , and this is one of the few fisheries @-@ related areas where the EU provides some added value .
We can conclude this matter as quickly as possible .
As far as 1996 is concerned , and I quoted the figures , we achieved these objectives .
Since we do not have any particular unilateralist tendencies , we must , therefore , change the legislation on a number of points or , at the very least , clarify its position on these issues .
This Aznar plan is 200 times worse than the plan for an industrial estate between Aachen and Heerlen .
Technical problems were deemed subordinate to political will at the time , and this is still true for the majority of MEPs .
Then let him act upon his words , as Gedeon Levi , a Ha &apos;aretz reporter says .
– Mr President , the announcement of presidential elections next July does not constitute , for the time being at least , the to the establishment of political stability and the democratisation of the country .
Take a look at your own country , where members of the Convention have now come out in opposition to the Constitution .
To that end the Commission took a more strategic approach during the programming of the Lomé IV second financial protocol .
Compromise Amendment No 20 clarifies the legal situation establishing that the Community regulation procedure will apply to registered homeopathic medicines and that it should be accepted .
It must be accomplished at all costs , because , quite simply , the idea of operating in fifteen different countries which , at this stage , are in any case metamorphosing into one single country , with different rules governing basic business principles , is not viable : we will not be able to sell it because it does not make sense .
I say again , this has not been an easy task .
When Commissioner Gradin raised this issue and made it one of the priorities for her term of office , there was probably quite a lot of amusement and scepticism about the extent of the problem .
The constraints facing consumers and the automobile industry must be taken into account , but they must not prevent us from achieving the objective of safety .
The Pomerol is sadly lacking in information .
Mr President , in terms of human rights , there is of course a great deal amiss in Chechnya .
In order to allow society to benefit from these innovations , it is important that investments be made .
In addition , since Eurofor includes a large contingent of French forces , it is essential to distinguish between the Épervier plan and the European forces .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission , by publishing the second report on economic and social cohesion , has paved the way for an important debate on the future of the European Union &apos; s structural operations policy .
This is important .
Thirdly , OLAF will be subject to monitoring by independent , external experts .
While this may still seem a Utopian dream , except for white collar and office workers , the social partners must pay close attention to this and there should be specific clauses in each contract of employment and in each regulation .
We know that , in the chancelleries , there is no plan and even less political will to move forward .
I would like to point out that it is also essential to protect the financial interests of the Community , and therefore I recommend amending Article 12 of the draft as follows : ‘ If a financial aid beneficiary cannot satisfactorily document the use of the aid and , after being urged to do so , cannot demonstrate that the aid has been used in accordance with the Regulation , then there must be clawback provisions in place .
There are highly significant macroeconomic imbalances in some countries , including Hungary and Latvia , which are currently having major difficulties with their balances of payments and require substantial financial support from us , from the monetary fund .
I therefore remain puzzled and still believe that we cannot trust the activities of United States intelligence agencies .
The measure is a move in the right direction ; it must be completed soon with the submission of a relevant proposal .
I also reject the notion , implicit within this that agents booking any travel arrangements should bear the contractual responsibilities and liabilities of either party
That is what we are doing after Lisbon .
The main changes to the Commission proposal concern the scope of the regulation , the functions of the agency , the general provisions , the Governing Board and the appointment of the ETF Director .
The rapporteur &apos;s recommendations on the necessary diversification of our aid programmes , on their decentralisation , on improved capillary action and on the extension of micro @-@ loans seem relevant because they are well suited to the social and geographic structures of India .
Once more , thanks for the support received from the rapporteur , Mr Caspary .
How are you going to resolve this question ?
I rarely agree with David Martin but I do on this .
I therefore draw the conclusion that this Commission accepts social dumping .
There have been a lot of problems when constructing power lines as a result of the way in which decisions have been made at local and regional level .
I want to address two questions , if I may , to the presidency : would it consider convening a regional summit on security in South Asia ?
It has brought justice to many victims .
We might also say that the two documents , the Commission proposal and the Council action plan , contain a great deal of common ground .
I was a little concerned , when returning from the Council of Economics and Finance Ministers in Luxembourg yesterday , about the complete lack of movement there .
German companies are also investing a lot in the new Member States .
That is why , in agreement with Mrs Wallström , I submitted guidelines to the Commission which were approved on 14 March .
Granting immunity to members of a legislative body , an instrument which has been disputed on countless occasions , is intended to give them the freedom to express their opinions .
Regrettably , I repeat , I am not of the rapporteur &apos;s opinion .
However , in view of the need to deal with the consequences , including linguistic ones , of future enlargements , this limited increase in the budget of our institution more than ever requires rational and responsible management of this budget .
Here , too , however , we later decided - following the negotiations - that , in systematic terms , it would be better to regulate this within the framework of a recommendation than in this specific text .
What is more , the Union is not responsible for all health policy matters , and this is a problem I shall come back to later .
The main area in which work is needed is actually that of domestic householders .
Mr President , many people still suffer from incurable degenerative diseases that affect the whole body , such as multiple sclerosis , Parkinson &apos; s , Alzheimer &apos; s , diabetes and leukaemia .
At the moment , all of the information with which scientists are providing us seems to indicate that this vertical transmissibility , in other words infection of offspring by parents , does not take place .
Order of business : see Minutes
Firstly , there must be a harmonisation of the resale right .
When we can go there and actually achieve something , we shall be sure to go .
The opposition leaders were harassed and , following the election , people were killed in riots .
However , it will call for an alternative method of harmonising taxes .
However , I have two specific questions .
The vast majority have highlighted the validity of the CITES in terms of helping to conserve species that are in danger of extinction .
That is our first achievement .
To that extent , ISD @-@ 2 is a missed opportunity .
In fact , Europe has also made progress in this field .
At the same time , Turkey is being given considerable autonomy by decision makers in the West , with clashes between Ankara and Israel and tighter relations between Turkey , Iran and Brazil .
Mr President , as representative of the Pensioners &apos; Party in the Group of the European People &apos; s Party and European Democrats , I also voted for the Pirker report , particularly because of Amendment No 13 - which has been adopted - tabled by the rapporteur , which provides for permanent erasure from the central database of the names and electronic fingerprints of those who , having arrived in our States without refugee status as yet , are then recognised as persons who should be permitted to enter the country and are accorded refugee status .
Leaving aside any limitations that may be found , I believe we should welcome the report on which we are voting in this House .
Following this , the Commission launched a joint procedure between the framework directive and the EU Water Initiative , a procedure which Greece headed for the part of the initiative concerning the Mediterranean .
Tomorrow , our task will be not to seek a humble , secular political majority on specific objectives , but rather to build a moral majority in this House .
Now we have to decide as quickly as possible how to solve the problem that we have no budget .
The Anglo @-@ Dutch example which the Commissioner quoted is related , inter alia , to the additional taxes which are being levied in each Member State .
We must , therefore , make sure not only that we get proper coherence between the agencies working on the ground but also Madam President @-@ of @-@ the Council , that we do not take decisions which mean that we are spending money futilely because of a Council decision that we must have some people removed some 100 miles away in another place .
Our efforts are based on a common set of values . They are freedom , democracy , a respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and a commitment to the principles of the rule of law .
That is why I support Mrs Schleicher &apos;s report and would also thank the Commission for its initiative .
He returned to his family home in Italy and was forbidden to teach in his family &apos;s native country because his training was undertaken in England .
It is for this very reason that the Tomlinson Report is so important today , because it should provide the appropriate financial and other backing required to ensure that the European Commission really can use the money it is spending and its political and moral commitment to best effect .
At the review conference , which is being held in Geneva from 11 to 21 December 2001 , the EU will present a common position on the issue of the unexploded remnants of war , requesting concrete steps to address this issue under the CCW framework .
in writing . - I voted for this resolution , which sets out Parliament &apos;s position in advance of the Cancún climate change conference .
For instance , the general political agreement reached with the European Parliament on the creation of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology - a very concrete project and a real flagship for innovation in Europe - and also the launch of an integrated maritime policy for the Union .
The work of journalists , both Albanian and foreign , has been made impossible .
Nevertheless , we do take the view that animals are a part of the traditional circus and that it must be possible to adopt directives that enable circuses to keep them .
According to estimates , this could lead to savings of about EUR 30 billion , and the greatest benefit would go to small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
At present , the members of the Exchange Rate Mechanism II are Lithuania , Estonia , Slovenia and Denmark .
However , it would be a mistake to think that we do not need to question the current level of the Cohesion Fund .
We can be encouraged by the fact that the social partners reached an agreement in the rail industry and in maritime transport .
Biotechnology must also be stimulated .
Again and again , of course , we are confronted by the problems of industry which , in championing the cause of human health and our right to treatment , urges us to come out in favour of the directive which would make it possible to patent living and non @-@ living beings , including man , by enticing us with arguments about increased employment and raising the spectre of an invasion , in the field of biotechnology , by American and Japanese multinationals .
Written declarations ( Rule 116 ) : see Minutes
The text contains references to the effect the project will have on cultural heritage , such as on the Sagrada Família .
Could you therefore confirm that this discrepancy still exists and above all whether it is not in fact necessary to bring the 1977 directive into line with the new legislation on fuel quality ?
I am very pleased that the Schengen testing ground for policy , as I have called it , has induced the realization that these measures are essential .
We have made a balanced proposal on the controversial issue of donations in line with the 2001 compromise and consequently propose that donations should be permitted , although only if they satisfy strict conditions of transparency .
The European Parliament routinely deplores the inefficiency of the CFSP , without wanting to recognize that this stagnation is structural .
Those representing Europe who are active at the grass roots level in pursuing this objective , and I am thinking in particular of the Special Representative of the Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations , are on the verge of despondency precisely because , since matters are improving , there is less talk of Kosovo and the urgent nature of the aid which is needed there is becoming less apparent .
However , the French representatives Jacques Chirac and Lionel Jospin called for a stay of execution so that they can get through the presidential elections without any trouble .
There is no academic evidence for this .
Mr President , on many occasions I , like many other of my fellow members , have lamented the lack of coordination between different Community policies and between the various Directorates @-@ General of the Commission . I could even say the same for the Parliamentary Committees in this House .
Some EU Member States do not belong to the NATO military alliance .
The first is that we must continue to prioritise support for the regions lagging the furthest behind in development terms , for future Member States but also for current EU Member States .
All these things are clearly important in themselves but ultimately it comes down to creating conditions in which women can choose freely .
However , I am not convinced that an approach based on gender or on separate groups represents the ideal solution to this .
As far as Turkey is concerned , enlargement and the consolidation of relations between the European Union and this country are , I believe , positive both for the country and its democratisation and for peace and stability in the area .
The Union needs economic leadership .
Through their amendments , the Socialists clearly want to give people from third countries more rights than EU citizens .
I welcome this initiative because the SMEs are the backbone of the European economy and a key element in achieving the Lisbon objectives .
In the middle of the last European elections , I watched a documentary about the plight of the Hmong people .
I believe that representatives of the new Member States will find their place , too , in the new structure of the European diplomatic services .
In a couple of weeks , on 10 May , the Burmese people will be asked to approve or reject a constitution .
The European Union can no longer be content just to express good intentions faced with such a situation .
No strategy for eliminating violence against women can be successful if the victims do not report the fact of violence to the right authorities .
Finally , I will reply to Mr Blokland on the classification system .
The Commission has agreed with Serbia to begin dialogue on the liberalisation of visas after the entry into force of these agreements .
Together we embarked on an unprecedented path of engagement with the Iranian leaders and , ladies and gentlemen ,
It could have expressed a lot more in the way of hopes for the future .
Neither , as Mrs Sommer has already said , do we want to notify specific critical infrastructures and collect them somewhere , rather we want to ensure that secrecy is guaranteed .
Furthermore , agriculture needs support in order to innovate and focus effort on a more efficient use of energy , water and soil .
However , the question of duty of secrecy for in @-@ house lawyers essentially arises in the context of inspections attempting to establish the existence of serious restrictions which fail to comply with the provisions of Article 81 ( 3 ) .
The Minister knows what I am referring to .
On this occasion , the rising price of agricultural raw materials was highlighted , particularly its impact on consumers in the developing countries - my fellow Members have spoken about this at length - but also on the populations of poor countries , which import cereals .
I believe Europe has serious responsibilities at the present time with regard to the Middle East .
Right across Europe , we need better interaction between judges and public prosecutors .
This means that the transatlantic summit is very important , for it will – it is to be hoped – help us to make progress .
Where consumer rights are concerned , we believe that consumers should be entitled to bring claims in their place of domicile in the event of disputes relating to electronic commerce .
Here I have in mind young people who have grown up in children &apos;s homes and who suffer from a severe lack of vocational guidance .
I hope that Commissioner Vitorino does not feel weighed down with too many questions about the Schengen Agreement and the Nordic exemption from having to carry a passport , but I should like to follow up what has been said by my fellow MEPs , Mr Sjöstedt and Mr Krarup .
I will conclude by appealing for two concrete changes which are very important to Parliament and also , I hope , to the Commission : greater efforts to avoid any delays in payment from now on ; and assessments of growing and production methods , with the aim of withholding funding from those projects having a negative effect not only on the environment but also on the health of banana workers in producing countries . The use of biodegradable substances in the banana @-@ growing process should become a priority here .
On this point , the response is as follows : the services negotiations and the IMF structural adjustment programmes are not related .
We have discussed all the variants which have been mentioned here .
The reality here is that we are still in a phase where the basic , real , political issues must be addressed first .
In addition , I cannot consider that there are any individual European countries ‘ on trial ’ , and I say that in inverted commas , particularly to our friends in Poland and Romania .
( DE ) Mr President , Mrs Hedegaard , ladies and gentlemen , we are not here today to hold a discussion on the climate .
Through the cooperation aid provided by the European Commission , priority has been given to improving access to basic education in the context of Pakistan &apos;s politics and education .
I believe the Commission has developed a good system which , as I said , is much easier to handle and in the end will also be cheaper .
Mr President , I also voted against the Brok report despite my own , and my party &apos;s , long @-@ standing commitment to a wider Europe .
Read the agenda .
Legal maternity protection , two years &apos; maternity leave , child benefit , a legal ban on hitting children : these are things I would like to see for all children in Europe .
We also experience ongoing sectarian attacks , such as the recent murder of a 15 @-@ year old Catholic boy , Michael McIlveen .
She has a very difficult and challenging job .
The text we have adopted will be revised in four years &apos; time .
I support this new approach , since the aim of the legal adjustment is not to define product safety , but to create a transparent environment in which reliable information will be provided on the properties of products .
deputising for the rapporteur . - Madam President , I have the honour to present to Parliament the report of the Committee on International Trade on macro @-@ financial assistance ( MFA ) to Bosnia and Herzegovina .
I would like to know whether those options are within the rules or whether we are looking at a change in the rules .
As the need for information on the euro has now been largely acknowledged , it would be wise for this to be implemented effectively and quickly as our rapporteur rightly stresses .
It is that Parliamentary resolution , therefore , that is still valid today .
These feeder funds exist in the United States , which is an area with a single supervisory authority and a single legal system .
I believe that the European Commission &apos;s acknowledgement in the 2010 @-@ 2015 Action Plan of the need to combat gender @-@ based violence by all means is a significant step which must be translated into specific actions .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank Mr Borg for the information he has provided us with on the progress of the negotiation of the Convention on Cultural Diversity .
First of all , the world &apos; s governments must adopt a concrete action plan and again undertake to fulfil the Beijing objectives .

That is why I welcome the negotiations on the question of unexploded ammunition left over from warfare .

Recognise the democratic aspirations of your people , cease the political repression and enable opposition forces to engage fully and freely in a fresh constitutional process .
We are now in an important financial year and , for the first time - we will thank the Commission for this - it offers us this opportunity to see the programming of Headings 3 and 4 , in relation to our activities .
This report , let me remind you , is based on the Commission &apos; s annual economic report for 1999 , the first of these to be published under the euro system , which , consequently , is more concerned with the single European economy than with a series of national economies .
The European Parliament has always taken a clear and unequivocal position on Morocco and the Western Sahara .
That is why the rapporteur has not expressed an opinion .
But at the moment I cannot do so , for legal and institutional reasons , and I beg you , please be as understanding as you can of the Commission &apos;s position .
I am referring in particular to fish and wine .
We want to wish them a happy festive season and ask them to be just as helpful next year too .

The Eastern Partnership was an objective of the Czech Presidency and I am delighted that it has been approved with a firm commitment of EUR 600 million .
In their letter , the women of Darfur describe the horrifying scenes of violence and rape which are part of daily life in the province , where rape is intentionally used as a weapon , in order to cause women suffering and to stigmatise them , as well as to destroy unity and demoralise the whole of society .
The European Union treaties have not bestowed on the Community or the Union the competence whereby the Union could regulate on abortions .
The sum of EUR 330 billion until 2020 means a contribution from EUR 16.5 billion up to as much as EUR 40 billion from a country like Poland .

They must be covered by strict codes of conduct , with an annual report to the European Parliament .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Commissioner , as required by tradition and by the budget procedure , it is my responsibility to present to this House the draft budget for financial 1998 , as drawn up by the Council on 24 July last .
Vive la différence is still the watchword for the organising of elections to the European Parliament .

We believe that the scope of this decision goes beyond the single issue of environmental protection .
The peoples of France and the Netherlands condemned on the basis of their experience of life the European and government policy which brings austerity , unemployment , inflation and uncertainty through capitalist restructurings as promoted in the financial perspectives for 2007 @-@ 2013 .

The fostering of prosperity in so @-@ called developing countries is a necessary measure , particularly in order to prevent a tidal wave of migrants flooding into Europe .
( LT ) Madam President , Minister , a month ago in this venue the same question was put to a European Commission representative , but we did not get a clear answer .
( Applause )
Instead , it should agree in principle to set up a new convention – pluralistic , parliamentary and transparent – with a broader brief than that of Laeken , especially to modernise and refresh Part III , to bring the common policies into line with the aspirations and anxieties of our citizens .
It calls for the right of residence in Europe of those subject to the travel ban to be rescinded , for members of their families to be barred from employment and educational institutions in the European Union , for high @-@ profile economic links with Zimbabwe that have given the regime international prestige to be curtailed , for those providing financial backing to the ZANU @-@ PF regime to be identified , and for measures to be imposed against them .
The Union should also inform citizens when their views have been taken into account and explain what the implications of those views have been .

The only new thing now is that it is not spreading gradually by land but rapidly via air travel from Hong Kong and Singapore .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs Stauner &apos; s report , which we are discussing today , is important in more than one respect .
The report is remarkable in places for its euphemistic use of language , which , again , I can only regret .
I believe that , with sophisms of this type , it is we who endanger our freedom , our democracy and our principles and of course our security , because a society which allows lies and distortions in order to dominate the oil market and indulge in strategic whims of an imperialist nature weakens itself in the medium term and thereby jeopardises its cohesion and security .
When , in the past , the Swedish Government was heading the campaign for Sweden to join the EU , it said the goal was not only to retain the Swedish welfare state but also , together with other left @-@ wing forces , to pursue a social welfare policy throughout Europe .
Inevitably , the draft resolution is less specific .
There are various reasons why costs are not being covered in the sector and why it is currently not profitable to go out fishing .
However , when we examine the content , in other words the tools that will enable us to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases , I have the feeling that it will not be possible to achieve the targets in 2020 due , for example , to the climb @-@ down on vehicle emissions and derogations for energy producers in particular .
Mr President , we are particularly anxious that the situation in Chechnya seems to have worsened dramatically since the oral question was submitted to the Council .
Commissioner , I recall very clearly that at the start of its term in office , the Commission made various promises about all the things it wanted to do better , especially its plans to reform and improve the Commission &apos;s functions and working methods .
in writing . - ( PT ) I voted against this resolution .
Mr President , this morning , listening to Mr Patten , I was struck by the fact that he stated that , at the end of his five years in office as a Commissioner , he considered the international situation to be more dangerous than it was five years ago .
Traditionally , this policy has been focused on mitigation inside and outside the Union .
We must also recognize the leadership of Chancellor Kohl .
As Alfred de Vigny said , &apos; What does the bottle matter , provided the contents are intoxicating ? &apos;
Although it is not as important , we must not forget in this document that with some form of recognition - here known as certification - mobility in this professional sphere can be increased .
It remains for me to thank Commissioner Rehn for his tremendous cooperation .
The European Institutions can make splendid EU legislation , but in the end it is up to the willingness to invest of new entrants on the market whether the liberalization will actually work .
In this connection , I would like to compliment the European Ombudsman for having carried out a study on his own initiative precisely on the Commission &apos;s new way of dealing with complaints and infringements , particularly the way the Commission records , or perhaps simply does not record , complaints against Member States for disregarding Community law .
If Mr Santer had sat with us hour after hour in the Committee on Budgetary Control just trying to get the key information out of the Commission , he would understand our urgent desire to see real action and to see a change in the present procedures . There is quite simply a need for a more independent office .
I believe that the European Union &apos;s primary duty is , in fact , to combat this very real danger .
However , it is clear that , if Cuba were to be considered for membership , it would have to abide by well @-@ established provisions of the Lomé Convention which include respect for human rights and the rule of law and democracy .

In this era of globalisation , an effective system for regulating trade is more relevant than ever .
And it is time for everyone who signed the Dayton peace agreement to start putting it into action .

The immediate consequence of the terrorist attacks was a further loss of consumer confidence and a widespread sense of uncertainty .
The other Member States will also be able to identify any common difficulties .
I assure you that this is perfectly in order under the Rules of Procedure .

Canada has no right to try and undermine the democratic will of European citizens by taking our clearly non @-@ discriminatory seal ban law to the World Trade Organisation .
But the answer they received from the International Olympic Committee , the IOC , was terrible . It had the presumption to say that Atlanta Plus &apos; proposal was a politically motivated attack on a religion .
The great merit of the Commission &apos;s communication and of the report we are considering today lies in the fact that they once again highlight , in an almost paradigmatic manner , the contradictions inherent in European integration . These contradictions set European policies at odds with one another and the report highlights the paradoxical effects of these very same policies .
There are no more scientific controversies on this subject .
We voted in favour of two of the amendments taken in plenary : Nos 4 and 5 .
This major innovation is being prepared right now on the same basis as you were talking about .

First of all , I think that this is probably the most important institutional question that we will face within the next four to five years .
It is important that any future changes in policy should take as their starting point an analysis of how the disease has been handled up to now .
We have to remember that , unlike the USA , we in Europe have opted for wide @-@ ranging product legislation .
Otherwise , in a few generations ’ time , there may be no forests .
We can see that the frequency of these disasters is increasing , even if they are not all such serious ones .
They agreed that the Commission would explore , under its financial cooperation programme , specific activities involving , inter alia , ethnic minorities to reduce poverty in the Central Highlands and thus to deal with some of the root causes of problems in the area .

However , the June List is immovable in respect of the issue of tax policy .

The Commission &apos;s established policy is not to restrict the financing of companies in charge of public service obligations .

The social partners are called on to implement the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value .
However , in all sincerity , Mr President , and following on from what Mr Aelvoet said , I am not content with this agenda .
Many challenges at international level , in particular , with regard to the Middle East , Libya , Iran , terrorism , energy security , climate change and the financial crises , cannot be overcome effectively without responsible and cooperative relations with Russia .
The Committee on the Rules of Procedure is asked to draw up that code , so that it enters into force at the same time as this new text .

I welcome the Commission &apos;s appeal to send an observer mission to this election but I have two questions for the Commissioner : one is , we have heard various reports of voting lists being destroyed around the country and how can an election take place in this environment ?
In my view we do not need to go that far - historical compromise is a concept that is vague at the very least , if such a compromise is needed at all .
I think these are very important views and the Commission should listen to them and take heed of them .
( Applause )
This applies not in the least to the Council .
For the time being , we have to carry on the debate , which is difficult because cohesion policy is being called into question and sometimes condemned .
Turning the motion for a European Parliament resolution almost into a propaganda exercise , pretending that it is the ideal outcome of noble , harmonious work done in the best possible manner , even saying that the Intergovernmental Conference left the Convention ’ s text unaltered – although we know that that is not true because all the amendments made by the Intergovernmental Conference made the text worse : one need only think of the Legislative Council or the disagreement over the budget – none of that will convince a single Eurosceptic or help us win over all those who , far from fearing a non @-@ existent European superstate , know that the Union is not yet united enough or cohesive enough .
The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is poor and deteriorating .
I too share many of the concerns that have been expressed .

author . - ( NL ) Capital punishment is barbaric and freedom of expression is set in stone in Afghanistan &apos;s constitution .
For example , a call to ban all government officials and representatives of the justice system from entering the EU will not achieve the intended objective .
As we all know , in today ’ s environment there is an intertwining of different sectors , be they manufacturing , services or trade .
Do you remember ? John Major was pleased because he got everything he had wanted .
The difference between those who merely talk about democracy and those who live it – and you live it in this House – is being able to say what I have just said and to defend people on the grounds that they do not benefit from a certain number of legal rules , even though those people will pose a threat to us in the future .
The Turkish inhabitants of Cyprus should be given every opportunity to cooperate and to have their say , but this must be within the context of a joint solution for both the Greek and Turkish populations , and it must also be clear that Parliament wholeheartedly supports Cyprus &apos;s efforts to become a member of the European Union .
Indeed , the only rumours that I have picked up about such unwarranted concessions actually came from the Irish Foreign Minister in the General Affairs Council today .
I strongly believe that the setting @-@ up of the External Action Service can be a success if Council , Parliament and the Commission work closely together .

There is the risk of creating a monopoly within the car dismantling trade .
Unfortunately , the Commission &apos;s proposal does nothing of the kind .
That strategy is aimed at sustaining the peace accords and breaking the cycle of poverty and exclusion that affects the country .
Trade is not in itself a threat to the environment - on the contrary .
However , the issue is what proportion the originating securitiser should hold in that particular matter .

I believe that it is not just Europe that is learning from them , but all the countries of the world .
The next item is the statement by the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council on the Spanish Presidency programme .
The Commissioner for Trade , Peter Mandelson , repeated that obtaining positive results in the Doha Development Round was , and would continue to be a priority for the EU .
There is smoking going on everywhere , something which sometimes causes acute difficulty in breathing for those who are allergic to smoke , among fellow Members of Parliament too .
Here too the manufacturer &apos;s role will be important and with it the manufacturer responsibility .
The last year has shown us that , with the same treaty and with the same outdated principle of unanimity , it was possible to make progress with Europe but that it was also possible to reach a deadlock .
I think it must be clear to everyone that this will be lower by then .
I have here the electronic record confirming its transmission .
Finally , if we are to deal properly with all these issues , we must have a proper legal base for energy policy in the European Union , and a first step towards harmonizing Community requirements on this issue is to ensure that the Euratom Treaty is fully integrated into the Treaty on European Union .
Mr President , the foreign and security policy issues , to which we have referred repeatedly , confirm that our political analyses were correct : the current figures in the draft budget are insufficient to address the challenges in Afghanistan , Palestine or Kosovo , and cutting the Emergency Aid Reserve is merely a virtual solution , the point of which we cannot grasp .
Report ( A5 @-@ 0338 / 2000 ) by Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the situation of frontier workers &#91; 2000 / 2010 ( INI ) &#93;
I should like to mention certain points : firstly , the question of the definition of the public service mandate should not be confused with the question of the financing mechanism selected in order to provide such services .

Did it help to improve health service provision in underdeveloped countries , or did it not ?

There was one exception to this .
That would be a fitting climax for the Year of Education through Sport .
( HU ) Madam President , the Ombudsman &apos;s activity report clearly shows that the lack of transparency in European Union institutions is one of the biggest problems .
The European Commission is imposing increasingly more frequent and higher fines on the cartels and companies which abuse their position on the market .
In other words , we intended to accept everything that seemed reasonable and limit our amendments to things which were absolutely essential , and even then in a spirit of great moderation .

Only in this way will we be able to diversify food production and supply , guaranteeing an improvement in quality and greater environmental safety .

. – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would firstly like to thank you for your support for our initiative on the interoperability of electronic road toll systems , which is an essential element in the European policy on charging for infrastructures and on the management of transport demand .
In this respect , the Commission &apos; s initiative is commendable .
Hence the need for monitoring through ongoing negotiations between the Commission and the Chinese authorities , in order to guarantee the principles of freedom and democracy : respect for these must be a prerequisite in the development of China ’ s trade relations with other economic areas .
This paragraph does not belong at the beginning but at the end of the resolution .
The reform of income aid will , however , link direct grants to the role played by the farmer as a manager responsible for his land and for the rural environment .
It is not easy and the situation is far from ideal , but it is also fair to say that it is showing willingness and determination to ensure the compatibility of an effective public security policy with respect for human rights .
Promises - in Britain we were promised a referendum on the European Constitution , Lisbon Treaty , call it what you will .
Finally , the statistics on the proportion of women and young girls affected have demonstrated the failure of the current prevention policies , and in my opinion that is why it is essential to adopt an ultimately realistic approach , by increasing the funding of research into new vaccines and microbicides .
Thirdly , this approach gives an opportunity to lead on to honest competition between Korean and European companies .
Mr Posselt , the Rules of Procedure , which I have followed to the letter , are very clear on this and do not allow the electronic voting system to be used .
I welcome what the Commissioner said last week about impact assessments being required before a new proposal is put forward .
Good luck , President Sarkozy .
However , to receive my support , Morocco must first respect human rights and stop oppressing the people of Western Sahara .
The Council has not had opportunity to discuss this matter .
Sometimes people criticise trade unions and say that they are a cost to society but they forget the huge benefits which they provide , as they are the ones behind the introduction of such important policies in the workplace such as those within the framework agreement .
Mr President , when I read the Never @-@ Ending Story to my grandchild , Niklas , I think of the Court of Auditors &apos; annual report .
We are fortunate .
Mr President , Mr Carnero , ladies and gentlemen , I , too , am glad that the history of this legal contradiction will , it is to be hoped , come to its end for the time being when we adopt Mr Carnero &apos;s report tomorrow .

Mr President , I have to say to Mr Papayannakis that I really cannot answer the question he has put or , indeed , his supplementary question .
Market organization in beef and veal

President Barroso &apos;s speech this evening was good .
Our Heads of State must pay for their costs like the rest of us .
The report makes this point very clear and I hope that its resolution will be read not only by those for whom this document is officially intended and who have a professional interest in these matters . I hope that it is also read by the people who are - legitimately - concerned at the direction in which the process of international economic and financial integration is heading .
I believe we are only now facing into the real test .
The future participation of China in Galileo through substantial financial investment in the programme is most welcome .

We are , however , able to support fire prevention activity .
The question I would like to give some thought to concerns the improvement of the economic situation as a result of the interim agreement .

Furthermore , Mr President , I am pleased to note that a number of speakers referred to the priorities that we have established .
There is therefore a great deal of work still to do .
In Greece they have been doing the same stupid things for four years .
This document will have the residence permit format common to all Member States .
We take a favourable view of incorporation of the Protocol on Social Policy in the new treaty and extension of the co @-@ decision procedures to social matters , depending on cooperation , but we also hope that it will be possible for the social dialogue in a broader sense to reappear in the co @-@ decision procedures for which the Treaty provides .
It is often forgotten , that the European Union is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution .
I find myself in the unusual position for a Conservative Member of speaking on behalf of the Cooperative Union of the United Kingdom , but also on behalf of the Retail Consortium , the Association of Convenience Stores , the Association of British Chambers of Commerce , the Automatic Vending Association and , strangely , the Scottish Grocers &apos; Federation .
I would also like to express my support for the motion for a resolution .
This is excellent .
On the other hand , since the show of force by the world superpower , against the law and will of the international community , it seems as if the European Union is rebuilding its unity on the basis of resigned or enthusiastic subordination to the fittest .
Coal is not used in the steel industry to produce energy but as part of the production process .
Indeed , the main goal of our policy is to reduce the socioeconomic and territorial disparities in the poorest EU regions .
These are also based on the WHO guidelines , but it is accepted that these will be exceeded on a number of days each year .
That is why I encourage the European Parliament to look very favourably on these proposals , which certainly have the support of the EU Media Commissioner .
On the other hand , biofuels imported from third countries should also be certified according to strict environmental criteria , in order to ensure a positive environmental balance .
In this way , the Council has displayed its concern as to whether or not these conditions will be met .
That is what the operation of an effective competition policy is all about .
This is why we voted in favour of the Resetarits amendments .
in writing . - ( PT ) Of the many aspects of this draft budget for 2008 that could be highlighted , we would like to stress two :
Such a centralisation of power in Brussels is not the solution and would not be acceptable .
Do you genuinely think that imposing financial penalties on Campania will resolve the crisis ?
It proposes a strict division of tasks between the Commission , the supervisory authority and the European Space Agency , with the Commission being assigned the role of owner and the European Space Agency the role of manager .
There are many Member States that have not even started to look at implementation .
Indeed , Parliament has always come out in favour of greater transparency in the work of the various committees , emphasising in particular the need for the agenda and minutes of committee meetings , attendance registers , drafts submitted to committees in relation to implementing measures , provisional timetables and results of votes to be passed on to Parliament .
Unfortunately , this is not happening .
That is the nub of the problem , and we cannot hope to make any progress with the sporting world until it is resolved .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I wish first of all to thank Mme Mosiek @-@ Urbahn for the excellent and difficult job she has done on this complex matter .
ECU 20 million have been spent this year on projects located in Kenya , Malawi and above all in the Caribbean .
( DE ) Mr President , for technical reasons , we Social Democrats were unable to sign the joint resolution within the time allowed but signed it later .
Here is a minority that is being persecuted for its Christian faith .
We have tabled those amendments to improve matters .
Indeed , we agree with this .
But to a certain extent , the Council and Parliament must also accept some responsibility for this crisis .
Another factor is the exclusion of initial training : Amendments Nos 12 , 110 , 111 and 112 .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I appeal to you to discuss this matter a little more calmly and to try to differentiate between what we agree on , namely to ban human cloning , and what we perhaps do not yet agree on , namely our position on other cloning in nature .
The reason is very simple : relevance .
( Applause from the left ) I had not appreciated that the word &apos; benchmarking &apos; is untranslatable .
Two resolutions have already been adopted as part of the shared responsibilities and joint action under the third pillar , and we are optimistic that a racism monitoring centre will be set up in the near future .
The Commission is therefore proposing the creation of 500 non @-@ permanent positions within itself .
Commissioner , how do you intend to ensure a balance amongst the concessions in these three sectors while also respecting the timetable set ?
Mr President , I will not repeat what has been said already but will limit myself to one general point which I feel has not been adequately covered so far , and that is the accession costs .
Once again , I would like to thank you for the debate and for the critical remarks , and I would like to thank all of you who showed understanding and appreciation , both on a political level and on a personal level .
We take note of your remarks , Mr Bushill @-@ Matthews .
For example , we want to see statistics broken down according to gender so that we can discover and combat differences between men and women where health and disease are concerned .
At the same time , we must learn from the crisis .
But now it is going to end , according to the joint motion for a resolution , for the EU &apos;s federalists demand that this regional cooperation , this international co @-@ operation , be subordinated to the European Union .
We believe there is something to be said for a study , if only to work out a concrete action plan . Proof can then be established that there will only be a shift in jobs , and that the possible social and transport problems in peripheral regions will be countered in all earnestness .
We will establish a minimum capital requirement of EUR 125 000 .
Turning to Iran , it is to be hoped that it is not yet too late for what we would prefer to see , that being a diplomatic solution , which would of course have to be agreed with Russia and China .
The difference between the two was the use of language .
The conflict that we are talking about has many causes .
We have to have fair conditions of competition .
If our Member States cannot cope with our funds , how will the new Members be able to do so ?
The current economic crisis , preceded by the financial crisis , was greatly amplified by the decreased liquidity of SMEs as a result of the position of the banks in the economic crisis .
Some may argue that sufficient scientific evidence has not been produced to justify this .
We thus have a stable platform for future work and cooperation .
This is why I fully endorse this report .
A few manufacturers use cadmium , which is a toxic substance , in their solar modules .
As Mr Rapkay said , competition policy is an instrument , not an end in itself – I totally agree .
Finally , I agree with those of you who feel that the budget should be higher , but at this moment the best thing is to focus on the delivery .
I believe our aid can only be a drop in the ocean , but it may serve a useful purpose inside the country , helping to overcome the barriers that exist there .
Mr President , this morning we witnessed another show , another performance , on the television news . We saw buses full of soldiers - or made out to be full of soldiers - which were said to be leaving Kosovo and returning to Belgrade , like a sort of Barnum &apos;s Circus caravan .
I have high hopes for the Lisbon process .
I therefore think that the solution given in the Gklavakis report could enable cotton @-@ growing to continue in the two main producing countries .
The EU was disappointed by the interruption of the negotiations with Maoist leaders started by new Prime Minister Deuba in November 2001 .
It is very true that in the Council the right @-@ wing governments have adopted the same position , regardless of whether their geographical location is in the east or west .
We also say that all states should naturally refrain from nuclear weapons testing pending international agreement on a total test ban .
In February , the Greek authorities had refused to grant MAT a permit for charter flights to Corfu , citing as grounds the airline &apos;s name , MAT ( Macedonian Airlines ) .
If it has been broken by members of the Security Council , then , clearly , the Security Council will also lose its credibility .
The European state is here .
Further details on research to be carried out and specific financial allocations are contained in the specific decisions establishing the programmes .
It is all about the industry understanding what its future will be and then private investment will come into the industry .
It may be that the decision , be it favourable or unfavourable , will be taken by a very small number of votes , and then , in any case , at least 50 % of MEPs – to be fairly precise about it – will be less than happy .
We can help in this and it is thus very important that financial compensation should be given only when efficient supervisory mechanisms are in place and the nets really are destroyed .
On the basis of these initial results , the Commission intends to present a proposal at a later date , on a framework decision on the general conditions for Community support within the context of Article 169 and the possible areas where this could be used .
You can make a point order if you wish , but please tell me the Rule .
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to take a few seconds over my allotted time merely to direct at those in the back seats , on the right over there , a traditional Castilian saying : &apos; A palabras necias , oídos sordos - silly words will be met with a deaf ear &apos; .
I could , perhaps , summarise it by saying ‘ the whole Århus Convention , and nothing but the Århus Convention ’ .
I think that neither side should stipulate conditions for ratifying these protocols which are in the interest of both the Turkish and Armenian peoples .
Tibet , as we know , was occupied by China , but for some reason we have recognised it as an inseparable part of China .
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday , 28 February 2002 .
I mentioned earlier the example of the Balearic Islands , currently the richest region in Spain and an island region .
Although these four subjects are quite distinct , the same sort of comments can be made about them all , and these are of three types .
In addition , the market is being constantly monitored , the time given for the reports on the undertakings has been shortened , and when the monitoring showed that the minimum price for salmon fillets was too low , it was increased to include an amount for processing costs .
This should be regarded as being a frivolous attempt to wreck this report and it would serve no purpose to refer it back .
In the vote I will be supporting the amendments proposed by the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy ( ITRE ) , which aim to expand the role of the existing Body of European Regulators in Telecom ( BERT ) as well as give the European Commission additional powers .
In two other Member States - Mrs Regner spoke of Austria and Luxembourg - the legislation is currently being examined by their parliaments .
This will be in the sense of an adaptation of existing regulations , of an adaptation of the rules rendered necessary by the present situation , and not in the sense of overregulation .
However , if we look at what is going on in the European Union and internationally , it is quite clear that it is precisely this concrete action that is lacking .
The work of the Audiovisual Observatory is important for these SMEs .
The European Union is one of the world &apos;s leading economies , the engine of which is made up of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
To date , we are uncertain as to whether the entire island will be joining the EU .
Please bear in mind that a large proportion of farms in the eastern part of the EU are family farms .
Mr President , I would be extremely grateful if anyone who is supporting the amendments to criminalise glorification could be so kind as to try and answer the points that I raised , which are , first of all , that I fear a chilling effect on free speech and , secondly , that I do not know how they can be made operational .
I should like to begin by thanking the Commissioner for an excellent exposition of the rapid reaction facility .
The remembrance of the events of August 1980 enriches this word with meaning and emotion .
Who , moreover , among those present in this Chamber would be pleased if his or her daughter were to become a prostitute ?
All these Green Papers are all very fine and dandy .
The European Council in Florence last month indicated its conviction that the trans @-@ European networks , the development of small and medium @-@ sized industries and scientific and technical research can make a vital contribution to job creation and competitiveness .
An all @-@ European crisis map is necessary to measure and identify the micro @-@ regions by their distinctive attributes .
Expansion of production capacity in third world countries must be supported , for example by means of the European Development Fund .
Chapter 17 of that Act sets out the circumstances in which Polish MEPs may lose their seats : their eligibility , that is the eligibility requirements on the day of the poll , may be invalidated , giving rise to the possibility of forfeiture if these requirements were not met , and various other matters , which I shall not cite in order to get to the crux of the matter that I should like to discuss here .
Let me now address a few of the Members , and I am looking in particular at the PPE Group , because Mrs Grossetête , who like myself is a member of the Committee on the Environment , said at first reading that people do not want this in the first place and that I would be upsetting all manner of things with this amendment .
Although there is no &apos; one size fits all &apos; solution , the Commission , in its recent communication , &apos; Fighting Rural Poverty &apos; , has identified some key principles to be applied in all rural development interventions .
Under the treaties , the aim of a common foreign and security policy for the Union is to safeguard its independence and integrity , as well as strengthen its security in all its forms .
In practice , this mainly concerns the stream of heat energy released from primary energy sources .
This is a political question and it concerns the involvement of the European Union in this process .
On the one hand , enlargement must not lead to a new division of Europe .
We believe this is an important directive and we must all work to ensure it is implemented , because our ultimate objective is the impact it will have on the life of working citizens .
What needs to be done in external policy in order to enhance our security in the face of the terrorist threat is to promote not only peace but also economic development .
Ladies and gentlemen , I opened my speech by explaining why , in my opinion , the College I preside over is leaving behind a strong legacy and a renewed and vigorous institution .
We strongly support your efforts to put pressure on certain governments , which keep their markets closed while they take advantage of open markets elsewhere .
This programme represents the only opportunity for most citizens of participating in the body of European thought , and becoming involved , as active members of our civil society .
Although we note with satisfaction President Klaus &apos; statement that the &apos; events full of violence and human tragedies &apos; , which had also befallen the Bohemian Germans , were &apos; unacceptable acts from today &apos;s point of view &apos; , nothing comparable has been said by the Czech Government , or by its parliament , or by groups or parties in it .
Mr President , I very much agree with Mr Cornelissen &apos;s remarks about tourism .
This contains labelling proposals for products derived from animals that have been fed GMOs .
This is possible by means of infrastructure development , for example , by building nurseries and developing various educational and cultural options .
What we now need is to be determined and consistent .
That should not , however , be a reason to reject the proposal , but rather a reason for improving it .
I would remind the House that two Chechen children died of exhaustion as they attempted to cross into Poland with their mother .
These include the adoption of a public procurement law , which should play an important role in the fight against corruption and in increasing competitiveness .
I also appreciated the comments by the rapporteur , Mr Ken Collins , on the collaboration between the Commission and the European Parliament .
The British Foreign Secretary , in his presidential capacity , also visited the region from 15 to 18 March .
I think it contains all the desired information .
Fourthly , we must improve the relationship between the European Union and the United States . We must be more effective .
I wish to congratulate the rapporteur once again and to support adoption of the regulation .
My party and group are committed to giving our full support , in particular to the British Government , its partners in the European Union and to our NATO allies .
We do not think these are the sort of signals we should be sending out .
They must also act consistently and in good faith .
What action do you intend to take in this area , in order to change this situation ?
I concur with his view that decisions on granting refugee status should be taken more quickly , more fairly , and more predictably , which in itself is the ultimate objective of introducing a common European asylum system .
As to whether the Council is yet prepared to take our opinion into account , that may be more of a pious wish than a hope .
The framework directive will contain a general clause prohibiting unfair commercial practices detrimental to consumers .
So I agree with Mr Macartney .
Mr President , in order not to interrupt the flow of the vote once you start , I would like to inform the House that the Socialist Group is withdrawing the third part of Amendment 62 , that is the part concerning points b and c of Article 2 ( 1 ) .
Our good name is at stake here .
Sentences as tough as these have not been handed down in Cuba for several decades .
Minister , the European Union &apos;s first great initiative in terms of foreign and security policy must be nuclear .
But this discontent is in fact swelling against genuine , authentic , violent racism , which no @-@ one here wants to recognize .
The average loan is EUR 7000 .
Concerning the Liberal amendment , which would serve to eliminate the effective subsidy that these agreements provided to fishermen , the Greens supported it as we feel that distant water fleets should not be so heavily subsidised , especially when there are so many problems with the terms of the agreements under which they operate .
Can we resolve the problems with competition law ?
Some time ago , concern arose in port circles when it became known that the Commission was planning to submit a new proposal for a directive on the liberalisation of port services even before the inauguration of the new Commission .
The Security Council should play a part , but there is a difference of opinion about the interpretation of the UN resolutions on Iraq .
I believe the UK presidency will be judged , in the long term , by what has been achieved .
The main thing to stress is that misuse of funds in one place should not prevent innovation continuing in other areas .
I think that it is a good thing in itself that we should discuss this subject again in this new Parliament .
I hope that this evening , as we did this morning , we will commit to a type of agriculture in which arable farming and nature reinforce each other .
We will have the opportunity to discuss this problem in connection with the ry report , but I would already like to say , on the basis of the news we have recently heard , that we welcome the Netherlands to the ‘ club of the 6 ’ ( as the seventh country , from 2007 ) .
I also warmly welcome the creation of rapid border intervention teams , which will offer rapid technical and operational assistance to those Member States that may require it .
He was quite right to point out that this proposal is a reallocation of an existing budget and is not about raising the total budget .
I have already mentioned Kosovo , but we should not forget the Mediterranean , Cyprus and Turkey , the Middle East and Western Sahara .
The next meeting is due to be held on 19 April and Mr Figeľ is committed to continuing the dialogue with the committee and to addressing the substance of the ongoing negotiations with the committee .
Is that what is called free and unfettered exercise of the duty of an MEP ?
As a matter of fact , these two reports and four opinions received only three votes against , with the opinions of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy preventing unanimity .
A policy of achieving economic , social and territorial cohesion by 2013 , as required by Article 3 of the draft constitution , therefore seems within reach .
We see what is going on in Russia , and when the aspirations of Georgia for European Union membership falter , we may face a situation that is quite dangerous for all European Union countries .
This is how they make ends meet every month .
On the subject of airports , the rules need to be fairly flexible for , clearly , an airport such as Malpensa , near where I live , where 70 planes take off or land an hour , is quite different from some other airports which only have four or five planes landing or taking off a day .
Apart from the fact that the general philosophy of the report – namely , positive discrimination – is contrary to the constitutional traditions of certain Member States and , in particular , to the republican universalism on which French law is based , rejection of this document is based solely upon respect for the distribution of competences between the EU and the Member States .
At the moment , this issue has reached a particularly serious stage with 15 people having been sentenced to death and a considerable number of people having been given prison sentences of more than 20 years .
I want to thank the Commissioner for the reply , even though I am not happy with the response given .
The majority at the expense of the minority .
Member of the Commission . - We are aware that the Commission is not a price setter .
The current common fisheries policy already includes large elements of regional variation and localised cooperation which could be explored more effectively in respect of stock conservation .
I also believe , Mr President , that we must reiterate our firm and decisive support for the democratic system , for the Rule of Law and for constitutional order and also express our condolences – as the Commission has done – to the people and the Government of the Republic of Bolivia , for the loss of human lives .
We pretend to put this human drama down to the weather .
The EU &apos;s intervention and financial assistance were therefore necessary , with the aim of increasing the level of protection of human health and the environment .
Is that the true cost , or is there a more up @-@ to @-@ date figure ?
These arrangements are supposed to be temporary but it seems that they often become more long @-@ lasting .
The fundamental question is whether these stacks of data serve any purpose at all in the fight against terrorism .
Regulations on conflicts of law or of jurisdiction were adjusted , the Council directive on insolvency procedures and on the service of legal documents in civil and commercial cases was adopted , and draft directives on the gathering of evidence and on rights of access in matrimonial cases were submitted to the Council .
Member of the Commission . - ( FR ) Thank you very much for your question , which gives me an opportunity to highlight the situation in the Maldives .
This is the position that we need to strengthen and help to consolidate .
Today , one @-@ fifth of rosé production involves blending .
It is not the right of Ireland or any other Member State or indeed the Commission to decide upon the tax policy of Member States .
According to Amnesty International , a Muslim woman was caned last year in Malaysia where Sharia law is applied .
For some crops , the increase was particularly large .
I should like to underline the words of the President @-@ in @-@ Office when he emphasised that the Vienna European Council spoke only of a possible extension of the duty @-@ free regime and said that this would be for a limited period of time .
The most important political issue going forward is how to decide the direction of these changes and , in this regard , I admit that much of what is contained in this report is the result not only of hard work but also of detailed reflection on values that largely sum up my view of politics as a public service .
It is too small for that , even in the area of Structural Funds , for even the most generous beneficiaries receive a very small percentage of GNP .
Our discussions with officials , experts and victims , as well as our visits to affected sites , helped us to engage in depth with the crisis caused by the outbreak of foot and mouth disease and , in general , with diseases and the means whereby they are dealt with and controlled , as well as with their prevention and with vaccination policy in Europe .
My idea was that this report should be Parliament ’ s contribution to EU @-@ China relations based on pragmatism , facts and respect for each other ’ s sensitivities , and aiming for the progressive deepening of the relationship between the two sides , which is rapidly maturing into a comprehensive strategic partnership .
The European Investment Bank &apos;s activities must be better targeted , selective and geared towards concrete results .
The Commission and Parliament can help us understand , in the first place , exactly what we are dealing with , because even the term &apos; tourism &apos; , as was , moreover , pointed out in the Viceconte report , is still an ambiguous term , a kind of variable that depends on latitude , climate , a range of opportunities , and a series of background factors ; it can be synonymous with holidays or it can be a true area of production , income , wealth and employment .
We are lagging far behind in this area and I think the time has come to change that – or at least to make an attempt to do so .
In my opinion , if today , in Greece , the retirement age is increased from between 5 to 17 years for women , that is due both to the capitalist system and to the 2020 strategy , which is not being contested .
The Lisbon Strategy did not work because it had neither means nor instruments .
We could also consider including the press , particularly the written press which should be supported and encouraged .
I would recall the words spoken by Ortega y Gasset , in a speech that he made in Berlin , with reference to Miguel de Cervantes , who said , when he was old and tired of life , that there are times in a man &apos;s life when he has to choose between the inn and the road .
As a result , while nominal producer prices have fallen , often quite sharply , consumer prices have risen .
That sum , then , if used correctly and with the flexibility we have tried to incorporate in our proposals , can be a factor which develops the programme very substantially .
It helps if you are running a business or a public service to know what the rules are , but I am appalled that this should hinge on defining the distinction between services of economic general interest and services of non @-@ economic general interest .
We see the values we share most clearly when we go outside the European Union &apos;s borders , when we travel on other continents .
This report was approved by the Committee on Regional Policy because it emphasizes the need for a Community policy which gives the European Union itself the leading role in regional planning development , which , as I have already mentioned , will encourage social and economic cohesion and competitiveness within the Union itself ; this is , of course , subject to the principle of subsidiarity , with the object of dealing more efficiently with the particular practical needs of the regions and thus including all interested sectors .
That concludes Question Time .
I welcome the inclusion in the directive of a future European regional code &apos; 3883 &apos; .
The Green Paper pursued three objectives . One was a broad discussion of the importance of exploring whether a on mental health strategy should be developed at EU level and identifying what the priorities of such a strategy should be .
As regards Amendment 24 , I should like to propose to our fellow Members from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that a word be changed via an oral amendment .
Normally , an unemployed person will be entitled to social security benefits in the country where he or she was last insured .
In this European year of mobility , take steps to remove the obstacles to the mobility of European workers .
Signing the protocol on customs union was meant to be a quasi @-@ recognition of Cyprus , which would have enabled Ankara to save face while also meeting one of the essential conditions for the opening of negotiations .
I want to confine myself to speaking about some of the reservations that were raised then which I hope to put to the Commission .
Many in the West , including myself , think the same .
It is not true that , as some of the ladies who spoke to these amendments believe , when we drew up the proposal we paid no regard whatsoever to the treaties we have concluded with the new Member States .
The EU @-@ Africa Summit last weekend was in fact a failure and you do not need to look far to find the reason why .
That violence must stop now , and I should like , personally and on behalf of my country , to thank Mr Barroso for the clear signal he has sent out today in Parliament and for the solidarity he has shown with my country and with all those countries that have been attacked .
I would appeal to the House not to seek to destabilise this carefully @-@ balanced and hard @-@ won compromise that was achieved after many meetings , with input from different MEPs from different political groups and of different nationalities .
It is , in fact , certain that very many goods coming out of the Chinese market are produced by detainees in the Laogai , with an obvious slashing of labour costs that leads to unfair competition with respect to European goods .
Sustainable development is anchored in the treaties ; it is an overarching objective for all European policies .
Mr President , Commissioner , I think it is very positive that we are talking about the Mediterranean today , the southern border of the European Union , and that we can hold a debate specifically on transport in the Mediterranean .
I now come to the last point mentioned : stem cells and research on embryos and cloning .
Our thanks , in any case , go to Mr Fiori : we believe that his is an important piece of work , especially if our major amendments are accepted ; it will be a good basis for reflection from now onwards and for preventing major discoveries from becoming patented property for the use and consumption of the powerful rather than being placed at the service of all human kind .
I would like to make this very clear so that what will probably be the biggest contentious issue during your Presidency is perfectly clear between us right from the start .
This is where the information comes from .
Europe is not heading towards the information society , we are already there .
It is an irony that , only eight years ago , the Millennium Development Goals were agreed upon in New York .
Its communications with us may not always have pleased everyone concerned , but it was always helpful and , above all , it spoke to me at the various levels , which cannot be said of the Council Presidency .
I am very pleased , in fact !
I would like to comment briefly on the question of an energy tax .
This wide scope is essential , as all flag states under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea are responsible for the vessels flying their flags .
Thank you very much .
Mr President , I believe I made it abundantly clear that with the exception of one isolated case we were not aware of any complaints and that we have now taken preventive action .
Who is it that refuses to support such a move ?
This is something that we in this House must emphatically reject .
Mr President , the North Caucasus was a victim of tsarist colonial policy and of attempts at genocide by the Stalinist regime .
In the same way , the Council obviously regrets the increases in the level of payment appropriations that Parliament intends to vote for , all the more so since this level of appropriations exceeds the Commission &apos;s draft budget .
Rights must be attached to the individual and the individual must take the rights with him wherever he goes .
But we must ensure that we have sufficient checks and balances to protect citizens from state terrorism or abuse of data by the state , the Union , or by journalists , organisations , individuals , or agencies for that matter , those who steal or otherwise come into possession of information which is private and confidential .
But such plans need resources in order to be effective .
I do not quite understand what is so problematic about it .
This mainstay of the European unification process , the Commission &apos; s right of initiative , must stay .
It always strikes me , when I arrive in the United States or Australia for example , that the border controls there are much stricter than in Europe .
One important point not contained in the Agricultural Committee report is that young farmers need to be given a basis on which to develop alternative , organic , family holdings , given that over @-@ intensive farming leads nowhere except to mad cows .
I am proud to be associated with this step and I shall be very interested to hear from the Commissioner , who is here today , whether the Commission intends to respond positively to this request by Parliament .
For stateless nations , community identification through sports becomes very difficult .
I also believe that any changes to the allowances payable to Members of this House from the time they were elected in July 1994 be put to the House , rather than imposed by any Bureau of 15 to 16 people .
I wish you all well .
I will repeat what I just said : &quot; the Commission considers there are no imperative reasons why it should raise any objections , as the contested patent does not infringe essential ethical rules and concerns the field of application which can be granted to a patent relating to a DNA sequence &quot; .
I feel it is important for the Council not to view this as set in stone . Rather , it should endeavour to ensure that the plan evolves in line with United Nations resolutions providing for the population to vote in a referendum on self @-@ determination for Western Sahara .
I ask the House to think very carefully about what they are doing here .
We can do that separately and at different times .
I agree with the rapporteur that the main focus must be on combating poverty and safeguarding the availability of basic services , and that the priority is support for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
In 1968 , it was the police who were chasing after you , and now it is you who are chasing around Paris behind the police &apos; .
I would like to point out that some 15 years ago the town in which I live had the worst air pollution problem of any town or city in Austria , and that by the introduction of new technologies the emission of industrial pollutants were reduced to a mere 10 % of the previous level . Furthermore , the industry in question is now in better shape than it was then .
It is not normal for a country that embarks on the democratic electoral process not to be supported in its consolidation .
Fuels used for transport purposes are taxed more heavily than if used for heating .
This year we must devote ourselves to their implementation . This target is an economic and environmental challenge of exceptional long @-@ term importance .
A functioning European Parliament depends to a large degree on a good uniform statute being in place .
Question No 64 by José Apolinário ( H @-@ 0173 / 98 )
Madam President , we were unable to approve the report by Mr Orlando on the implementation of international agreements to combat organized crime , because , according to an excellent text by the Council , the Parliament desired systematically to transfer the prerogatives of the Council to the Commission .
I call on the Iranian authorities to release unconditionally Ms Abdi and Ms Safazadeh and drop all charges against them and their fellow women &apos;s rights campaigners .
And I proposed that the European Parliament should abandon its work in Strasbourg .
It is regrettable that the Fisheries Committee was forced into this position once again .
However , ladies and gentlemen , I have some unpleasant news .
Nevertheless , I would like briefly to refer to the factor which gives rise to this directive : the energy efficiency of cars .
They are enormous responsibilities because they relate to the way people will lead their lives over the coming decades .
Biodiversity is a central issue in terms of sustainable development and the integration of environmental considerations into other policy areas .
The Rome Statute underlying the criminal court should not be undermined , weakened or watered down .
I appeal for the support of every Member , otherwise we shall make our Parliament look ridiculous .
Work is a part of our everyday lives and is critical for the dignity , welfare and development of a person .
These are the reasons why I voted in favour of the report .
Mr Wathelet is a little sad ; he has the impression that too little has been done . He should see Parliament &apos;s gesture of granting EUR 570 million to the Member States , rather than assigning this money to ITER , as an act of gratitude to the Belgian Presidency .
Faced with this European deficiency , some Member States have taken decisions , either to ban cultivation or to ban importation .
- Motion for a resolution
The measures have not yet been implemented , however , and they , too , require high levels of investment and will make vehicles more expensive .
The Commission proposal has two main parts .
I suggest that perhaps the person whose fingerprints are really on this is not here to answer that tonight .
I do not wish to be misunderstood .
On this point , I would like to emphasise the need to build a bridge over the Straits of Messina .
I shall give you a couple of examples .
. We recently adopted the biomass action plan and a communication on biofuels .
– Mr President , even though there is no doubt that it has a number of good or interesting points – not least the way it makes clear that Turkey is not ready for Europe and also that it probably never will be – I voted against the Eurlings report , and I did so on the grounds that the Turkish Government is doing nothing more than indulging in window @-@ dressing , in that it has agreed on a few reforms , albeit without implementing them , not to mention the fact that we are not getting any closer to solving certain problems with considerable potential for doing damage , such as the conflict over Cyprus , the Kurdish problem or the acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide .
I should also like to point out that , despite the simplifications and changes decided under Agenda 2000 , there is still a serious take @-@ up problem and appropriations are not turning into payments .
I think it is transparently obvious , however , that the Council ’ s administrative budget has increased at a rate of almost 5 % in relation to the budget for 2004 , in which the overall increase for all the institutions is one of 3 % .
Approval of Minutes of previous sitting : see Minutes
It is indeed time for sustainable and robust action .
The reason is that the problem is still growing and the European Union is not showing enough determination .
They are expected to uphold the boycott and embargoes .
I would like to see us have leading women in top posts regularly in the future , and a lot more than now .
For example , what exactly divides institutional and professional investors from private investors ?
Only those small and medium @-@ sized enterprises that are inventive and creative can survive tough competition .
I can reassure him , however , as regards the moratorium on the death penalty .
Solidarity with the new Member States , but under certain conditions .
The next item is the election of the Quaestors of the European Parliament .
We intend to keep pushing the process forward , through the Structural Funds , the Research Framework Programme , the European Employment Strategy , the new EQUAL Initiative and the new Social Action Programme which we hope to adopt in the summer .
I would recommend that the House also reject the amendment along these lines proposed by the UEN .
Once we know the Council &apos;s intentions , then we can make some decision as to what to do ourselves .
In the past , it was often the case that only the French or those on the left @-@ wing who were in favour of strong state control spoke up in support of industrial policy .
Balancing time dedicated to study with the time needed for sport is a challenge that we need to meet for our children as soon as possible , as it will enable us to ensure that they have a good quality of life in the future .
Let us not forget , however : protection of our fundamental rights can , in practice , vary from one individual to the next .
A specific Internet governance infrastructure needs to be created , so as to safeguard its security , integrity and authenticity and reduce the possibility of cyberspace attacks .
Regulations should have been introduced in many areas at a much earlier stage and we have often called for this to happen in this House .
I have heard nothing on this matter .
Therefore , I voted against this report .
Sort that out , and everything will be fine .
It will affect the companies , and - as national enterprises become European enterprises - the work of trade unions as well .
It will provide the financial contribution for pilot projects , for research and monitoring , for strategic actions by European networks and partnerships , for European organisations aiming to set up &apos; platforms &apos; , and for technical and administrative assistance in various sectors .
The question is , what can we do about it ?
For these reasons , we shall be voting against the report and the proposal for a Council directive .
The Commissioner has dealt to some extent with some aspects of that case .
It is a scheme that should enhance our security in terms of water resources , geology and fire protection and also enable us to make use of energy generated on the ground .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to subscribe to what the previous speakers have said and at the same time express my indignation at and disappointment with our own attitude .
In my country alone , Austria , 8 % of the gross domestic product is apportioned to investments from abroad .
In this regard , the most important indicator is the rate of employment , which is more revealing , and gives a better measure of the sustainability of public finances , than the unemployment rate .
It includes cooperation outside the EU .
I hope that we get there .
- Before the vote :
In addition , the risk of erosion of state revenue will become a real threat , which is certainly not a good thing in times of budgetary constraint .
Any hidden agenda has the potential to distort , if not destroy , these relations .
In my view , the Commission should eliminate any differences in treatment for the various species that are not fully justified as a matter of urgency , and I would also like to point out that progress has been made in these fisheries and that the Community fleet is already implementing many measures that are not , however , implemented by other non @-@ European fleets fishing in the same areas .
I have received five motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 108 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
I welcome the new Belgian law on quotas for female representation in companies and on company boards , as well as the tremendously proactive approach displayed on this matter by Mrs Reding and President Buzek even in the press on the other side of the Atlantic .
I would just like to remind Mr Wurtz that Mr Milosevic was the force behind his political family .
( Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment )
I would like to thank Mrs Kolarska @-@ Bobińska for her presentation , for bringing together the contributions from her fellow Members in an intelligent way and for the establishment of priorities , which is something that I personally feel is important .
I support the Commission proposal to phase out State aid in 2014 for the pits which are not competitive by that date .
This House made its position on this quite clear at first reading .
Without this access , the goal of achieving a fully integrated and functioning EU internal energy market by 2014 will be undermined .
The President @-@ in @-@ Office gave the impression that this would be the case .
I should like to just briefly comment on them .
We now refuse to give an Intergovernmental Conference the right to decide for us all .
Look at the anger .
Before introducing new legislation which puts additional burdens on business , it is suggested that business itself should enhance security of personal data by using security systems such as encryption .
It is just not acceptable that , having appointed a special envoy , he should be vetoed by Mr Milosevic for three years , and that during that time , a whole series of Community political representatives should troop off to Belgrade .
Mr President , the Commission fully supports the resolutions tabled by the different groups in the European Parliament .
It is time the people of the UK had a referendum on its relationship with this place so they can be the people who decide their destiny , not unelected bureaucrats .
Having said that , Commissioner , I think that your new initiative to start a working group on media pluralism is an excellent one and we , in Parliament , will obviously be extremely happy to discuss that initiative and work with you on it .
The Gothenburg Protocol to the Convention on Long @-@ range Transboundary Air Pollution was signed in December 1999 , i.e. six months after the Commission submitted its proposal for national emissions ceilings .
As I mentioned previously , we only have the possibility of saying yes or no , and that obviously imposes relatively significant limitations on the extent to which Parliament is able to collaborate in shaping the vote .
This country is afraid it will be in a sense sidelined .
So , here we are at the very first hurdle towards that , and I do not think it is time now to fail in this European Parliament .
Control of San José Scale ( codified version ) ( vote )
Let us follow this closely and maintain contact on these issues , not only with the Mexican government , but also with social organizations which have to face reality on a daily basis .
Since the Second World War , the fundamental principle in international relations was that aggression must not pay , or that political concessions should not be made to aggressors , but Moscow has been victorious and NATO humiliated , with the EU playing both sides .
It is the case that democracy and the capacity to act have been created with the removal of the third pillar and that with the new decision @-@ making methods in the Council for the expansion of codecision , the capacity to act has been improved .
However , I believe we must convince the people of the European Union that freedom of establishment is not a hollow expression which ultimately applies in full to tourists , rather , they must understand that for people who work , or have worked - firstly in terms of the insurance system and then in terms of the pensions system - freedom of establishment is a reality , and not a hollow expression .
The fishermen are on our streets in Brussels and in our Member States .
I think that we need to find a way to encourage the Council to see that adopting the definitive VAT system involves more than just calculating exactly what each Member State collects , and to bear in mind that the Member States have a lot to gain from the establishment of a definitive system .
However , I hope that everyone who has been involved in this process has learnt some lessons along the way concerning the principles of better regulation .
Finally , as a citizen of Portugal and a native of the Algarve , I am hopeful that the forthcoming QSF @-@ IV for 2007 @-@ 2013 will continue to allow the Algarve region to benefit from structural operations , even in the context of an enlarged Europe .
Mr President , first I would like to thank the rapporteur for the very useful suggestions put forward in detail in this report .
That is why I voted against this report .
Though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on , it is evident that we will watch very carefully how EC law is applied by national authorities and courts .
It is a very successful , active and dynamic campaign .
Democracy is also precisely the answer in the struggle against talebanisation .
I declare an interest in this because I was a member - a working member - of the High Level Group .
By failing to adopt the report , we have unfortunately thrown away this chance .
I hope that the Commission is able to guarantee that the EU will continue to support these courageous people .
It has frequently been called the greatest humanitarian crisis in history and has been compared to the genocide which took place in Rwanda in 1994 .
In all humility , I should like to state that , right now , the European Union is playing a greater political role than it has ever done before .
This combination has proved to be the best way of stopping drug abuse .
It is one of the tasks of the Temporary FMD Committee under the dynamic leadership of Mrs Redondo Jiménez to look into this and to publish a report on this subject later on in the year .
I would therefore ask my fellow Members to vote for the amendments in Block I , and I think that although one or two Members might feel uncomfortable about the outcome of the conciliation process , by and large , this report is acceptable .
There is not and never will be a military solution - Mr Schultz said that too , and every now and then I must refer even to him - and I must say that undoubtedly there will never be a military solution that resolves the problem in the Holy Land .
The clear purpose of this process of codification is to make EU law more accessible and comprehensible for the European public .
Konrad Schwaiger &apos;s excellent report , resulting both from your request for modification of the Regulation and the visit to Sarajevo on 21 February made by the delegation led by Tom Spencer , will definitely enable the process of reconstruction to be speeded up , but I consider that this remains largely insufficient .
This is in Finland &apos;s interests , especially as far as agricultural policy is concerned .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank Mr Jørgensen for the report .
The proposal by Mr Frattini concerning the introduction of packages of legal @-@ entry quotas could , I think , facilitate a reduction of illegal migration within the European Union , but it could also result in more effective control over illegal migration in third countries .
This situation demands that we ensure that cohesion programmes are properly implemented , since they are an important , powerful lever for helping the real economy , particularly for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises and for jobs .
Here too , as in Georgia – as we discussed in the previous debate – we see that Russia is not using its influence to stabilise , but unfortunately to destabilise the situation .
In the mean time , therefore , we must be particularly rigorous and demanding with regard to the existing control mechanisms and pay particular attention to the control of intermediaries , compliance with embargos and increasing the transparency and parliamentary control of those exports .
We have responsibilities towards it , just as we do to all other basin regions that border us .
Amendment 12 calls into question the proposal for a regulation based on the criterion of age .
Heavy corruption of officials is well known to occur , and the governments of the countries to which such companies belong seem to care very little about the welfare of Guinea &apos;s citizens , and only start complaining about the appalling human rights situation in the country when their financial interests are disrupted or threatened .
The moment that you and your Commissioners leave , the Union &apos;s citizens will begin to have faith in a Europe that is courageous and transparent enough to dismiss you . And by going , you will enable the Europe in which you believe to move forward .
It is all a matter of how the EIT fits into the current jigsaw .
It is long overdue .
So this is not a question of a lack of confidence in the relevant Commissioner , but rather an attempt to make it clear that the action plan he produced in conjunction with Parliament during the 1998 discharge one year ago is precisely the right answer to the problems before us , so that we as the Committee responsible and as Parliament wish to incorporate the first results from this action plan in our discharge procedure .
That said , the process has for a long time been fragmentary , not to say chaotic , resulting in a whole mosaic of provisions .
Why ? The truth of the matter is that the problems of Europe are so profound that the European Union &apos;s Heads of Government need to get together once in a while to talk about those problems in a preliminary way without having the pressure of microphones put under their noses immediately they come out of the meeting and being questioned about what they have been doing for the last hour and a half .
The reinstatement of the farming line and the significant effort envisaged for rural development must both be welcomed , unlike the unacceptable reduction in appropriations requested to the detriment of the tobacco sector , which is extremely fragile in terms of employment .
Health and safety at work is one issue where EU legislation has a real effect on a person &apos;s normal working day .
( 3 ) These EU @-@ wide recommendations do not take into account the different approaches relating to freedom of information in Member States .
He will say &apos; no , you cannot , you are not able , it is not enough &apos; , just like Mr Krugman said to Mr Steinbrück , and Mr Krugman has won the Nobel Prize in economics . If it were me saying this , you would say that I did not know what I was talking about , but it was Mr Krugman who said it .
It would go against the logic of simplifying the EU &apos;s external financial instruments .
Elderly people are particularly reliant upon public transport .
The five @-@ year action plan is there to implement the good intentions which the Commission formulates .
Mr Verheugen , you may have noticed that on 23 March the European Parliament indicated its desire for a substantially greater proportion of women Members of the next Commission than there is at present .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to conclude by thanking all those who worked together to produce this report .
What particularly concerns us at the moment , as it does you , is the disappearance of Mr Cubreacov , one of the leaders of the opposition , the man who in fact visited you , Mr Sacrédeus .
But we in the Union and our associated states are also accomplices , in that we are responsible for weapons reaching the Sudan so that the crisis can continue .
Unfortunately , the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice has not been applied uniformly in the Member States .
It is absurd that as part of the agreement , the EU should pay money to the governments of those countries in order to help the fishermen to find other jobs .
From this point of view , may I make a request of you , which is at the same time a question : could no completely new path of hope exist for the vitality , economic as well as social and cultural , of our various countries in Europe , in recourse to research , as was demanded at the conferences in Copenhagen and Peking , to evaluate the unwaged work of women at home .
Many people , especially younger people , lose sight of that or choose to ignore it .
Only one thing needs to be said , and I will conclude on this point : there are 200 000 Roma in Italy .
In fact only Sweden and the United Kingdom have such a scheme .
Many of my constituents are already watching the thermometer with a real sense of dread .
Developing countries should take appropriate mitigation actions to curb the growth of their emissions to 15 @-@ 30 % below business as usual by 2020 .
Today we are naturally focused on global challenges , including the economic and financial crisis and climate change , as well as regional issues .
( DE ) Madam President , it has been said here that it is not the euro that is in crisis , but the Member States that have got into debt .
We must progress from words to actions so that this situation is not repeated every year , as is currently happening , with ever greater violence and increasing numbers of victims .
It is therefore excessive to focus this exclusively on developing countries , particularly if it is later specified that it is not allowed to be carried out in places such as the Far East .
Thousands of Iberian oak and holly oak trees are in the throes of death .
In addition , control of national grids is being shifted from the Member States to the Commission , thereby cutting the potential for national energy planning in order to reduce energy dependency and ensure the needs of each Member State are satisfied .
The Government must address the issue of car registration immediately and should do so in the next budget .
There are many areas where we - to a greater or lesser extent - lack sufficient insight into how matters stand .
In fact , this is a necessary prerequisite to achieving these objectives in a coherent way .
In 2004 , new legislation was adopted on the protection of intellectual property , and 2003 and 2004 saw the adoption of new legislation on customs action against goods suspected of infringing certain intellectual property rights .
President , first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ahern , Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt and Mrs Jackson for their words of support in relation to the White Paper .
We also have to remember that sometimes aviation is the only possible transport mode , linking the EU with remote regions .
I would also conjecture that a leader of a European country went to Belgrade to see Milosevic .
If Mr Nassauer and Mr Tannock want to produce another report , they will have to start from the very beginning , and we will vote on it five years from now .
It is a special country to be joining , and the EU will have a special responsibility to make sure afterwards that all the other countries in the Western Balkans will be able to join too .
How paradoxical it is , too , that Commissioner for Communication Mrs Wallström , who took part in the debate , had a ten times higher profile with her previous portfolio - that of the environment – than with this one , which should however thrust her centre @-@ stage .
We are also ready to consider , with the Member States , mobility @-@ related measures and increased market access .
I come from a country close to the Balkans and remember the Kosovo intervention .
I am grateful to the honourable Member .
He demonstrated clearly to me that the Romanian Government , through its Prosecutor General , had repeatedly intervened on one side – allegedly under instructions from President Iliescu – of the civil case against Carol &apos;s half brother , ex @-@ King Michael of Romania .
For us , this illustrates the fact that , despite its proclamations , the European Parliament , cut off as it is from the people , is the weak link in the chain of civil protection and bends too easily under pressure from foreign interests .
This concludes what I wanted to say , whilst emphasising the pertinence of the questions that you have asked and bringing you up to date with the most recent developments in this matter .
author . - Mr President , in short , I am disappointed with the Commission &apos;s response to our oral question .
A glimmer of hope is offered by the proposals adopted today for providing aid to the most vulnerable countries , the developing countries .
There are already proposals on the table , as the Baron Crespo report that we are to discuss later today underlines .
That is no way to restore confidence !
We want to help the population , not the regime .
If we are to recommend discharge , there must be some very good explanations .
The use of such cells has led to positive results in treating patients with blood disorders such as leukaemia .
The majority of reasons banks use to continue charging handling costs , such as the cost of personnel , insurance , storage and so on , are reasons that would also be valid excuses for levying a charge for changing a 100 000 lira note into ten 10 000 lira notes .
Finally , EUR 350 billion in subsidies currently go to fossil and nuclear energies .
I view the Greens &apos; amendment as an attempt to defend existing structures and a social model that have entrenched unemployment in the EU .
I would be grateful if the Commissioner would reiterate that for the benefit of Members who were not present at yesterday &apos;s debate , because a great many people were coming into the Chamber when Mr Bangemann had us in thrall with his speech .
Some of the Cornillet report &apos; s recommendations are undeniably positive .
This is wrong !
I should like to know why the Council has decided against implementing all these specific examples on which Parliament and the Commission have worked so hard .
For that I thank Mr Watson for his good recommendation that I appear less on television and come here instead .
That brings us to the end of the list of speakers .
The Treaty , the Charter of Fundamental Rights and , soon , accession to the European Convention on Human Rights , will provide us with new tools in this area and will enable the European Union and its Members to reach a new stage .
On a final note , we hope that next year , the Commission and the Council will take initiatives in order to address the isolation , particularly of an economic nature , of Northern Cyprus .
There is the Nice system , based on a scale , and there is the draft Constitution system , based on a double majority : a majority of the Member States and a majority of the represented population , which we have set at 60 % .
This deduction is justified because the risks incurred in these operations are in the end borne by the re @-@ insurance company which is assumed to be an external third party .
They are not making so many incredibly complicated demands .
If that is not a lack of respect for human life , I do not know what is .
The consent issued does not cover the processed non @-@ viable products derived from these soyabeans since these are not organisms and are therefore not covered by the directive .
The sustainable management of radioactive waste and spent fuel must include the waste &apos;s life cycle ( from generation to temporary or final storage , as well as during the post @-@ closure period of the storage facilities ) and restoring the environment .
. Madam President , I congratulate the rapporteur and all who have helped him in this work .
This is where a decision about the multi @-@ annual plan will be an important credibility test , and hence the great significance of us in this House being able to take a stand tomorrow , which we are in a position to do probably thanks to the remarkable work of our rapporteur , in respect of which we have given the necessary means to be able to realise the enlargement but also – and we owe this again to the rapporteur ’ s proposals – make the new policy in the Union possible .
Peace is inextricably linked with justice , and that is where the problem lies .
We can only be delighted at the determination not to let our countries be subject to the domination and even in certain market segments to the monopoly of the American giant Boeing @-@ McDonnell @-@ Douglas .
They have the cheek to come up with their own interpretation of the results in terms of dissatisfaction with existing governments in the two countries .
Let me now turn to the fifth and last point regarding the Commission &apos;s role in promoting exchanges of best practice involving policy on domestic workers .
The figures speak for themselves ; policy @-@ makers need to be particularly aware of this group of people .
Whoever thinks that the British Empire or the French and German powers can still exist is living under a vain illusion .
It is well known that there are startling differences in the quality of cancer treatment facilities , screening programmes , evidence @-@ based best practice guidelines , facilities for radiotherapy and access to new anti @-@ cancer drugs , which also explains the big differences in the five @-@ year survival rate from most cancers across Europe .
In other words , is it possible that my country will have to return money to the European Union and the Commission ?
I can therefore only suggest that the information you require can be obtained from the Commission , if anywhere .
In moderation , Europe has so far always adapted its resources to fit in with its objectives .
I would also like to thank my fellow Member , Mr Lehne , for his approach .
If European economic policy is to be a success and the European social model is to subsist , the competence of the Union in the important areas of the internal market in the broadest sense , the four freedoms - namely financial services , competition , customs and monetary policy - must be retained and the report rightly emphasises this .
I appeal to the House not to support this report – and not merely to abstain from voting , which is what we have just heard the Social Democrats recommending and not to endorse the amendments calling for a tougher line on Iran from the Europe of the Nations Group , to which Mr Kristovskis belongs .
We think it is wrong to talk about the Commission &apos; s liability as an institution .
Fortunately , however , there are some Member States with which we can work well and we have demonstrated that today .
I shall quote one in his absence on his behalf - &apos; Just for a handful of silver he left us , just for a ribbon to stick on his coat &apos; .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
How can a locomotive be made to cross a border when it might not be perfectly suited to the network on the other side ?
At the moment our efforts in Africa for example are to quite some extent in vain as the People &apos;s Republic of China is exercising &apos; political dumping &apos; , when providing aid with no requirements for transition to democracy , rule of law and respect of human rights .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , on a point of order , under Rule 160 of the Rules of Procedure , our group has requested that we have roll @-@ call votes today on everything , and I know that has excited some interest in the Chamber .
Mr President , Rule 166 states very clearly that you are required to give us a response to complaints such as those already made by my colleagues , Mr Batten and Mr Knapman , concerning violence used against our members of staff by your members of staff .
In other words , subsidiarity in our view is not a simple decentralizing process , shedding some powers in favour of Brussels , whilst according it legitimacy for the most part .
Errors of legality and regularity are increasing too .
Recognising this does not mean removing the Member States &apos; competences , but asserting that with a broader and more cohesive view of the employment issue we can work with greater efficiency to address one of the most important matters of our time .
It was not made very clear in the Court of Auditors report whether administrative shortcomings were restricted to those countries receiving Community aid or the Community &apos; s administration itself .
Amendment No 3 tries to establish ISO standard 11292 as binding for the determination of the free and total carbohydrate content in soluble coffees .
We are currently establishing criteria , priorities and the IT platform with the Member States .
– Mr President , everyone knows that agricultural production is vulnerable to climate conditions .
Secondly , the language and style adopted by the German Government over the last six months have at times caused me to feel ashamed in the European Parliament .
The new strategy must serve to ensure the peace , stability and prosperity of the Black Sea region , and to guarantee the energy security of the EU .
In my opinion , this is something that should be rejected vigorously in the interests of the European institutions .
Secondly , in the measures to assist beef producers who have lost money , will he be proposing that all beef producers who have suffered serious loss will be compensated .
Yes , Mr Beazley , but after Mr Paisley , who had requested the floor first .
I hope that you and the Commissioner , after yesterday evening with all the political excitement of amendments and voting , ended the day with a nice glass of French , German , Spanish , Portuguese or Italian wine , a little bit of agriculture .
The successive wars between 1993 and 1999 did nothing to improve the situation , and opened the floodgates to the scourge of corruption .
So it could be vital for the Commission actually to expand the Community loans facility , and I would urge the Commissioner to act on this .
China &apos;s determination to play a more important role in the international arena must be accompanied by new responsibilities in the field of human rights , in the social sphere and in relation to environmental protection .
The situation is made all the more absurd by unnecessary local costs .
Most of the loose cash is virtual &apos; funny &apos; money , which is now returning to the banks &apos; balance sheets as a series of write @-@ offs .
That is the situation in which we find ourselves at the moment and , like yourselves , I believe it must be accorded due importance because , if it is indeed an important milestone in applying our model for coordinating economic policies , we ought not to attempt to draw conclusions of a kind which the Commission never of course intended .
Mr President , like the election of a Pope , I hope we will be able to say this evening &apos; Habemus Papam ; habemus Commission &apos; , but one area that concerns me and a lot of people is that in the Lisbon Treaty , we were to appoint a President of the Council to give clarity .
There is nothing to stop EU fishing fleets fishing in Papua New Guinea waters and landing their catch and getting their catch canned in Papua New Guinea - and , as has been said earlier , that would be very good for development , and indeed we should encourage it .
Alan &apos;s career personally symbolises the outstanding reputation of the BBC for integrity and objectivity .
As a representative of a new Member State , this situation with driving licences actually came as a big surprise to me since in Latvia , my country , we started issuing plastic licences of the size of a credit card two years after regaining independence .
The proposed changes are certainly commendable .
It will throw thousands out of work , devastating and blighting the future of all those families and communities in the interests of American multinationals , who appear to buy their influence through donations to American politicians , who are waging an economic war against some of the poorest communities in the Caribbean .
They want an agriculture that respects the environment , that meets high standards with regard to quality , traceability , food product safety and carbon footprint .
One of the five major objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy is combating poverty and , as such , it was necessary to analyse poverty amongst women in the EU .
It should be international institutions that identify impending danger .
Earthquake in El Salvador
That was the basis for the reasoning and you are quite right to raise it .
That is why the proposal for the review of the strategy proposes a new improved governance process .
Can the Council indicate what funds have been disbursed by the European Union with a view to halting the cultivation of drugs in Afghanistan for the year 2004 and what funds the European Council envisages that it will disburse in this specific policy area over the next two years ?
The convention , while not altering the institutional construction of the EU , does , however , add another court , the European Court of Human Rights , which will keep watch over the way in which the Union fulfils its obligations in relation to the provisions of the ECHR .
I would like to thank all those who have played their part in putting this compromise together .
It should be noted , in connection with the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding , that the reform of the electricity market in Ukraine is the most important single issue : whether the electricity is produced from nuclear power stations or thermal power stations .
It is not , therefore , very helpful if we sit here discussing our long lists .
However , in order for scientific fisheries research to meet the objectives set out and the needs indicated , it is vital that the necessary resources , including funding , are made available by the EU and by each Member State .
How sad to hear in this House that although democracy has not been established by a particular government and human rights are not fully respected , nevertheless relations with that government must be privileged !
The problem we face in this case is like that which would arise from the introduction of patents in my own field .
The review will form part of the first report on the new integrated programme for clean air , which the Commission is in the process of drawing up .
On the other hand , online games of chance are often played outside the territory of a single country .
If we want to re @-@ establish contact between Europe and its people , and I will say this once more , we must get rid of the feelings of remoteness and powerlessness the people feel in relation to Brussels .
Mr President , I voted for the Commission &apos;s discharge in connection with the implementation of the EU budget for 2007 .
The idea of responsible technological progress , moreover , is one of the main axes of the action plan on issues involving science and society which the Commission will shortly be announcing .
Secondly , how does the Council evaluate the situation in neighbouring Georgia where serious violations of human rights are on the increase again ?
We also want to make sure that next year , when Parliament comes back after the European elections , that we can have a properly organised system for information technology , which is why we will be voting to clear all the credits out of reserve on information technology .
As he is not yet here , I urge the House to deal with the competition reports .
This is fundamental , horizontal legislation that is going to be dealing with the whole Internet and its commercial viability .
The presentation is closed .
I asked for that to be minuted .
But there are quite a number of arguments against it .
Moreover , it should be clear that , once this directive has been adopted , it is up to the Member States to galvanise themselves into action .
So listen to the successes : in Bulgaria , the minimum wage is EUR 61 and in Romania it is EUR 69 , compared with EUR 1 173 in France and EUR 605 in Greece .
This will be particularly important in future .
Mr President , this is another occasion when we find ourselves looking into the situation in Azerbaijan .
The Commission has made considerable efforts in line with the 1996 commitments and its Plan of Action .
It is late at night and there are few of us but it is a small point of protocol .
But I want to start the first phase right here : to know the ground we stand on , to create a clear will for this change and then to try to bring closure to it .
- A6 @-@ 0104 / 2006 by Umberto Guidoni , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on the discharge for the implementation of the budget of the European Aviation Safety Agency for the financial year 2004 &#91; 2005 / 2118 ( DEC ) &#93; ;
We have lost count of the numbers of people who have suffered persecution and torture simply because of their sexuality .
None of them has yet been properly dealt with in what we have got before the House .
All that remains for me to do , therefore , is once again to call on Parliament to accept this important protocol so that trade standards may be amended in such a way as better to serve the interests of millions of human beings in the developing countries .
Today the new concept of sovereignty lies in subsidiarity : it is the sovereignty of local identities , the sovereignty of citizens , the sovereignty of those who must help construct a legal system to interpret in the best possible way the ever more varied and complex needs of an evolving society .
One can see images of nature with water , animals and snow .
But the situation is different in some other countries .
I am grateful to him once again for the work he has done on the issue of urban transport .
The new government &apos;s programme includes many priorities which do indeed correspond to the accession partnership , but we hope that the government will also succeed in transforming these priorities into concrete results .
The services which the European Commission insists on liberalising ?
The EU and the entire world must now rally behind this demand : free Perwiz Kambakhsh .
I completely understand that Europol needs to carry out internal adjustments , but it makes no sense for Parliament to issue its opinion , because , as an intergovernmental institution , Parliament does not play a relevant role in this institution &apos;s administrative decision @-@ making process .
Mr President , this vote is also a litmus test of whether the EU is a community of values or whether human dignity and human rights are under threat .
( FR ) There are questions that will not go away ; nor will the historic wounds that remain open in the Armenian community throughout the world .
But let me address some of the objections which have been raised , starting with those of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights - sadly Mr Casini is no longer here , but Mr De Clercq and Mrs Mosiek @-@ Urbahn are .
Finally , the Commission cannot accept the amendments to Article 8 that are aimed at prohibiting the use of gender as a factor when calculating insurance premiums and benefits for employee insurance schemes .
The task of the Aviation Safety Agency will be to approve aircraft , certify them and oversee their operation .
We in this House should now also demonstrate that we know how to stand up for our citizens and not be put under pressure by anybody .
Madam President , I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for his work on the extremely serious , topical issue of terrorism , which has recently been spreading with appalling , renewed vigour .
15 .
Mr President , we , the Members of this House , have just been very generous .
That you can count on my knowledge is not so certain .
Currently , in order for the citizens of the island of Gozo to cross over to the main island of my country , Malta , using a 12 @-@ minute helicopter trip , the market economy requires them to pay much more than they would pay for an airline ticket for a trip between London and Brussels .
The European harmonisation of social legislation in the realm of road transport is under way .
Having said this , let me also assure you that the Commission will continue to take account of the specific interests of the outermost regions in current , but also in future , negotiations of this nature .
It is now time to hold such an event because the momentum is there , and it is for a change in objectives .
If we were to have had this discussion in ten days &apos; time , after the decisive referendum - and my belief is that Ireland will say &apos; yes &apos; - the debate would have been even more concrete and optimistic .
The rapporteur has worked very hard and with the help of committed colleagues on the Committee has achieved a remarkable partial success .
The very fact that , in this plenary session , there are representatives of twenty @-@ five nation @-@ states holding discussions in their own languages is clear proof of an ability to coexist in equality and to respect common values .
For the umpteenth time , they congratulate the Turkish Government on its &apos; reforms &apos; and repeat the wish list for the Cyprus problem to be resolved , without daring to close the accession door to Turkey if it is not .
It is not possible to have normal relations with Turkey as long as it continues to torture and as long as it continues to oppress the Kurdish people .
And all without any support from the United States .
Let us , therefore , stick with that .
Mr President , Chancellor , Mr President of the Commission , as the end of this year and this presidency approaches , we cannot hide a certain feeling of disappointment .
Enlargement to the east will be an enormous rebuilding project , the largest that Western Europe has embarked on since the Second World War .
That agreement exists .
This phrase at least has the merit of showing that the European Parliament and the Commission are going to back each other up in order to increase their respective powers and trample on the decisions of the Council .
The Charter is designed to create a universal regulatory framework for small- and medium @-@ sized enterprises as defined at European level , and also to establish stages for implementing these measures .
In my opinion , this is a decisive challenge that clarifies the debate .
My primary concern , when engaging in these discussions , when voting , and when tabling amendments , has been to shape a directive that will be applicable throughout Europe , at the same level , and with the same ground rules .
Mr President , during the debate held in preparation for the election of the President of Parliament , I had the opportunity to say what I expected of the new President .
In terms of our internal procedures , we have , as you know , lost the &apos; Battle of Nice &apos; , which , to tell the truth , we were the only ones waging and , hence , we have to go back to the spirit of the framework agreement on relations between Parliament and the Commission which we adopted in July 2000 .
There is even a definite feeling in the air , it could be said , that failure is a real possibility .
In Oslo , at the conference to combat the use , production and stockpiling of cluster munitions , a young Lebanese man aged 24 , Ibrahim , whose body had been devastated by wounds , and who had an amputated leg , introduced himself , saying : &apos; Pleased to meet you , I am a survivor &apos; .
This weakness in demand poses an obstacle to economic recovery and to so @-@ called rational investment .
For another , the total market for chocolate products would probably decrease and thereby also , perhaps , the level of consumption of cocoa butter .
The joint debate is closed .
It is playing with fire and the European institutions must not turn a blind eye to it .
Once the Nordic countries have joined in the practical Schengen cooperation , the citizens of the Nordic countries will still have the right to travel within the territory of the Nordic countries and spend the night at hotels , camping sites etc. without having to show their passports .
Amendment 4 refers to double taxation , while amendments 13 and 22 ask for a one @-@ stop online solution in order to calculate registration taxes .
The appointment of Mr Van Rompuy as President of the European Council is the appointment of a clear opponent of Turkey &apos;s accession and I will quote him now , &apos; Turkey is not Europe and never will be Europe .
Among other serious aspects , this regulation intends to give the Commission the power to withdraw authorisations , to ask Member States to negotiate or reject bilateral investment treaties ( BITs ) and to approve new BITs .
At the same time it prevents people from losing out on social security because of these differences .
Many jobs are still insecure and 60 million people are living below the poverty line .
. ( IT ) Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Brok for his speech .
The European Parliament must exercise a supervisory role over these temptations .
On that subject , the European Union has to play a leading role in promoting the development of animal testing at international level .
Certain sensitizing and possibly allergenic substances should be marked even if they can only provoke a reaction in sensitized people .
That is compounded by the multiplicity of prices that will have to be displayed as this period overlaps that in which we shall be moving towards the single currency .
I wish to congratulate and thank Mr Tappin for his excellent work .
We will get there by this gradual , progressive approach .
However , it may also be used against non @-@ approved religious groups which , according to the Vietnamese authorities , engage in political activities or are potential elements of disunity .
The real issue here is that we want to fast track the passage and application of this important legislative package .
The changes to the programme proposed in Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz &apos;s amendments are therefore vital .
I therefore welcome your will to restore growth and to create employment as the be @-@ all and end @-@ all of your Presidency .
Colleagues were talking about priorities .
It is right to be as transparent as possible , but it is also right not to undermine the fundamental policies of the European Union .
Obviously , the directive on collective redundancy procedure must be reviewed and measures which afford greater protection for workers and for jobs must be included in it .
The transposition of the directive will therefore make it possible to offer better credit conditions in future , and to limit the risk of people taking on too much debt .
The notion that prevails in certain tourist areas that it is possible to coordinate holiday periods in Europe in such a way that these tourist areas can be at full capacity all year round is an illusion , and incidentally it would not have my support in any case .
This should be given careful thought , if we wish to make policy from the viewpoint of opposition or government politicians in our home countries , and not just from our viewpoint as Members of the European Parliament .
They coincide with the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty , which marks the end of the intergovernmentalism which has caused us problems for so many years and the exercising of a more integrated and cohesive policy .
Let us now follow its implementation very closely in order to keep to the principles which we have successfully negotiated .
If , with our new competence under the Treaty of Lisbon , we now want to develop a new European framework , we must be familiar with the data and also be able to exchange this data in a harmonised way .
In this context , this report represents a reaction to the financial crisis and its socioeconomic repercussions .
A significant problem in this situation is the lack of appropriate solutions concerning retirement pension entitlements for these women .
I voted against all of the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance on the G20 resolution in order to protest against that group &apos;s tactic of always reopening debates with generally demagogic amendments .
The losses total between EUR 200 billion and EUR 250 billion .
I would therefore like to urge you most strongly just to take the Lulling report - because it is urgent - without debate and to postpone the other reports , or alternatively to take them without debate as well .
We need to improve our capacity for turning what comes out of research into innovation , and to do so everywhere .
Thanks to compromise amendments drawn up jointly by the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , and thanks also to individual amendments tabled by Members of these groups , it seems to me that we have taken a number of important steps forward .
I could return the flattery and say that up until now I thought we were doing quite well , but it is beginning to get a little repetitive .
Sometimes , these discussions focus on the sugar sector and other times they home in on other sectors of the agricultural budget .
We should actually use the terms &quot; Member or Associate States &quot; . This is quite a small correction .
That remains my view .
It is good that the rapporteur devotes attention to the Palestinian issue , but why is there no mention of Israel &apos;s right to security ?
Experience in Portugal shows that this exemption is essential both to defend traditional gastronomy and its associated habits and customs , and to protect family enterprises , which represent a large part of the workers in this sector and which are the ones facing the most difficulties given the competitive imbalance with large groups .
It is therefore correct that the EU monitors very carefully any actions aimed at intimidating those who openly criticise the mistakes of government officials .
The President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council has referred to the fight against terrorism and it is clear that when freedom was attacked with the barbarity of 11 September it was perfectly demonstrated that in today &apos;s globalised landscape concepts of security , defence , diplomacy , trade , culture and religion are all interrelated and that this should be translated into a common awareness that , since the phenomenon of terrorism affects all of us equally , there must be a response that comes from all of us equally .
That possibility is the driving force behind economic reforms and democratisation .
The Committee of Inquiry &apos;s excellent report , drawn up by Mr Medina , has a twofold merit : firstly , it lays bare the responsibilities of all the main actors in this affair ; and , secondly , it proposes a set of measures designed to prevent such a crisis from ever happening again .
The healthcare workers are the backbone of our health systems and to them we owe more than words can express .
Let us make a humanitarian gesture !
In addition to the damage caused to sea water by pollution from ships , industrial pollution bears a huge share of the responsibility for the contamination of sea water .
The Commission expressed these doubts , and General Motors and Opel Trust are now reassessing the way in which the offer to buy Opel was made , and to verify whether , in fact , this offer was made on a commercial basis or not .
On that basis , then , could the Commission tell us how it views the idea of starting to give greater importance to the peculiar character of island regions ?
I would like to ask the Council if it intends to send European Union lawyers to Turkey to attend the trial and to help ensure that the trial is in fact fair , as you quite rightly said .
This year we wish to organise a day dedicated to the euro .
We are worried about the fact that the Edinburgh facility , the economic investment fund that was established in Edinburgh , has remained a dead letter .
Next time , please let us know within the prescribed time .
Given that Poland has requested assistance in respect of 189 redundancies at H. Cegielski @-@ Poznań and at four of its suppliers , all operating in the marine diesel engine sector , I voted in favour of the resolution , as I agree with the Commission &apos;s proposal combined with the respective amendments introduced by Parliament .
The proposed transparency of the services provided and of prices , which must be offered to travellers , is of course vital , as well as the total reimbursement of costs should the organizer become insolvent or bankrupt .
I agree with Commissioner Damanaki that we should not ask too much of our fishermen by on the one hand demanding that they make radical reforms while on the other liberalising trade .
Their use derives from historic and socio @-@ economic reasons that cannot be ignored by a simple ban .
But the key to this particular directive , or so I believe , is that the consumer must benefit to the full from technological advances in voice telephony .
In my opinion , we must welcome the text and call for this work to be concluded before the end of the year , before enlargement takes place , because this will make progress easier to achieve .
That point is also going to be included in the new regulation , and is a question which Parliament and the Council of Ministers will have to resolve .
On the one hand , they are all out for getting as much out of the Brussels money coffers as possible , but at the same time they struggle to find national co @-@ financing because those projects are not always a national priority .
In order to enhance the reliability of supplies , it is also necessary to enter into agreements with other countries .
In this context it would be possible for an applicant to present a project concerning a &apos; Voice of Europe &apos; .
Nevertheless , we have had to contend with what have proved to be particularly severe forms of food poisoning in various Member States in recent years and there is little or no supervision in the agro @-@ industry , which incorporates all manner of filth and rubbish into the food chain .
I refer in particular to Michel Kilo , Anwar al @-@ Bunni and Mahmoud Issa , who are still being detained for having signed in May the Beirut @-@ Damascus Declaration calling for the normalisation of relations between Lebanon and Syria .
Conclusion of the Protocol on Integrated Coastal Zone Management to the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment and the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean (
The BNP is a political party with its roots in neo @-@ Nazism .
For this reason , every attempt to improve formalities and general conditions and to combat tax fraud is to be welcomed , provided that the taxation sovereignty of the Member States is preserved and no attempt is made to harmonise tax rates by the back door .
Peace , stability , shared prosperity , and establishing a dialogue between cultures and civilizations , continue to be interdependent elements and they can only progress , as all of you have pointed out - and I am delighted at the consensus - to the extent that the three Barcelona objectives go hand in hand .
Alongside this threat , we do not have clarity as to who actually owns the sugar quota ; I think it is essential that the quota be vested in growers of beet .
The current system is a thousand times better .
In this situation I think it is quite unnecessary of us in the European Parliament to attack the Chinese population policy as one @-@ sidedly as in point 21 .
That is not in our hands , but in those of the contractor , who was not chosen by us .
I believe that her request for greater consistency and transparency for all is vital , as well as greater involvement by civil society in foreign policy .
But I would like to draw attention to the issues that somehow we have underestimated .
Today , we have other problems as well . This includes the import of soya meal , for example , which can contain salmonella .
Special reference is made to the role of women in rural society and the need to provide the social conditions necessary to support women who work outside the home and those women engaged in agriculture and other rural enterprises .
Regarding the vote on this resolution , my group asked for a certain number of votes by division , separate votes , as well as two recorded votes in order to avoid issues being mixed up , withdrawing from this resolution the points which had been unjustifiably added and which did not concern its direct objective : the transportation of horses .
It is not my habit to do so , and I apologise for not staying for the rest of the debate .
I am thankful that he took on board most of my concerns and even my criticisms .
Frischenschlager report ( A4 @-@ 0257 / 98 )
As a fundamental international player , the European Union cannot allow itself to stay one step behind in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energies in housing efficiency .
Now that the Treaty of Lisbon is in place , the three institutions - Parliament , the Council and the European Commission - will have to work together in a different way to how they have done up to now .
It is in our common interest to monitor the progress made in order to get a real picture of the situation .
Wait until we have implemented a policy which is operating satisfactorily .
Following many wars between the two countries , soldiers have been facing each other down , in summer and winter alike , at 6 000 metres above the sea , for 15 years .
These also feature a markedly higher turn @-@ out than European Parliament elections .
.
I should also like to say that , up to now , we have received more or less the same response from all countries in the Barcelona process guaranteeing their presence at the Valencia Conference .
There is nothing regarding the occasional transportation of horses .
I am being so critical because the Council , as one of our major community institutions , cannot and should not stand outside this debate .
However , it is up to Mr Herrero himself to give explanations to the House for an action that affects us all .
( NL ) Madam President , Commissioner Kroes , we are actually looking to you as an arbitrator in this case .

I have the feeling that the market here could affect the legitimate rights of these people to self @-@ determination , despite the promises of the United Nations .
For that reason , the Commission wanted to restrict access to justice to environmental organisations that meet certain conditions .
Once it has been said that European economic policy should have employment as its goal , once this is laid down in law and is proclaimed loud and clear , without ever checking the validity of the affirmation in a realistic and pragmatic way , then the subordination of the social to the economic is being written in the stone of the Treaties , finally reducing the social aspect to the task of managing each and every one of us in our competition for a place in a labour market which is getting tighter and tighter .
New Commissioner , Štefan Füle , who was a former colleague of mine when I was Europe Minister - and I would like to welcome him and congratulate him on his appointment - is going to be extremely busy with the enlargement issue as far as Croatia is concerned , because as soon as next week , we plan to hold an initial intergovernmental conference at ministerial level to open the chapters on fisheries and the environment , two very important chapters that , as you can imagine , will require an enormous amount of work and dedication .
We shall see .
But the truth is the truth – whether it is expressed by Agamemnon or his swineherd – and Mr Ortuondo , before launching into assertions and giving advice to others , should take a look at his own house , because , whether he likes it or not , the only politician responsible – and when I use the word responsible in this context I have serious doubts about a person who brings together an anti @-@ constitutional project which is intended to destroy the unity of Spain – has been the President of the autonomous government , from his own party .
In your report , you ask the Commission to resume negotiations with the Revolutionary People &apos;s Republic of Guinea as soon as this year , in order to reach longer @-@ term arrangements concerning our fishing relations with that country .

It is our goal that the participants of the Kimberley Process and Zimbabwe will intensify their efforts in order to forge consensus on this difficult issue , in the spirit of dialogue and cooperation that has always presided over this process .

When and how will it come ?
We are also sensitive to the needs of the European health systems , which are facing serious difficulties recruiting professionals to cover this on @-@ call time .
The debate is closed .
A final observation concerning the time of reply , which is too long : I do not know how , but we are going to have to study how to be quicker and more punctual .
You can therefore see , ladies and gentlemen , that these cultural industries are being supported only by EU programmes and actions .
The solution is therefore not to recognise the hybrid ultraliberal schizophrenic European system , but to challenge it in order to put forward a Europe of recovered identities , which applies protection and Community preference to Europeans first of all !
For these reasons , Mr Barroso , you will not have our vote of confidence tomorrow .
Mr President , Mr Duisenberg , we MEPs , as we have stated a number of times this evening , have a unique role to play in relation to the single currency because this Chamber here is the only place in which the people of Europe can have any democratic input into how their new currency is run .
The action plan would promote several measures against violence and illegal material on the Internet including , firstly , systems for labelling or rating material according to its level of violence , for example .
What else do they want ?
Mr President , you will remember that I challenged the referral of this affair to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
Under the Regulation , the Council is given information concerning the Agency &apos;s action programme , the general and special risk analyses that it prepares , an annual general report and the Agency &apos;s budget .
Although we appreciate that PVC is not the only issue here , we are ready to back those amendments which seek either to ban or to restrict the use of PVC .
As Mrs Schleicher has already indicated , particular attention must be paid to the points on which national parliaments have lost competences which have not been passed on to the European Parliament .
Worse still , we hear that &apos; substantial majorities &apos; of the citizens of these four Member States expect to be joining EMU in the foreseeable future .
Mr President , this draft legislation combines two aims .
I would like to begin with the institutional problems that this treaty has created .
Christians are citizens in their own right ; they have the same right to practise their religion as any other religious community .
( NL ) Madam President , Commissioner , rapporteur , ladies and gentlemen , I think that the proposal on the table is better than the document presented last time .
Whilst we condemn acts of heartless violence by Chechen terrorists , we also condemn the disproportionate use of military force and arbitrary acts by the Russian army .
And for this reason I would like to thank Parliament once again for the great support it is giving Directorate General XXIII .
Further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so @-@ called Five Wise Men .
We are about creating more efficiency and more effective transparency in the Union and we are about ensuring that the Union relates more to the concerns of the citizen .
But the Russian consumer cannot learn this from the bottle because the label is not written in Russian script .
You mentioned the EC @-@ China Joint Customs Committee .
I believe that this is a factor of importance .
France , for its part , has access to only 9 000 tonnes per year , of which only 700 tonnes come from the English Channel and the North Sea .
As Mr Seguro reiterated , this agreement will enable us to continue to support the process that has recently been initiated in Mexico .
Moreover , with fishery stocks becoming scarce , aquaculture is creating innumerable opportunities for European industries .
There are different situations in the different Member States . In some Member States , there are chiropractors , practitioners of different types of massage , non @-@ medical practitioners , acupuncturists , and so on ; and patients from other Member States must be provided with access to their services if they so wish .
However , it is not now just plain sailing .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my Party supports this resolution because we too wish to assist Croatia in developing the type of society which we in Europe accept as normal .
I think it is important that we definitely look for and try to find the best possible options but sometimes it is simply necessary to go step by step .
Many countries are still not properly implementing national legislation to ensure cleaner groundwater .
Indeed , one is tempted to say that such is the EU ’ s apparent awe of China that it avoided an opportunity during the year to sponsor a critical motion in the United Nations .
Subject : Enlargement
It is totally in the hands of Parliament , as it should be .
The question of minorities falls within the competence of the Member States , and therefore these communities must , for the most part , be satisfied with whatever they can negotiate with their own governments .
They must also be given the opportunity to do this .
I am happy , really happy , with what you said , Commissioner , about sharing the same concerns as the European Parliament , and that the European Commission views all the recommendations tabled by Parliament in the report positively and will do everything in its power to implement them .
In certain countries the Commission has also funded actions aimed specifically at road safety , such as the drafting of a highway code and the equipping of vehicle test centres , notably in Albania , and the introduction of rules for vehicle safety testing in Mali .
I am particularly pleased about the opportunity it gives countries to ban dangerous chemicals throughout their territories in order to protect their drinking water .
Electronic money institutions and credit institutions

What are our conditions for intervention by the European Union in Congo ?
In the field of external energy policy it is crucial to remember that a business that controls its market from generation to the final sale , as is the case for electricity , is not the same as another business whose product is dependent on factors that are largely out of its control , as is the case for gas .
The European Union would have to provide continuous monitoring and more consistently ensure the role of a flexible and effective centre , as it has , for example , in the verification and fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria .
Finally , I hope that the majority in the European Parliament will approve the amendment proposal which involves a ban on the use of genetic modified organisms in organic farming .
The fixed interest rate for late payments , proposed at 8 % , is an adequate deterrent for large firms too , the fixed 30 @-@ day payment period is balanced for supplier and purchaser , and the 30 @-@ day delivery verification period prevents abuse of the verification procedure for extending the payment period .
The Council regulation of 1995 perhaps focused in too exclusive a manner on the protection of tropical forests and not sufficiently closely on the harnessing of their productive potential .

In 2005 , the voters of France and Holland decisively rejected the constitution .
The Colombian Government recently confirmed that the NGOs have a legitimate role to play , but it has done little to put this policy into practice .

I had tried to demonstrate that the label on a pot of honey should above all inform consumers about the origin and quality of that honey , in order to prevent honey imported from who knows where containing who knows what pollen from being confused with quality honey produced by our beekeepers .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
It is not enough to raise human rights issues while still believing or pretending to believe that , in spite of all the alarming facts , Russia is continuing on its way to democracy , Russia is fulfilling its commitments to the Council of Europe signed ten years ago , demonstrating real progress in building a rule of law society and implementing the verdicts of the Strasbourg Court of Human Rights – verdicts which the Russian Government has so far ignored .
Currently , this data is collected on a voluntary basis by the majority of Member States .
That was the first demand .
One thing is certain : it shows that Parliament believes that we still need to think very carefully about this extremely sensitive issue .
As rapporteur I am presenting 92 amendments to you today for the revision of the OLAF regulation , with the request that you approve them .
Several judgments clearly indicate that the rules relating to equal treatment laid down in Community legislation not only prohibit explicit discrimination on grounds of nationality , but also prohibit any disguised form of discrimination by means of the application of differentiation criteria which have the same effect in practice .
At the moment , the Commission &apos;s current work programme is not consistent with the resolution adopted by the European Parliament for the annual political strategy or with the first reading of the European Parliament for 2007 .

Mrs McKenna &apos; s report offers us an opportunity to include radioactive substances .
When I hear Trakatellis I am reminded of what the martyr Jan Huss said when he saw people piling up the faggots to burn him to death .
( Applause )
The fact that the local elections in September produced the same results as the elections in March shows how the outcome of the March election is to be judged .
. It gives me real pleasure to be addressing the meeting today , because we are talking about two documents prepared by Parliament , by Members of this Parliament , by an outstanding member of the Committee on Petitions which I chair , Mr Hammerstein Mintz , and because we are also discussing a report prepared by Mr Cashman on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs – he is Vice @-@ Chairman of the Committee on Petitions and an outstanding member of it .

As for Mexico , the strategic partnership decided on by the Council will , I hope , soon be announced at a European Union @-@ Mexico summit .

The various Member States &apos; more or less panicky reactions faced with people &apos; s desire to find sanctuary and a new life in Europe have struck a very discordant note , given the humanitarian values the EU stands for .

I suggest that we need to guarantee that people &apos;s pensions will actually improve if they accept working for longer , particularly those who may be on small pensions .
Nevertheless , instead of having to witness the same mistakes at EU level , I should like to reduce the likelihood of that happening .
The Community &apos;s financial support for research in this sector must therefore not be reduced but should actually continue in parallel with the considerable effort being made by the government of the United States in respect of the restructuring of the American aerospace sector .
We therefore regard the development of less addictive alternatives to methadone as a hopeful sign which should resolve the remaining political difficulties in terms of the way in which the majority in the House views the drugs issue .
Mr President , in the public gallery we have a delegation from the Upper Austrian Parliament &apos;s Committee of Experts on Europe . I would like to welcome them very warmly .
One effective way to provide all children , including those from disadvantaged backgrounds , with the opportunity for lifelong learning , is to increase the quality of pre @-@ school education .
In spite of their tentativeness , the report &apos; s suggestions are sound : it calls for a better assessment of the effects of enlargement and considers the 0.45 % of Community GDP devoted to cohesion policy to be a minimum .
How should we honour their memory ?
It is vital to work together within the EU to strengthen the protection available to victims of xenophobic and racist crimes and to ensure that those responsible are punished and that we remove the loopholes in the law .
Are we any closer to a satisfactory solution ?
The Chinese authorities regard him as a criminal , accusing him of undermining the security of the state , and – without any evidence – of involvement in bomb attacks .
Europe is openly revealed as being powerless to manage its land and maritime borders .
That is unacceptable to many Members , myself included .
Secondly , there is the common definition of several serious infringements .
After decades of integration in the Community , the overseas departments are still ranked among the most disadvantaged in the European Union .
... is all very well , but what we need here is a serious policy .
I also understand that five teachers are to stand trial for taking part in a cross @-@ community choir which gave a performance in Istanbul .
Europe had already decided that these aircraft , fitted with a so @-@ called hushkit , should be phased out after 1 April .
Mr President , the arguments put to the European Parliament by the representatives of the Commission and the Council six months ago as the supposed case for eliciting our support for the customs union with Turkey are still ringing in my ears .
I am at the beginning of that journey , and this debate is extremely important to me in listening to the views that have been put forward .
In all likelihood , Switzerland would easily become a Member of the EU , given that it fulfils all of the accession criteria , but the fact is that the Swiss people have not wanted to join .
It was only the threat of a warning letter that led at last to a consistent austerity policy being at least hinted at in Germany .
There will have to be a follow @-@ up to the Tampere process .
The idea of the internal market must be adopted , realities acknowledged , geopolitical and geostrategic changes which have taken place in the world recognised and a model applied that already exists in the sectors of competition and trade , where experts work together across the Atlantic .
We have already come to a consensus on this . Unfortunately , this was not the case in the vote of the Committee on Regional Development .
On the other hand , like the European Parliament , the Commission would have liked to see the Molitor report demonstrate the connection which must be presumed to exist between the proposed simplifications on the one hand and competitiveness and employment on the other .
Lithuania is attempting to control the preaching of certain minority sexual orientations , no doubt wishing , and quite rightly so , to promote instead the family , consisting of a father , a mother and their children , which forms the fundamental unit of any society .
Mr President , the report on safety at Sellafield , published by the UK Nuclear Installations Inspectorate , is a damning indictment of safety at the plant and falsification of safety checks there .
Firstly , in relation to the issue at the heart of a number of contributions – whether we are looking backwards or forwards – it is the Irish presidency &apos;s humble task to accomplish the outstanding agenda items as far as it can .
Urban transport , in fact , generates 40 % of CO2 emissions and keeps Europe dependent on and &apos; hostage &apos; to the market in fossil fuels such as oil , which accounts for approximately 70 % of total demand .
This is why the area of security , freedom and democracy should be extended to include those European countries which increase Euroatlantic security .
Ladies and gentlemen , we now come to catch @-@ the @-@ eye .
It is clear that the petition raises an issue to which the Commission does not yet seem to have provided an answer .
Whilst we are on the subject of targets , we must break with the past performance , where the EU has a dismal record in failing to meet targets .
You said a moment ago that , whatever happens , none of this should fall into the hands of repressive authorities .
I should like to hope that Parliament &apos; s insistence on certain points being adopted will also help the Turkish side to understand , even if - as Mr Morillon rightly comments - it appears to be somewhat unwilling to understand , that the road towards Europe is not a one @-@ way street of determination and patient understanding on the part of the European Union in the face of Turkey &apos; s so @-@ called special circumstances ; it requires the same measure of determination on the part of the Turkish authorities and Turkish society to adjust to the rules of law and ethics which govern the European Union and which apply indiscriminately to all candidate countries ; rules which , unfortunately , continue to be violated by Turkey , not only when it comes to the Kurdish problem and its democratic shortcomings , but also in numerous other cases , such as the Cyprus question and Greek @-@ Turkish relations .
Nor can we say that one kind tastes better and another worse .
However , if electronic commerce is to develop , we require a sound user @-@ friendly and secure payment system .
As for Mr Fantuzzi &apos;s speech , I agree with his interesting comments on agricultural policy and the role of subsidiarity .
We are therefore pleased that the Resolution that we are to vote on takes up our proposal that the eradication of poverty in Latin America and contributing to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals there within the timescale set should be priorities within Euro @-@ Latin American relations .
But I am talking , say , about an American professor who accepts a chair at a German university , receives a residence permit for the Federal Republic of Germany and who , when he wishes to give a guest lecture at the Sorbonne in Paris has to apply for a visa , which he is possibly still waiting for because the French or German authorities are not making progress on it . This is because of the diverse and - for the lack of a strategic plan - very heterogeneous administrative provisions in the Member States .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , what effect do European Parliament debates on human rights actually have ?
It must also demand clarification as to what has become of the children that the Chinese troops took into custody , the present whereabouts and state of these children and refugees and the manner in which such situations on the border are , as a rule , handled .
In these discussions we will express our frustration with the Russian action in Chechnya .
These are priorities which , for Parliament , must now be translated into figures and calculations in euros and cents .
I will merely point out that the prospect of Turkish accession has been held out to the Turkish people for 42 years .
This is a political responsibility that we must shoulder .
The causes are simple : low Community cofinancing ( no more than 50 % ) , the complex nature and administrative costs of managing these programmes and the shorter list of products covered .
I feel a little uncomfortable here because I personally told this House that a proposal would soon be forthcoming .
The Albanian Parliament has set up a special committee on the restoration of property .
Since action was urgently required , and still is , I am delighted with it .
Mr President , Member States have differing traditions with regard to industrial relations , and we should respect this .
We would be appealing in fact for the fundamental freedom of religious expression in Saudi Arabia .
How can that be reconciled with the internal market ?
This should continue to be the case .
The act will give consumers more control when purchasing goods , protect them from unfair activities , extend consumer choice and increase competition .
As diplomatic means had no chance of success they had no option other than this to defend themselves .
As it stands , the policy on high protein crops in Europe works to the disadvantage of farmers and producers , who are forced to pay quotas for them which are dependent on turbulence in the global market .
It can therefore only be correctly assured if we maintain a reserved service .
This team was tasked with providing an independent monitoring of gas flow transiting through Ukraine to the EU and is deployed in both countries .
The discharge procedure should be simplified and streamlined for the decentralised agencies , which are growing in number ( from 8 in 2000 , to 20 in 2006 ) and represent a total budget of around EUR 1 billion .
Therefore , as I said before in my first speech , we need to use those resources by prioritising and redistributing allocations to make spending increasingly efficient and achieve our objectives in the most intelligent way .
A court made a decision on this case , but he was given information about the court appearance after the date .
Naturally , there is a very big difference between that and projecting baseless assessments and analyses .
And I should like to say to my German fellow MEPs that I understand their view .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , thank you for your reply .
We are therefore abstaining from the vote on this report .
This money is already reserved in the budget , but the Council has so far been reluctant to free up the resources .
Whilst Commissioner Fischler recognises that the Commission &apos; s conduct in the Fléchard affair is far from exemplary , Commissioner Schreyer refused to make a declaration that this kind of behaviour cannot be tolerated in future .
The real question is what it is used for and why it is necessary .
Oral explanations of vote
But at the same time we need a sense of common purpose .
It is therefore completely unacceptable that the Commission should not have put this important area in order .
Secondly , I would like to thank Mr Lehne for his report .
In spite of this , the Commission has stated that there is no limit to the degree to which criminal law might be brought within the competence of the Community and that , in principle , all the areas regulated by the EC Treaty might be subject to such transfers of authority .
We need to maintain the progress we have made in other areas .
If you are not , if you do not think I mean you , then I do not .
I am , therefore , in favour of making an exception and postponing the vote to give the Council a few more weeks - two or six - and then , in accordance with what Mr Staes has said , I will be in favour of an immediate vote , in June at the latest .
It incorporates within one document the relevant passages of the directives on this subject , so that the provisions are clearer and more practical for European citizens .
We also reject the amendments which aim to incorporate the integral cost of water for 2010 .
That is the real success of the European model : the fact that we are voluntarily becoming curious about our languages .
The victims of mass killings , military massacres and ethnic cleansing equally deserve to have their memories honoured , and for the wrongs committed against them to be remembered .
( NL ) The tragic accident in Buizingen obliges all of us - Europe included - to open an investigation .
As you know , we must rebuild public finances on sustainable foundations . This , of course , means responsible spending , but it also means generating revenue in a fair , efficient and sustainable way and , as you know , the tax systems which are currently in place in Europe do not meet these criteria .
I cannot read it .
I would actually have voted in favour if only English were to be used , since today it functions as a lingua franca .
Yes , there is financial support to go and learn the language of the exchange country , but there are no funds provided for an interpreter during the exchange , and that applies to sign language interpreters too .
Just as we learned to save water , we have to learn to respect energy and use it efficiently .
The immediate danger is that the Latin American currencies may weaken .
This means balancing things out , in my view .
In this regard , it must be made quite clear that , naturally , the risk at our borders may be even greater than the risk within the European Union ; i.e. , that there is the risk of counterfeit medicines being brought into the EU from outside .
I am convinced that Georgia is an example to Caucasian region countries , and I have no fear in saying that this country can serve as an example to some EU Member States that currently lack the political courage to carry out reforms that would pave the way to growth and modernisation .
This is linked to the complexity of these rules .
This , of course , can only serve to show that the Council cannot say &apos; yes &apos; to the Treaty of Lisbon while , at the same time , putting forward one or other project for financing and then saying : but you will not get any money for its implementation .
Each Community acquis is fiercely defended .
Community Environment Action Programme ( 2001 @-@ 2010 )
I am thankful that this House is prioritising activities of this kind , and I support accelerating the proposed programme so that implementation can get under way by January 2009 .
Besides , how can the aberrations in the Commission report be ignored ?
Primarily , it is the Belarusian nation that needs to be woken up and informed – by television , radio , on the Internet and by other means – of the fact that this is not the face of true democracy , of a state founded on the rule of law .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - Madam President , the Commission very much welcomes Parliament &apos;s own @-@ initiative report on the efficient and effective EU funding of decommissioning of nuclear power plants in the new Member States .
I should not like to be a party to that , and I am glad that many of those present in the House today have said the same thing .
And as long as these oligopolies are not dismantled , we need specific policies in sectoral renewables and so on .
If we really want to help the affected countries , we must support only financial projects that have a high degree of innovation and which consistently conserve the environment .
Thirdly , after the election in the form of a clear unwillingness to hand over power to those elected .
These and other planned measures aim to extend the scope for harmonisation of criminal law in the different EU Member States , strengthen the federalist nature of the European Union , and advance and draw strength from the &apos; Reform &apos; Treaty , which removes from states new areas of jurisdiction in legal and home affairs .
Local people argued that the pipeline should be laid out to sea .
However , the good intentions of the report outweigh the negatives and we have therefore chosen to vote in favour of it .
I hope that as many colleagues as possible , including in my own group , agree with me on this point .
As I have said , using a battering ram against the social security system would definitely be the worst thing that the European Union could do at this point .
Members pointed out some issues that needed to be clarified and will have to be monitored in order to reach our common aim : having a well @-@ functioning supervisory system that is capable of doing its job properly .
I think that it is good to address environmental aspects , for example .
Let us show that we are up to the challenge .
We think there is nothing to evaluate for our part .
In particular , I should like to thank representatives of the Belarussian opposition for their support of the Union of Poles in Belarus at this difficult time .
Europe picked up the baton in 1987 and 1988 .
The Committee on Institutional Affairs has therefore decided to focus on the elements that appear to give the necessary impetus to the Union &apos;s development .
As Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten has stated , work with the European Commission was also perfectly feasible .
We endorse your report , but we intend to reject the legislative resolution .
Since I am one of the candidates , my presence there will be required .
As far as we are concerned , this is how things will remain , because otherwise we run the risk of losing our way in a structure of soft criteria , and the European and Monetary Union cannot survive on soft criteria .
I also welcome the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice which , despite all the criticism it has rightly generated , has at least one virtue : it has increased the number of policies covered by the codecision procedure , thereby giving the European Parliament greater power to act .
The compromise which has been reached is balanced and marks an important advance for patients &apos; safety and health .
On the basis of our common values , we are strong , democratic and free .
Before starting oil extraction and making plans for the construction of pipelines in the Baltic Sea , we should consider the environmental issues .
Mr Whitehead asked me about research on vaccines .
Following a recommendation by the Committee on Legal Affairs , the President , if he agrees , submits his comments .
As the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs ’ rapporteur on the REACH programme , I can do no other than reiterate the demand made in the working paper : if there is to be comparability , we need rules made by the European Union , and , in the same way , rules laid down as standards by the WTO .
A programme of measures to promote biological diversity in the fishing industry was expected to be available from 28 March , that is to say last week .
Surely this , of all fields , is one that ought to be determined by national electorates through their own proper democratic mechanisms and procedures .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen . Mr Swoboda is making a mistake and I would ask you to consider it carefully .
Indeed , do you have a mobile phone or is your battery flat ?
This is a human rights issue and the European Union has certain possibilities open to it .
Health is too important to leave to researchers from the private sector alone .
It is partly , though , a result of the rush into biofuels : the EU proposal of a 10 % increase in fuel for transport ; in America , the 30 % of corn crops now going into ethanol , reducing the land available for food and pushing up the price of cornflour .
This project brings together citizens from the 27 EU Member States ahead of the European Parliament elections in order to discuss responses to the question , &apos; what can the European Union do to influence our economic and social future in a globalised world ? &apos;
However , it is not sufficient to guarantee a widespread use of encryption .
The texts of the draft agreements have been kept secret for too long .
. I voted as I did on the amendments before us because I share the concerns – and the aims – of this proposal for a directive aimed at bringing in sufficient harmonisation to develop the internal market , whilst complying with the rules on public health protection .
&apos;Whereas many protestors have been attacked or taken into custody by the security forces &apos; : that is our first amendment .
The EU must take action here .
Has he read the Duke of Edinburgh &apos;s criticism this week of the one @-@ sided nature of fishing agreements between the EU and poor developing countries ?
2006 is set to be a key year also in terms of meeting the goals of restoring dynamic and sustainable growth and providing for more and better jobs .
We must remember that 2004 is a special year , with a new Parliament , and the current Commission will shortly be replaced with a new one .
I believe a common European system will also be able to give consumers the guidance they need when making good and correct environmental choices and getting products manufactured in an environmentally friendly way .
It makes sense to invest resources in everyday structures that support people ’ s health , and not just in corrective work .
I believe there are a few points about these reports on which we have to come to a basic understanding .
Otherwise let me note that in the initial statements from Mr Brok , Mr Severin and Mr Watson , I found lots of wisdom that could guide our further deliberations as we move on with the important relationship that we seek with China , understanding the complexity of that relationship in all its dimensions .
The European Union has longstanding legislation protecting its waters , namely the 2000 Water Framework Directive , which establishes the objective of protecting all waters - rivers , lakes , ground @-@ waters and coastal waters - and which , in the case of shared hydrographic basins extending beyond administrative and political borders , provides for the coordination of efforts in order to achieve this objective .
In making an inventory of the EU resources still available to combat social dumping , the Sainjon report notes that such resources are scarce . What is more , the rapporteur can only propose optional and incentive measures .
Finally , Commissioner , you said that you recognised that healthcare has a special character .
That is why ASEAN was selected as a partner for one of our new @-@ generation FTAs in Global Europe .
What they would all agree is that we must make sure that we get value for the limited amount of money that we have to spend on culture .
Secondly , I would say also that this issue should be included as a target in the CAP reform , which is coming up shortly , so that we do have self @-@ sufficiency in protein production .
We must drop our original request for a separate Objective 4 for rural areas and separate consideration of the areas dependent on fisheries . However , we do need a horizontal , harmonised structural policy to safeguard the objectives of the common fisheries policy .
All executions , wherever they take place , should be condemned .
Mr President , I would just like to say that the rapporteur , Mr Skinner , is being very unsporting .
I believe that we need to support further cooperation between different EU research , technological development and innovation programmes , and feel that the continuity of the future programme , once established , is important for all actors involved .
Who will sit down at a table at this point and genuinely negotiate with the military leaders ?
Fortunately for the European Parliament , which should have strongly denounced the attitude of the Michelin management which has just announced a massive series of cuts in workforce and redundancies , even though the returns and profits for this firm increased substantially .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , several people have already pointed out the value of Mr Rocard &apos;s report regarding the Commission communication on guidelines for negotiating a new cooperation agreement with Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific .
Because unfortunately , hatred , coercion and attempts to put the partner under pressure using these methods , have regained the upper hand .
As always happens with new phenomena which must be considered and assessed , there is of course a procedure to be followed .
Mr President , with respect to my colleague , it is actually not satisfactory because as he knows - and if he spent as much time in the Human Rights Subcommittee as I do , he would - it is in committees that we actually get a chance to have more than one say and more than one minute , and then we actually get a direct response .
( HU ) Thank you , Madam President .
in writing . - I voted against the provision of external aid to South Sudan of EUR 200 million in development cooperation in order to assist South Sudan to cope with the numerous humanitarian and socio @-@ economic challenges in a context of reduced governance capacity and political fragility .
We must also look at the whole legislative process implied by what is being called for in this report .
It is precisely this cautious assessment process that has guaranteed the internal stability of the euro in recent years while at the same time enhancing its external stability .
Other areas that I have been following with concern , such as the trafficking in human beings and human organs , were also addressed appropriately in this resolution , and that is something new and positive .
The legal formulation of the Member States &apos; criminal justice provisions and criminal law should under no circumstances be a matter for the Union .
For a hazard not to turn into a catastrophe , the key is in monitoring , preparedness and prevention , and I could not agree more with those speakers who have hammered on this point .
I must confess that we have had our share of failures .
She knows how much I esteem her , but in this instance I disagree with her .
As the resolution states , Zimbabwe very much needs a mediation process which includes various parties from the international community and Africa .
On this basis , we hope that this last obstacle can soon be cleared .
Not enough publicity is being given to this foul trade .
The Johannesburg text also calls for the successful completion of the Doha Agenda , placing the needs of developing countries at the heart of negotiations , but without interfering with its negotiations on subsidies and tariffs .
It is worth emphasising that the same public prosecutor ’ s office refused to institute proceedings following the insulting references to homosexuals contained in an article in the publication , in which it was stated that ‘ homosexuality is a disease and a threat to the family .
In Poland this figure currently stands at EUR 100 , although our dream is to achieve EUR 250 .
For Castro , the dictator pathetically romanticised by many in Europe , these people are , however , a grave threat .
We also had the satisfaction of seeing our original cooperation with the Commission finally take on a trilateral dimension , as the governments of 11 Member States signed agreements with us and shared in the joint effort .
The Council is aware of the importance of the role of young farmers , particularly in the development of the rural environment and environmental conservation .
Not in eight and a half years have I come across such a poor proposal for a directive put to this House , so you can be grateful that Parliament eventually had the opportunity to improve certain aspects of this feeble effort .
My anxieties increase when I recall some of the statements made to me over the years when I worked on the European satellite navigation project .
At the end of the day , this is also about how we guard the steel industry against the threat of the international hedge funds , with their speculation in steel , coke and coal meaning that responsible management is now no longer possible . This is where the Lisbon process imposes on us the responsibility of focussing on Europe ’ s lawmaking and of standing up for our industrial firms in order to safeguard the jobs they provide .
The opportunity for students to have families is also very significant from an equality perspective .
New technologies are opening up new markets , alternatives to the traditional postal service , such as fax and E @-@ mail .
I would like to again express our dismay and our grief over the victims and express our sympathy to their families .
The active role of local and regional authorities is crucial for ensuring greater economic competitiveness within the global market .
Reform is all the more necessary in light of the increasing number of relatively new factors of social concern such as the unsustainable nature of pension systems , long @-@ term unemployment , unemployment among the young and unemployment among those with qualifications .
They are telling them that everything is under control , we just need to make small changes to the treaty by introducing a permanent stability mechanism and then the problem will be resolved .
Innocent people should not have to suffer the consequences of the criminal behaviour of others .
Moreover , the Commission was not courageous enough , Mr Barroso .
The report incorporates measures aimed at improving food safety as well as animal health .
New forms of terrorism are emerging as a result of the on @-@ going and rapid development of information technologies , electronic databases and computer equipment .
These are the international civilian mission ( ICM ) , a rule of law mission and programmes for continuing the promotion of economic development and furthering Kosovo &apos;s prospects of EU membership .
It is a progressive disease , which means that over time , more parts of the brain will become damaged and , as this occurs , the symptoms become worse .
If they did not do so , the Commission , in the first place , and ultimately the European Court of Justice would have to take measures against the state or states that did not comply with the legislation .
Consequently , another &apos; No &apos; vote from the Irish people cannot be ruled out .
– Mr President , better lawmaking is one of the Commission ’ s priorities , and this initiative has been welcomed by both the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and this House as a whole .
I say this because I believe that the market has enough burdens as it is - such as the new capital requirements , and the new deposit guarantee schemes - and we have not yet even begun to feel their effect .
This cannot represent the intention of the initiator .
We therefore have the duty to look for the best ways to apply this measure and , in this case , we must structure it with a view to responsibility and enforce it in a responsible way with regard to all those operators who are adapting their production process .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , many of us at last are beginning to realise that our planet is not indestructible and that it indeed has an expiry date which we humans , through our not so wise actions , are bringing drastically closer .
There are at present 25 different systems of vehicle taxation in the EU , and putting them on a uniform footing will help the internal market work better ; that much we know , and to those Members who would deny it , one has to say that it simply has to be admitted that the effect of this proposal is to do away with the distortions and inefficiency that result from double taxation when vehicles are transported across borders .
In several countries , the regime is trying to prevent and limit citizens &apos; access to the Internet by censoring and closing websites .
This is what we should also be aiming for in the case of tyres .
They are obviously a vital part of the transport chain , especially for those who have access to cars .
There is one thing I should like to thank the absent Mr Barroso for , namely that he was in favour of a larger budget for the European Union .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( HU ) Thank you .
For that reason , I think that Amendment No 9 is very important , as it specifies that a reply has to be given within at most nine months .
People today have the good fortune to be able , at long last , to live to an age that has in fact always been genetically possible .
Today also happens to be your birthday Mr Yushchenko , and on behalf of the House I would like to wish you many happy returns of the day .
We do not believe that a lucrative , generous early retirement scheme of this kind can be justified to the European taxpayer .
We should not underestimate those health risks , which include stomach and abdominal disorders , skin , eye and respiratory tract complaints and outer ear infections .
It is up to Sweden to initiate the phase which President Prodi calls &apos; open reflection &apos; .
According to the new constitution , amendments to the tax system , the pension system and family support system must be adopted by a two @-@ thirds majority .
If we only talk about consumer rights in this context , then we should not forget to mention that rights also involve duties .
When it comes to Europe 2020 - the climate - if we are to take this as the proof of success or failure , what is Connie Hedegaard actually supposed to take to Bonn in May ?
First of all , you wished to bring forward your vote to today or yesterday .
It is therefore important that the Commission and others be given the opportunity to take forward that process of rigorous assessment , but I am cognisant of the strength of feeling , both within certain Member States and among representatives here in this Parliament .
Are these people , as discredited as they are , going to be able to restore the confidence that we need ?
Mr President , I always try to speak in my own language , but sometimes I feel that I should not on such sensitive issues .
We know about the problems that we are currently facing , the oil problem that is not affecting us in a positive way , and we therefore have to consider how we are going to tackle this very important issue .
.
The euro is a stability currency even in the eyes of the world .
First of all , I do not consider the fact that Members of this Parliament should talk to one another as a crime and secondly , the Conference of Presidents has respected the proposal tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Security and Defence Policy .
More than reports , European industries and entrepreneurs need clear political will .
The Member States of the Union are wrongly keeping very quiet .
You said that the people of Europe wanted growth and jobs .
I have been very grateful for that cooperation with both the Council and the Commission and , of course , for the very supportive cooperation of colleagues within the committee .
Your new framework directive , Commissioner , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , must be about empowering the victims . It must give them rights and a new future .
I would therefore welcome , alongside references to the importance of the environment , clear and concrete environmental objectives to be included in the economic policy guidelines .
Are we prepared to take specific action against speculative , shortterm capital movements and to create a framework of global rules governing such movements ?
The information we are receiving about this makes us very sceptical .
It can , nevertheless , in the affected fish , lead to severe weight loss and early death in its advanced stages and it therefore has had a serious economic impact on the whole Scottish aquaculture sector costing the industry around EUR 60 to 70 million in losses arising from the mandatory premature culling and other eradication measures .
Our priority now is excellence in legislation .
We proposed extending the transitional period , which would reduce the costs significantly .
Mr President , I would like to welcome and commend all those who have spoken on this subject this morning .
Additionally , a strategic dialogue on Asia has begun .
Hundreds of thousands of coal and steel workers benefited from adjustment aids to cope with structural change .
Some people have indicated that there is not enough focus on energy efficiency .
In turn , the response to this has always been to develop new antibiotics , and the wheel turns faster and faster .
It is too bad for the work of the European Parliament &apos;s Committee on Foreign Affairs when all day long , elements are praised even though they are often less commendable than the ideas that the Assembly in Paris has so far come up with .
I will end with this : if there is a problem , the problem lies with the lack of harmonisation of the national legislation on elections .
It is the tenderer with the financially most advantageous offer to whom the contract must be awarded .
Would he also agree with me that there is a lack of choice of financial intermediaries within the United Kingdom to access venture capital , particularly for small and medium @-@ sized companies ?
Its exports in this sector represent 20 % of its total exports .
I hope that we will use that opportunity for a plan that is supported by major economic and environmental groups .
On 12 January 1999 , I wrote to the European banking associations requesting the necessary information to compare the level of fees before and after the introduction of the euro .
The result of the conciliation procedure can quite reasonably be considered a success for the European Parliament , since some of our main requests were incorporated , namely in terms of its scope , fundamental rights for passengers irrespective of distance , derogations and , lastly , providing for accidents , cancellations and delays with suitable forms of reimbursement , assistance and compensation for passengers .
We must not forget !
Predictably , the main themes , ranging from enlargement to the CIG , via the Charter of Fundamental Rights , were largely put off for the Nice Summit .
That is a very bad idea .
Let us not run the risk of implementing it with badly informed citizens , when they are not deliberately disinformed .
Question Time ( Commission )
Those , then , are the main points I wished to highlight on behalf of my Group .
2 .
In particular , deficits in Portugal and Germany have risen to levels approaching the 3 % of GDP reference value which prompted the Commission to activate the early @-@ warning mechanism .
. – I voted for the Sommer report as I believe inland waterway navigation is a key factor in transport intermodality .
Secondly , the principle of additionality is one of the main pillars of our structural policy , and I do not want to undermine it .
There must be better coordination between fishermen and naval personnel to ensure that such accidents can be avoided .
Also , reducing the speed limit will allow us to fight the greenhouse effect .
I am particularly grateful to the Council , also , and I am pleased that Mr Deldrup will be speaking as well , which I think is an indication of the importance that the Council attaches to this important file .
Therefore , we should also be careful about increasing pledges on reduction from 20 % to 30 % , since other industrialised countries are not showing the will to set themselves such ambitious goals , while financial support for developing countries should also be a realistic undertaking .
We foresee the EU combating social exclusion and discrimination , promoting equality between women and men - which is a crucial point in our documents - and protecting the rights of children .
Their emancipation and protection are the sine qua non in putting a stop to the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war .
An apple with wormholes in it can be far healthier than a shiny , beautifully round apple .
The next item is the report by Klaus @-@ Heiner Lehne , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs , on the annual accounts of certain types of companies as regards micro @-@ entities - C6 @-@ 0074 / 2009 - .
Using information provided by infrastructure managers , each Member State would define the rush hour period for the individual country , bearing in mind regional and long @-@ distance freight traffic .
Over and above the steps we are able to take - and will take should it prove necessary to do so - we are currently engaged in taking very decisive action to create equal and fair competitive condition for the European air industry .
Moreover , the Commission has observer status .
The trust has , however , suddenly turned to deep concern .
The money markets will supposedly punish Europe for its governments &apos; lack of budgetary discipline by depressing the value of the euro .
This constructive approach taken by the two institutions should enable us to adopt the regulation quickly and to launch an initial call for tenders under Marco Polo II .
His superior – who happened to be the Minister of the Interior – carried out the punishment within Slovak law and according to ministers ’ rights and obligations to act in order to prevent the destabilisation of the country .
So the future of transatlantic relations is a matter of real concern to all of us and it was of course entirely appropriate that the Foreign Minister referred so eloquently to that issue during his remarks .
Announcement by the President
Let us hope now that this practice can be discontinued completely , across the EU and in the accession countries .
Within the framework of current legislation , timid efforts are naturally being made to encourage the local film industry and a new , more specific law on films is being considered .
I am delighted to see the broad support in the House across the political groups for this .
The next item is the election of the Vice @-@ Presidents of the European Parliament .
I can assure him that , in close coordination with the national administrations and representative organizations , the Commission will endeavour to facilitate the adaptation of the public and private sectors in each Member State .
I am very pleased about this and would like to thank the Council representatives , the Czech Presidency and Commissioner Piebalgs for their very close and fruitful cooperation .
The attention being paid to the depressing situation on Israel &apos;s northern border in the present resolution of this Parliament deals with the cause and effects and ignores the political reality in situ .
I voted for the report because I agree with its proposals . Of these , I should like to stress the need for new and diversified lifelong learning , which is crucial for better @-@ quality work , particularly in the context of jobs , as well as the need to pay particular attention to young people , to women and to the disabled , as set out in the Europe 2020 strategy .
Do you have a view on this , bearing in mind also that the Environment Agency and other national agencies welcome these proposals very much ?
To be able to assess the success of such actions , it is important not only to carry out an audit of the quota of funds allocated by the European Union , but also of course to have access to all available data associated with the project , particularly in respect of the contributions made by the individual Member States .
Within the framework of accession partnerships the strengthening of administrative structures for coordinating social security in the States of Romania , the Czech Republic , Hungary , Poland , Cyprus , Slovakia , Malta , Bulgaria , Latvia , Lithuania and Slovenia has been given medium @-@ term priority .
The people need encouragement .
I think your message is loud and clear , Mrs Maes , and we will ensure that it is understood .
It is not said very often , but it is true that since the beginning of this decade , despite low growth , in the euro zone and of course also in the whole of the European Union , significantly more jobs have been created than in the United States , which always establish themselves as the reference point to be imitated in policies and strategies for job creation .
Then too we are told that , without book price fixing , a lot of smaller bookshops will go under .
The four measures are all innovative and I should say that we should not confine the debate only to the financial transaction tax .
We tend to forget Moldova , even though it is enormously important to our security .
Everyone should be aware that the situation will become very serious and therefore it is worthwhile considering whether we in this Parliament can improve the situation of European companies , for example , by quickly considering and adopting proposals from the Commission which aim to prevent European companies from having to pay unnecessary costs .
Finally , let me also say , on the issue of Kosovo , mentioned by many in this House , that the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed by a number of Members on the situation in Kosovo , and the European Union has done everything possible to reach a negotiated solution , but it is clear now that the status quo is unsustainable and that the UN Security Council will have to address this when it looks at it on 19 December .
We therefore oppose their progressive transfer to the supranational institutions of the EU in a process that justifies every new &apos; advance &apos; on the basis of the previous &apos; advance &apos; .
First , Colombia .
In that respect , not only do I not consider the procedure right but I do not consider the substance entirely convincing either .
This work is being led by the Commissioner in charge of energy , Mr Piebalgs , and the Commission will report to Parliament and to the Council at the turn of the year .
Free price setting in the food sector has led in recent years to excellent results in the form of relatively lower food prices throughout the EU .
There are some naked images I enjoy looking at , but I do not enjoy the visual image of lorry @-@ loads of naked , unstamped eggs leaving foreign battery cage units en route to the UK in 2012 .
It is important that the decision to start these negotiations should not be unduly or unreasonably postponed .
We abstained from voting on all of the paragraphs partly because we consider that the EU &apos;s entire agricultural policy is ineffective and wasteful and partly because we do not wish to contribute to the introduction of a new form of support , the financing of which is moreover uncertain .
I would like to underline that by adopting a common strategy for the whole of Europe on Roma inclusion , we in the European Parliament are demonstrating that the European Union is not just leaving Roma integration problems to be addressed by the Member States themselves .
I found it remarkable that , a fortnight ago , when , at my request , the Russian Foreign Minister , Mr Lawrow , visited the Committee on Foreign Affairs , he proposed that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Russia be extended next year and deeper institutional links be established between the Russian and EU institutions .
This is enough to show that the initiative is both necessary and urgent .
Thank you for your excellent address , Mr Gabriel .
So , what can we do ?
Finally , let me reiterate my thanks to all my fellow Members for their great goodwill and cooperation over the past few months .
Unemployment is increasing in most countries .
Mr Makhkamboy Azimovich Makhmudov , who is leading the delegation , is accompanied by Mr Nosir Yusupovich Salimov and Mr Gulkhoja Gangibekov .
We are not talking here of the death penalty as such , which remains legal in international law and is still practised in a number of democracies , not only the United States , but also Russia , India , Caribbean islands , Japan and Singapore to name but a few .
We have to do everything possible to guard this common area comprehensively so that illegal migrants , who aggravate the security situation in the Member States , cannot get in .
I would like to thank Mrs Barsi @-@ Pataky for the excellent cooperation on this report .
He fought for social justice and his experience during the war made him an ardent supporter of peace .
This makes it all the more regrettable that the majority of Members of the European Parliament will not endorse the rapporteur &apos;s views and that they , and especially the large political groups , are allowing themselves to be misled by the industry .
We call on the House to reject this amendment .
I welcome the cooperation on nuclear safety with reservations regarding nuclear proliferation and nuclear transports and plutonium stockpiling already outlined .
With regard to amendments which the Commission cannot accept , I would like to say that , firstly , there is the one which refers to increasing the ambitions of this programme , that is , achieving a saving of 1.5 % .
I want to see Zagreb take action .
Sometimes , we complain that not much can be done , but in this case , we can take specific measures , and this has already been mentioned , today .
And all of you , ladies and gentlemen , who perhaps have a dog at home , and who think about what else you can do to make its life better , should just try to imagine how you would feel if it was your dog that somebody was going to test a cosmetic product on .
However , better engagement and cooperation with Belarus in areas of common interest is essential to encourage reform in that country .
We also have a programme which is not being adhered to .
In other words , there must be no cutbacks in education , no tuition fees , no depriving universities of resources , and no reduction in teaching hours , particularly in the natural sciences , for it is they that foster creativity and are therefore necessary both for the development of the individual , whether personal or professional .
If we have to have simple rules , if we want to have more efficient , cost @-@ effective systems to manage them through the Member States and within the Commission , that is the moment to address those issues .
But once the crisis has passed , apply the precautionary principle and tackle the causes rather than the consequences .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal for a regulation on investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Community is an important instrument for promoting an EU @-@ level energy policy effectively .
Therefore , when I read this title , &apos; Civil dialogue under the Treaty of Lisbon &apos; , I thought , &apos; that would be a good idea , would it not ? &apos;
Further mobilisation of the private sector is also vitally import and must be exploited even more .
We know that in some countries , such as Uzbekistan , the situation is very fragile and problematic .
I think China is on the right path because , for better or for worse , it is one of the lucky countries , a lucky nation with a long history of culture and civilisation and the heritage to match .
The traditional mechanisms of the European model have not , however , allowed the desired aims of cooperation to be achieved with complete success .
The costs of unemployment are a heavy drain on national economies .
Well now , Mr Andersson seems to think that the health situation will improve if we restrict the import of alcohol .
So what can we say ?
This danger is made greater by economic and monetary union .
In 2006 , the European Commission presented its proposal for changing the existing Community civil protection mechanism .
However , I am at the same time concerned that the work has led to the request for a long list of legislative initiatives on the part of the Commission , relating for example to lifelong learning , organisation of work , the need to reconcile work and private life , working environment policy , supplementary sickness insurance and the hiring @-@ out of staff .
The EU is also involved in a range of problems of regional significance such as relations between India and Pakistan , the situation in the Korean Peninsula and developments in Burma .
Social policy and everything that can be subsumed under the heading &apos; social security &apos; is an outstanding example of a domain of the Member States , and sometimes of their federal states - not of the European Union .
Is there any reason why the Council has not deigned to attend this extremely important debate this afternoon ?
I extend to you the warmest congratulations on this splendid report and wish you , personally , all the best .
We are here to do a job and it should be recorded both for the archives and for television just like any other session .
One of the objectives of the Regulation governing on the spot controls is to ensure that there is a standardised level of protection for the Community budget in all Member States .
( ES ) Mr President , I believe the Portuguese Presidency is devoting a fair amount of attention to this matter , I believe the reply was accurate .
This directive at last provides for waste collection from ships as they berth in ports , and this is a positive step .
The threats posed by the unamended directive are as follows .
Mr President , the recent heavy rainfall in the area of Bulgaria and northern Greece caused the River Evros to burst its banks .
That must not be allowed to become a mere rhetorical phrase , but must be a living concept , and one backed up by verifiable criteria .
This is being introduced at a time when businesses are currently in the situation where they pay VAT on an invoice as soon as it is issued , but the relevant invoice payment ( and associated VAT ) may only be paid months later , if ever .
The four major EU arms suppliers have dramatically increased their share of arms sales to the developing world in the last year .
In terms of the question from Mrs Pleštinská , I believe that some marginalisation does exist .
In the light of the ever more extensive range of products offered for sale , Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten &apos;s report goes in the right direction , which is toward educating Europeans in the practice of comparative consumerism .
In fact we need to ask ourselves every now and again if the European Parliament is really in a position to wave its finger at every country in the world and lecture them about democracy and constitutionality .
– Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , only in early October , the Romanian Prime Minister , Mr Popescu , stated that the enormous increase in organised crime in Bulgaria is at risk of jeopardising the accession of both countries in 2007 and that the safeguard clause will have to be applied to defer their accession until 1 January 2008 .
In total , it cost almost EUR 1 billion .
The Commission is well aware of these realities , as our proposals will show .
This amendment will therefore be accepted , with a slight change in order to balance the analysis of the impact that a rejection of the increase would have had .
The message we want to send today , therefore , is that we wish to make our point of view known through this debate on asylum procedures .
The future looks even more bleak .
We need to remind ourselves of what we want to achieve .
It would therefore be good and seemly if governments were to show due respect to parliaments and to the authors of the draft constitution by ensuring that their deliberations are not governed entirely by one single motive .
Subsequently , a joint European coastguard service could be set up , provided that it is subject to strict controls on its efficiency .
I am still hopeful , but previous experience has made me pessimistic .
Secondly , it is important that investors have confidence in the market .
This will take on even greater importance in the context of the new financial perspective 2007 @-@ 2013 , assuming it is adopted soon by Parliament , as I hope it will be .
My question , Commissioner , is not difficult , but I understand the difficulty which you have in giving a specific reply .
To some extent the country experiences stability under Debry but unfortunately , Madam President , the country still ranks fifth on the list of the poorest countries ; it is understandable that such a country intends to exploit its resources .
Let us make sure that this cooperation continues in the future .
We cannot allow the Community &apos;s method to be one of postponement ; it has to be a decisive method .
Our version of social partnership is in many ways ahead of the social dialogue .
I am sorry that I am having the last word on this document , which has been dealt with so admirably by Mr Crowley in his explanation of vote , but I have to say , Mr President , that I am deeply saddened - although I did vote for the document - by the fact that , in Italy , my beautiful country which has so much beautiful sun , there is , regrettably , still today , a law according to which those who become severely disabled and unfit for work , despite having worked and paid social security contributions , are to have an allowance of no more than EUR40 @-@ 50 per month on which to live between the age of 30 , say , and the age of 65 or maybe 70 .
Are we really being serious as regards the need to foster the European research policy ?
Making a Macedonian domestic political crisis out of it at this point in time does not help Macedonia .
I pay tribute to all my colleagues on the Committee on Fisheries for presenting a set of very realistic proposals .
But I , unlike him , am aware that I speak today for the Presidency of the European Union rather than simply rehearsing domestic political disputes between our parties .
A further puzzling aspect of the Committee &apos;s work was the decision to make documents containing damaging allegations available to the public before the individuals in question even had an opportunity to address the Committee .
This is why I am suggesting to the Commission to propose as its objective to inspect the quality of the national institutions entrusted with enforcing EU regulations on the storage of potentially hazardous industrial waste .
Great Britain , Germany and Spain have done this , and incidentally , all three were pressured by social democrats and socialists , and the other Member States have not .
As the report makes clear , the key objective of Youth on the Move is to help young people in Europe to gain the skills and experience they need to succeed in today &apos;s increasingly internationalised knowledge @-@ based economy .
1 .
What the Commissioner also emphasised is that it is important to find a way to build a bridge between those countries that mainly earn their money from trade and those which have to get most of it from production .
They have to take decisions on issues which are more complicated than ever .
Specifically when it comes to everything to do with foreign affairs and defence , we try to show that the EU still consists of 15 sovereign states .
The behaviour of the United States , not just on this issue but also - and far more seriously in some ways - on the issue of Iraq , is becoming increasingly difficult to understand .
We have had many debates in this Chamber on the problems of the past , and I believe that today we should see if we in the European Union are able to contribute to resolving this major issue ( because it will also have an impact on the Annapolis Conference and the peace process ) .
The eventful journey of this report through the competent committees , leading to its approval , is a testimony to this interest .
Nonetheless , the immense wealth in terms of the linguistic and cultural diversity of Europe is , at the same time , the cause of the greatest structural problem on the audiovisual markets in Europe .
We must acknowledge that Mr Crowley &apos;s report responds to a clear wish for legal clarification of the texts , of our Assembly &apos;s Rules of Procedure on the one hand , and the Statute of the European Ombudsman on the other .
And another thing : Turkey must take immediate steps to renounce war , to accept the process of the International Court at The Hague and to accept that it must stop the war against its own citizens .
( DE ) Mr President , it has become clear that the focus of this whole issue is on the passengers .
The treaties must be simplified .
- fifthly , with this approach and current rates , the WTO estimates that China will have 3 / 5 of exports in 2015 , a position which it held for a thousand years , from 500 to 1500 A.D.
My group has debated this matter and considers that , given the current situation of the whole process of market integration and deregulation in such a sensitive area , it is appropriate that Parliament makes an initial statement , regardless of any action it may take in the future , so that Commissioner Bolkestein may take good note and in order to guide next week &apos; s debate .
I also know that this House is already working hard on its opinion .
The Council stated that the lifting of the visa restrictions would be reviewed after six months , to assess whether Uzbekistan had made progress in meeting these conditions .
Only together will we be able to resolve the problem of illegal immigration and win the war on organised crime .
On the basis of my report , the European Council requested the presidency to continue its consultations .
Consequently , the provisions laid down in Directive 2007 / 46 / EC relating to systems , components and separate technical units for vehicles apply to this directive .
Therefore , an important political lesson that the European Union should draw from the Tagliavini report is that it should actively assist Kiev in the defence of its national independence against any of its neighbours .
I do not think that it is appropriate to state my concerns publicly on such an important matter .
Our recast of the Council Decision establishing the Community mechanism for civil protection is the legal embodiment of a number of proposals put forward in these reports .
There are , however , other items into which the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has not been incorporated and which must be re @-@ stated .
What if Europe is first in production , consumption and exports in the world thanks to the good quality wines that it produces ?
Parliament and the Council have been guaranteed greater powers without , however , endangering the EIT &apos;s autonomy .
Finally , in relation to comments made by Commissioner Patten and by the High Representative Mr Solana in relation to the visiting Iranian delegation , I too am very pleased that this delegation is here this week , and I am very glad about the comments that have been made here today by both Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten .
Furthermore , deliberations in the Council of Ministers are continuing , and why should we not have an in @-@ depth debate on this issue , given that we will not , after all , be making any decision ? That is the point I would like everyone opposing this question to consider .
As a Member of this Parliament , I believe that we must hope that foreign policy becomes a constant and common theme of all the political forces in the next European elections .
A reduction in assistance would increase the risk of failure in terms of the desired aims of state aid in the new Member States , as it is often the case that these states simply do not have any funding of their own for these purposes .
In view of the fraught situation in the labour market and competition from cheap but poorly trained workforces , Europe &apos;s best chance lies in a high level of education and training .
The only question is what form it should take so that it is appropriate for both sides .
This is a very positive report . It promotes the two @-@ phase introduction of stricter mandatory emission standards by the years 2000 @-@ 2005 .
That was not over @-@ cautious protection , but fair compensation in the face of social dumping .
On external actions , I noted that the Commissioner mentioned Iraq but did not mention Afghanistan .
I think that Parliament - and the entire procedure , of course - will benefit from this proposed streamlining of procedures , especially from more transparent information , with the main elements of the application of financial policies and employment policies being provided in a coordinated manner .
Secondly , the adequate funding of rural development and the accompanying measures .
I would appeal to the Members to bear this in mind when they are voting tomorrow in relation to this question of increasing the budget .
The framework agreement is a mess . It can be used to withhold documents and to keep them confidential , for it is the Commission which , in the last analysis , decides whether a document is confidential .
Any review of farm prices or the CAP must take into account not only the economic viability of agriculture as a food producer but also the environmental and social significance of retaining the maximum number of farming families .
However , it will not impede progress towards an ever stronger European Union .
Mrs Ashton , you can be sure of the full support that our Parliament will give you in order to reject this type of behaviour .
I heard Commissioner Barnier say that he is intending to leave , that he needs to go early because he has other commitments .
This legislation is primarily concerned with mutual assistance in enforcing consumers ’ rights , for which every Member State is to set up a public office to function as the point of contact for the authorities in other Member States , although I wish to stress that no Member State will be obliged to set up a new authority .
And this is why we must insist they be held accountable .
in writing . The Constitutional Treaty is a landmark document which provides a blueprint for a more dynamic and effective European Union , strengthens the democratic character of an enlarged Union and enhances our decision @-@ making capacity and ability to act on the world stage .
Either we must succeed in making the euro a political project of which people can say , this is a good thing , this is valuable , this is worth going for , or we shall have nationalist reactions .
The debate is closed .
Development aid has been mentioned , and that is all well and good .
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs accepted the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and , despite my recommendation , rejected the Commission proposal ; in other words , it did not agree to exempt self @-@ employed drivers from the scope of the directive .
This would mean that each citizen would be able to petition their right to free residence and movement in front of any national judge in the Union .
Which strategy , then , do we want to adopt ?
As the main importer of coffee , the European Union bears the main responsibility in resolving this crisis .
The Commission should rethink what it has said and Parliament should support the Court of Auditors in its critical activities .
I can show you this black list .
Let us preserve the specificity of the small quality European olive grower .
Out of respect for the right of Member States ’ governments to appoint the Commission , I intended to vote in favour of the Commission initially presented by Mr Barroso .
B5 @-@ 0774 / 2001 by Sjöstedt , Marset Campos and Di Lello Finuoli , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group ,
Are you aware , for example , that in Belgium - just to take my own country as an example - the Minister for Employment and Labour cites a figure of around 500 000 unemployed people for the entire country , which is gross misinformation , as the Minister only takes into account those who are fully unemployed , who are on benefit and seeking employment ?
The Council absolutely agrees that only a political solution can resolve the Chechen conflict .
That is why the Côte d &apos;Ivoire Government and , above all , President Gbagbo , must ensure that people ’ s rights and freedoms are protected and bring the hostilities to an end without delay . Otherwise , we could be led to request the suspension of aid to Côte d &apos;Ivoire , aid that , as we are well aware , is indispensable to the people of Côte d &apos;Ivoire .
The communiqué , which does not contain a single word of remorse , which does not contain any request for forgiveness , which does not contain the least demonstration of submission to the rule of law , does nothing more than demonstrate the cynicism and moral meanness of this criminal group once again .
You made another point : why do we do this – to put a price on CO2 or in order to have investments in efficient technology ?
This proposal too will leave it entirely up to the individual Member States to decide to what extent they wish to tax motoring .
Mr Wynn , I can give you a definite answer to your first question as to whether the Commission is proposing across @-@ the @-@ board cuts in the external action heading : no , it does not propose to do so .
The Commission itself will guarantee an adequate presence on the ground and it hopes to play a prominent and visible role in the reconstruction work .
Quite a few of us voted for making the EU more open .
I believe the Commission has lost control of the Common Fisheries Policy and is simply becoming the poodle of the Spanish Government and the industry in Spain .
I support Mr Watts &apos; report and , in particular , the amendments which are aimed at extending the strengthened security measures for passenger boats to encompass &quot; underwater &apos; rail travel via tunnel .
The adoption of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum was a huge step in this direction , resulting in an immigration policy that is more coherent , controlled and linked to the needs of the labour market in European countries , and also to the resources available in terms of housing , health and education .
The next item is the Commission communication on a comprehensive monitoring report and strategy paper of the Commission on the progress towards accession by the candidate countries .
If your report is cool on modulation , I would describe it as extremely chilly on reductions of payments to large farms - you call that &apos; degressivity &apos; .
I would like here to outline the main points of the discussion and the very first conclusions .
Let me conclude by saying that I also hope we will not confine ourselves to imposing constraints while rejecting all the solutions .
You have been mentioned , but I do not believe that ...
But this is an agreement which is also negotiated with the Senegalese government .
Cunha report ( A4 @-@ 0219 / 98 )
This agreement stresses that the efforts of all developed countries to reduce emissions must be comparable with each other .
The Commission must assume a clear position in the World Trade Organisation and carry out specific impact assessments , negotiating with other parties as regards the importation of certain products to the EU market .
We have the legal basis in place and the question of how far we go with the existing legal basis will always be a political one .
It will have its shortcomings ; there will be untidiness and incoherence ; there will be lengthy transitional arrangements ; and there will be no thorough agricultural reform and no complete structural reform .
Marketing and advertising are an important part of communications , and if manufacturers &apos; products are to compete on the market , advertising must obviously use means that catch people &apos;s attention .
There is a reference to the phantasmagorical Mandelkern report in paragraph 19 and we are asked , in paragraph 35 , to approve eight directives in one fell swoop on the liberalisation of financial services .
Given that it is currently impossible to find a compromise solution with the Member States and to take account of certain criticism made of the original proposal , the Commission undertakes to forward to Parliament and the Council , as soon as possible , a new proposal for a directive amending Directive 79 / 112 / EEC regulating the labelling of ingredients of alcoholic beverages .
We must hope that the Council also heard what you had to say .
I do not think so ! I therefore voted against the motion .
In the final analysis , irrespective of all the transparency achieved , it all comes down to the moral compass of each Member of this House , as this dictates what he thinks is right , whom he meets and whom he decides not to meet , whom he listens to and whom he decides not to listen to .
We have Structural Funds , we have the European Social Fund and other funds that operate and that are perfectly equipped to respond to the challenges and the consequences of restructuring , which is linked to relocation , which itself is arguably linked to globalisation .
It was a very difficult task , but he did nevertheless succeed in it , so warm congratulations are due to him .
For Greece in particular , the directive intervenes indirectly and creates in order to bring to a close outstanding education issues on which there is acute confrontation and controversy on the part of the interested parties .
This cannot be tolerated in Europe today , just as we cannot tolerate democratic principles , freedom to differ and freedom of speech to be undermined as they were today by Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit and Mr Watson , who , referring to differences of opinion over the Charter of Fundamental Rights - or rather , not so much the Charter as the EU Reform Treaty - called the Members who were opposing him idiots .
On the structural funds , the ECU 100 million that we have all now agreed for the Irish peace process is an excellent example of how the three institutions have worked together to ensure that this has been achieved without a legal base .
National rules are also jeopardised by commercial enterprises that also deal in books and unceasingly cause these national systems to be attacked by national and European courts of law in the hope that they will one day actually collapse .
Let us abolish the EU &apos;s common agricultural policy and protectionist trade policy and let us stop protecting non @-@ competitive European production .
I have to dissociate myself from the idea of drawing up common EU proposals to eliminate unemployment .
Many delegations in Council are of the opinion that suspending Dublin transfers to Member States that are subject to practical pressures would create a poor precedent and would undermine the Dublin Regulation .
Similarly , the Trade and Cooperation Agreement , the promotion of cooperation between small and medium @-@ sized enterprises in Iran and those in the European Union , is a means of strengthening democracy .
They include , to name but a few , increasing the proportion of girls attending school and increasing the number of ante @-@ natal check @-@ ups .
– Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as we discuss the prospects for Iraq , we see before us the images coming out of that country .
In fact , the opposite is the case . I believe I read with sufficient speed and talk quickly enough for no one to accuse me of such things .
The second point concerns the emphasis in the resolution on the operational programmes of producer organisations .
On 12 January this year , the Commission adopted the communication on the annual growth survey .
This demonstrates that Parliament as a whole favours the development of European cinema and television , and personally I am delighted by that fact .
In particular , we support the compromise that was found on defensive measures against hostile takeover bids . Some Member States will be able to allow boards room for manoeuvre , others will leave it solely to the general meeting of shareholders .
For some people , the principal objective is not to achieve institutional equilibrium but to undermine it and destroy it .
The reason I am saying this is so that people can see how Cyprus could move just as easily in the direction of chaos as order .
Unfortunately it is suffering as a result of the recent intensification of the conflict in the Middle East .
On a matter which has drawn a number of comments , my group fully supports , recognises and celebrates the rights of citizens in a free society to demonstrate .
Mr President , I should also like to thank the rapporteur for his very efficient and effective work on this report .
This leads to inhumane situations and is not very effective if not taken on board out of one &apos; s own free will .
The Commission &apos;s report will look closely at the full range of issues that have characterised Macao &apos;s daily life during the first year of the SAR &apos;s existence .
Concerning legal migration , the Commission has initiated legal measures by submitting to Parliament the draft legislation on conditions for entry and residence for highly skilled workers and the single permit procedure for third @-@ country nationals .
Madam President , if the President @-@ in @-@ Office has a strong standpoint as the representative of the Council , why does he not publish it ?
But the objectives that are set out disregard reality and current dangers .
I would remind the President @-@ in @-@ Office that Greece sends generous financial aid to Albania and that over 600 000 Albanian immigrants work legally and without obstruction in Greece , earning wages that workers in Albania can only dream of .
I would like to thank the Commission and the rapporteur .
I dreamt that three Members of the European Parliament were enjoying having dinner together .
That is the point : if we do not get this right , we bring the whole of European law and the whole of our institutions into disrepute .
Two separate investigations into alleged dumping on the one hand , and alleged subsidization on the other hand , of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway were initiated by the Commission on 31 August 1996 .
I increasingly get the impression , though , that this comprehensive dialogue is becoming a fossilised and predictable ritual .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The threat of terrorism we are facing is a perfect example of external and internal policy being interlaced , not only in the physical sense when individuals and groups from outside the EU enter it with terrorist intentions , but even more so because we are dealing with networks and ideas that know no borders .
At the same time , I am sure that European sovereignty will gradually strengthen in the future .
While last week I was told that my question on the maintenance or modification of the decision to reduce the number of Spanish translators in the European Commission was going to be the third question to be replied to during this Question Time , last night I received a communication indicating that the President of Parliament had judged my question to be inadmissible .
I punished the outside consultants , I took them to court .
On the other hand , the only solution is to restore the role of nations and national Parliaments in the European decision @-@ making process .
If that is not the case , could he give me an example of some situation where non @-@ dialogue has worked ?
And I have to say to you , and especially to Mr Szymański , that public opinion polls indicate that 57 % of Poles do not want the death penalty .
What should have been done ?
It can be traced to the storage of organic grains in a warehouse that had been used in the past to store pesticides .
The lack of complementarity and coordination between the Union and Member States should not surprise any of us here when we look at the lack of complementarity and coordination and , I have to say , consistency within the European Union itself .
This time , when you look at the political agreement they have arrived at - which looks astonishingly like a common position already - we will possibly find it harder to change it .
This is a point to which we on the Committee on External Economic Relations have paid special attention , and it has been considered in paragraph 16 of the approved resolution , where its importance is emphasized and there is even a demand for &apos; the adherence to human rights conditionality in the bilateral relations between the EU and certain ASEAN member states &apos; .
in writing . - ( EL ) The Commission &apos;s proposal on soil protection is generalised and vague .
The difficult problem of how to divide up the proceeds between the two States concerned is resolved in Article 10 by allotting compensation payments and orders to pay court costs to the Issuing State and all other monies to the Executing State .
We must not allow any new divisions in the Western Balkans or lose any time , particularly to the detriment of the younger generation .
Against this background , regional economic integration per se should be seen as only one component of a process of building up a regional community of interest on which closer regional cooperation and , subsequently , regional integration can be developed .
At this stage , we can already state that , within the framework of this reorientation , the Commission is firmly committed to the closure of Chernobyl in the year 2000 , in accordance with the G7 Memorandum of Understanding .
With these counterfeit articles it is like banging our heads against a brick wall ; we do not seem to be able to stem the influx to any real degree .
Since 1994 , the Court of Auditors has refused to vouch for the correctness of the underlying transactions .
I would like , by way of a brief response to what Mr van Dam said , to point out that the DG Budget is not the DG with responsibility for financial control .
The Employment Strategy is just one part of the European debate , but this is the first time there has been a general downturn in the economy , the first time there has been anxiety and , however much we want to avoid creating fear or panic , the situation is clearly going to be more difficult and problems with employment and economic development are bound to appear at the beginning of next year .
This is a demand which Parliament is making and I would like to see it taken fully into account by the Commission and by the Council .
Only if the areas of agricultural policy , development policy , trade policy , financial policy and energy policy , as well as research , work together can improvements be achieved .
If the veto has frequently paralysed decision @-@ making with 15 Member States , just think what could happen with 25 or more .
On arrival you again passed through immigration control , waited in the queue and were then quizzed : why have you come , what are you going to do , how long are you staying ?
If you could do something about this , you would be helping both the countries with labour shortages and those with labour surpluses .
A future foot and mouth outbreak must never lead to a mass slaughter of livestock .
The human rights situation remains precarious , despite the reforms , which are mostly in place only on paper and are not being put into practice .
Therefore , on behalf of my group , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , I appeal most emphatically to the Member States to catch up with outstanding work on implementation .
The Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats has an extremely negative opinion of the report we are debating today .
That they are European players is not in doubt , but they are not yet in the stadium .
In 2004 the Commission finally launched the first phase of consultation with the social partners .
The latter penalty was even supported by Prime Minister Karzai in a statement made at a press interview in America .
As a result of these circumstances , this sector is increasingly becoming the province of workers from third countries .
I hope that all the people who signed up to that agreement , on the Pact for Stability and Growth , will honour it as it is written and that there will be no rearguard action either by members of the Monetary Committee or the Central Bankers or , indeed , any particular Finance Minister from any major Member State in the European Union to undermine the compromise that was reached in Dublin on that pact .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , the President of the Government of the Spanish State refuses , in a way which is arbitrary and quite contrary to the winds of history , to allow the Union &apos;s constituent nationalities and regions to play a role in the Union , not least in the Council of Ministers , and is trying to ignore the practices already in place in Germany , Belgium , the United Kingdom and Austria .
We want a strong Commission , which can act in an independent and neutral manner , but with political sense .
It is also replete with positive references to the Treaty of Lisbon , which we have strenuously opposed .
We must all work together to support the newcomers .
The Commission has chosen a horizontal approach that carries the danger that all professional qualifications will be lumped together .
At a time when ordinary people are seeing their pensions reduced , politicians must not save their own skins by using more of taxpayers &apos; money for their own pensions .
They seem logical measures to take , but not to the Commission .
( HU ) Allowing or banning mining ventures that use cyanide raises sensitive issues in certain Member States .
Anyone who does draw this distinction need not make a forced effort to keep religion out of political debate .
I welcome the continuing Commission commitment , repeated this afternoon by our colleague Mr Verheugen , to economic reconstruction in the Palestinian territories .
I wish to draw attention to the case of Marek Dochnal and Krzysztof Maciej Popenda , two Polish businessmen , who have been in captivity since October 2004 .
Thank you very much .
We would certainly want to push that agenda at the Council and hope to achieve in the future support from our other colleagues .
Your country , Sweden is a fairly exemplary country on this question .
Ireland has benefited greatly from EU funding to develop its rail and road infrastructure .
The government has also formed a committee to review all discriminatory laws , including the blasphemy law .
We are also urging China quickly and without reservations to ratify the United Nations &apos; International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which we consider to be key factors for improving individual rights .
It is with great sadness that we have learned of the dramatic events in Kauhajoki in the west of Finland , where 11 people have lost their lives in a very tragic incident at a school .
The recent events in Mumbai show that we have a long way to go in the area of consular services .
I say this because I have been looking in particular at Hungary and the legislation there may run the risk of creating certain privileges for the Hungarians on the other side of the Hungarian border , that is in the neighbouring countries of Slovakia and Romania .
I would just like to repeat what I said and encourage the Council to persist in maintaining the greatest possible vigilance so that those sectors are not fundamentally damaged by overly @-@ generous concessions .
I thank Mrs Estrela for her initiative and her work and the members of the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality who took part in this endeavour .
In this Parliament I speak for my group for environmental policy , consumer protection and health policy .
Mr President , one consequence of the lack of a single strategy for tax is that the standard of the state ’ s welfare provision at the heart of Europe can no longer be maintained , and this is becoming more and more the prime cause for jobs being moved elsewhere and lost to us .
The third problem is the security of individuals and property , and state security too , which is threatened by an explosion in crime , admittedly including some petty crime but mostly consisting of economic crime increasingly linked with international criminal networks .
We very much appreciate the work of the Dutch Minister , Mr Pronk , in seeking to find a way to solve the unresolved issues left over from The Hague , and we would appreciate it if the Commission could give us its view on how successful he has been to date and whether or not the work he has done has now cleared the way forward .
So how can we get citizens to participate ?
We started the year with a large predicted deficit in the 2003 budget .
The reason why we are not opposed to this draft text is so that workers who so desire can leave employment before retirement age .
I would also like to remind everyone that the Union will be growing in the near future .
We know that , regrettably , the Council under the Czech Presidency has adopted a very conservative attitude to the promotion of gender equality .
My second question concerns the way in which decisions are implemented .
Vietnam must honour the commitments it undertook and the Council and the Commission are called upon to remind it that the defence of human rights is a priority in our relations as well as in the context of the review of the agreements between the European Union and ASEAN .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I join in thanking Mr Turmes for the excellent work we have done together .
Presumably they were asked their opinion by the Council of Ministers before the Council agreed the common position .
Nevertheless , I would like to say that Yugoslavia was what it was , in the sense that the state managed to harmonise some of its people &apos; s ethnic differences to a degree . It must be pointed out that it did this at a time when its political framework was far from ideal in terms of being democratically representative .
We should not allow for any exceptions in this text .
I have tabled an amendment along with other colleagues , which is the 23rd one on this matter .
It is an important point , and I propose that we should have further discussions of everything the Commission is proposing – which the Summit will , I hope , take on board – in an inter @-@ parliamentary context .
Fossil fuels , the source of the extraordinary economic and industrial development of our societies over the past one hundred and fifty years , now pose an acknowledged risk for mankind , now that their unbridled use and the exponential production of CO2 are likely to alter our climate appreciably in the coming decades .
The Commission ’ s efforts will be channelled into ensuring that the priorities of financing from the funds and of relaunching the Lisbon Strategy run in tandem .
The economy and social cohesion in our countries constitute a fundamental priority .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( FI ) Madam President , Minister Lehtomäki , the Finnish government wanted to hold an EU summit in Finland , probably with the purpose of spreading the glad tidings of Finland &apos;s excellent competitiveness to others .
The basic conclusion is that current policies have failed in their main objective , namely , to reduce the demand for and supply of illicit substances , and are a key factor in exacerbating the harm to individual users , their environment , the economy and society .
Europe must attain a leading position in the rapidly growing area of the economy which is based on new technology for renewable energy sources .
We send our condolences to his loved ones in their hour of grief .
Countries cannot go away thinking the job is done : the job has not even started to be done , and we have to build upon that .
We should take account of the fact that PNR data are simply a tool that can be used by the law enforcement authorities along with other tools and information , because the question you have raised , to find out what the usefulness of such a use really is , cannot be appreciated except in a context in which police authorities use PNR data in conjunction with other instruments .
This may never mean wilful exclusion of older or disabled persons from these sectors .
Because we consider that a fair sharing of the burden is an important aspect of asylum policy , we are also in favour of introducing all relevant measures just as for the Dublin Convention and Eurodac .
This does not lend any credibility to our work .
That is why it is essential for our governments to show political leadership so as to encourage other States , such as the United States and China , to reach an agreement .
I hope that will not mean that the European Parliament loses credibility , and I particularly regret the tactical manoeuvring of the majority groups . Although there was wide support for the motion of censure , this is not the place for detailed discussion of the role of the committee of wise men - today should have been a day of political reckoning .
Successful operation of this regulation , however , requires much more research work to be carried out .
Commissioner , businesses are seriously worried about all this .
Turkey occupied the Northern part of Cyprus in 1974 and is still in occupation in the Northern part of Cyprus .
Before joining they must be able to demonstrate that they are able to abide by both EU environmental legislation and international treaties .
They use very few analgesics compared with us in the EU .
It is strange there is still controversy over the exact meaning of a definition which has applied for decades .
This would have been feasible in technical terms .
We note the significance of these frequencies , which so far have not been used and whose capacity to transmit mobile television , data or emergency services is now recognised , and which Parliament has expressed its particular commitment to .
We shall do what we can in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to contribute to the achievement of that aim .
Is it satisfied with the financial controls and monitoring of the programme ?
I therefore support the approach of using targeted marketing and advertising measures for wood products to raise public awareness .
A week before that , Mr Putin , who is not at all a frequent visitor to other countries , went with Mr Nazarbayev to Turkmenistan and , offering a slightly higher price for gas , signed a political agreement to the effect that all existing gas from Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan would go via Russia &apos;s pipelines .
Communication of Council common positions : see Minutes
I am fairly pleased with the result , and very pleased with the cooperation with the rapporteur .
I certainly noted with interest the points raised in relation to the services directive .
( HU ) Mr President , Commissioner Malmström &apos;s response was reassuring in respect of Serbia and Macedonia in that we do not intend to throw the baby out with the bath water .
I voted in favour of this extremely good report , because it insists on the need to take specific measures to eliminate poverty and social exclusion , by promoting a fair redistribution of income and wealth , thereby guaranteeing an adequate income and giving real meaning to the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion .
Europe also carries great expectations .
The implementation of the Lisbon Strategy requires an improvement of taxation rules to promote growth and employment .
It is therefore necessary to guarantee improved visibility of the financial effort .
However , there is one problem in this area .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin with an observation about the Russian President Mr Putin , who featured prominently in Mr Vanhanen &apos;s speech and , Mr President of the Commission , in your own .
I think we can be satisfied with the agreement that we have today .
For this reason the European Parliament has always supported giving maximum impetus to the association agreement between the European Union and Mercosur .
It is also to be hoped that this move will serve as an example for improving passenger protection on a worldwide scale .
As far as women &apos;s health and reproductive rights are concerned , I stress that particularly stressful living conditions , by which I mean the economy of survival based on the intensive exploitation of female human resources , the increase in violence against women and the fact that , in numerous countries , the health care systems have collapsed , put women &apos;s health at real risk .
In this cloud of structures , not always operating in perfect harmony in terms of the exchange of information , will this new body , which is supposed to network all of this information , have actual resources allowing it to exist ?
( FR ) Prime Minister , I will limit my remarks to the issue of immigration , a major concern for the future of Europe in relation to which you made some consensual proposals .
I do not like the term &apos; leftovers &apos; any more than Richard Corbett does .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - Mr President , I would just like to make some brief comments .
Research into biomarkers , into early diagnosis methods based on a multidisciplinary approach , the compilation of vast databases , and the search for curative medicines and appropriate treatment and service models would appear crucial .
The deletion of the rule prohibiting sales below cost price , as demanded by the Economic Committee and taken up by the Legal Affairs Committee , is right and proper .
But what is also of paramount importance , I think , is that we make sure in our declarations in the run up to Seville that these endeavours , which are right and proper , do not end up stealing the Convention &apos;s thunder and we make sure that the control functions tally and that Parliament &apos;s codecision function is not undermined .
For example , in my country two million small and 100 000 large wild game animals are hunted every year and there are 300 000 hunters .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.41 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this House had the opportunity to discuss this issue in the plenary on 25 October , and the debate on that occasion was a very matter @-@ of @-@ fact one , at which you , Commissioner , announced all the things that you intended to do .
In view of the calm that prevailed and the atmosphere of mutual respect among candidates , the electoral campaign gave us cause to hope that the result would be accepted by all the parties .
At the end of last year , the Union launched an initiative intended to improve political dialogue with the region .
While I agree that anti @-@ dumping measures must be used where they are necessary , the problem is , of course , whether you use them as a protectionist measure .
In addition , the region has vast natural resources of energy sources and minerals , and the EU has an interest in ensuring the security of the supplies needed for Europe &apos;s people and industries .
So I think Parliament must be able to prove that it can safeguard these important interests , and this is also why we want Parliament to have codecision rights on agricultural matters .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , our position on Turkey &apos; s accession to the European Union is well known .
Most of them have failed to follow this commitment through ; not even one @-@ half of the sum promised has actually been produced , although the developing countries have , in percentage terms , done more to meet the targets than have the countries of the North .
The new directives also introduce several simplifications and clarifications and definitions .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I begin by saying that the urban culture of our century could partly be described as a culture of noise .
The entire Commission can start by addressing the ten points in the resolution with regard to the discharge .
In reality , we now have a clearly inadequate base of young people , a very large platform of elderly classes and , necessarily , we are moving in the direction of a logic which is shifting from voluntary termination of pregnancy to voluntary termination of old age .
It is not a question of limiting the role of commercial television , or having them compete against each other .
Rule 156 gives the President enormous power in this respect , even if the Conference of Presidents disagrees with him .
It is understandable , but we are here to listen , as long as there are explanations of vote .
There is , however , no definition of such donations in the directive , and significant differences exist among the Member States as to what it really means in practice .
How can we dare to speak of economic and social cohesion in a society where there is an ever @-@ increasing disparity between the income of the richest and the poorest ?
We need as a Parliament to ensure that future meetings are arranged at a time to enable the Council and the Commission to participate , because the parliamentary part is , and can be , an invaluable long @-@ term development and communications platform .
You should also , of course , be allowed to make mistakes from time to time .
We have a lot of evidence of this : this has been confirmed not only by civil society organisations , not only by the European Commission and not only by different opinions of the European Parliament , but even the Hungarian legislature has confirmed that this is discrimination .
Mr Costa has proposed changes aimed at simplification , such as transferring Article 14 of Annex VII to the directive on interoperability .
The Commission has thus listened to Parliament , but has implemented - and may now , on the Council &apos;s recommendation , implement - the agreement they negotiated .
Therefore it is important to make the distinction between traders and brokers , as well as to clarify their roles and responsibilities .
It must be made very clear to the public that Parliament &apos;s power to put forward amendments is limited only by the Treaty itself . And even the Treaty is an open one , since it includes an open @-@ ended article - Article 235 - which allows the Council to extend its powers should that prove necessary , when requested by the Commission and supported by Parliament .
That scam has already caused student riots .
It is not by dismantling the common agricultural policy , on the wave of a pure and simple thrust towards savage liberalization , that the consumer is best protected , but with a policy of quality which the experience of BSE has taught everyone .
Failure to deliver on the commitments in the framework of the ‘ Everything but Arms ’ programme will seriously damage our credibility in respect of the LDCs .
For that and many other reasons we support the motion for a resolution .
Although some people tried to play it down and others tried to gear it towards system management or turn it into a meaningless debating club , the movement against capitalist globalisation raised its voice loud and clear against the imperialist war and global social injustice in Porto Alegre .
By moving away from the policy of supporting agriculture through prices , by shrinking into ourselves and encouraging nationalisation , by undermining this sector through a further increase in direct income aid , Europe is moving further and further away from its mission and the founding principles of the common agricultural market .
Your communication , Mr President of the Commission , is rather sketchy when it comes to the choices that will have to be made to meet emerging needs .
I regard this report on the military equipment industry as very frank and honest .
Mr President , the European Union had to develop this system of air traffic control , bringing together the 40 different networks currently in place in the EU , as a result of the projected increase in the volume of air traffic .
We owe this to our younger generations who no longer grow up under such regimes and whose awareness of totalitarianism in all its forms has become alarmingly superficial and inadequate , even in the five years since the expansion of 2004 .
The Holy Father , the late John Paul II , gave a very accurate and faithful description of this unique type of care and selfsacrifice by calling it the genius of women .
It obviously has to do with poverty , with lack of information and education , with patterns of sexual behaviour and , specifically , with young girls &apos; lack of education of a kind which would better enable them to resist sexual advances . It also has to do , of course , with the shortage of money within the health care sector .
Automatic stabilisers must be developed in the budget .
In addition , there are activities relating to sovereignty which the state has effectively reserved to itself , and there are institutions which do not fall into this category , which are neither companies nor state institutions , the &quot; independent charitable associations &quot; or not @-@ for @-@ profit organisations which the Commission refers to in its observations on Article 30 , as do we .
I would like to inform you that on the 29th in our committee we will have a wide @-@ ranging audience with the sector affected by this fisheries agreement with Morocco and the participation of the European Commission would also be desirable .
We have also had the recent announcement of oil slicks , degasification and oil damage in the Arctic .
The European Council held in @-@ depth discussions on the Union &apos;s immigration policy .
It was agreed at the Florence summit that these issues should receive priority .
This was one of the reasons why it was necessary to start work on a new , second @-@ generation information system , namely SIS II .
I voted in favour of the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) in favour of the Netherlands because I consider that instrument to be a valuable resource for the support of workers in difficulties on account of the economic crisis .
In addition , the Committee on External Economic Relations believes it is fundamentally important to establish operational mechanisms to coordinate the various European Union programmes and the PHARE programme if we are to optimize the return on Union resources and thus increase the effectiveness and incidence of the measures funded by them .
We have heard one speaker in favour and one against .
In this way , the EU &apos; s responsibility for the international legal order can be developed much more effectively .
I hope you do not mind me speaking in such personal terms .
A condition of a genuine environmental policy is that the economic policy instruments in legislation and other legislative acts go hand in hand .
I believe I can say that we all support it , but the important thing at the moment is , firstly , the existence of a public commitment by the Commission to exercise its right to initiative , a common will to consolidate a fundamental dimension for European citizenship and contribute immediately to the political parties beginning not only to exist in reality , but also to be legally recognised , because I believe that this is an important step towards the construction of European democracy .
Arguments in favour of the necessity of such measures are , principally , the current economic situation in which Europe finds itself , dangerous climate changes and threats to energy security .
I believe that until now we have failed to put in place a European policy on immigration .
We are responsible for what happens inside and outside the EU .
You know that we dedicate twenty minutes to each Commissioner .
I think that , with this report , we are , once again , one step closer to the realisation of the internal market .
( HU ) The Directive is undoubtedly an important step that will make it possible to move beyond the theoretical principles of the Treaty of Rome and provide the practical conditions for the free movement of services .
In the new draft regional aid guidelines , two principles have been of fundamental importance .
We need to take a sensible approach in order to identify a common position .
ENISA will be a centre of excellence that coordinates , analyses and gives advice .
Secondly , I share the rapporteur &apos;s concern because in Europe many early retirements do not involve replacement contractual arrangements , and I can say this as someone who lives in a region , Asturias , which has lost more than 12 000 direct jobs without any hope of these jobs being filled again by young people .
Secondly , I would like to mention Amendment No 5 which Mrs Dybkjær has already discussed briefly , that is , the use of beeswax as a preservative for surface treatment of peaches and pineapples .
We look forward to hearing your declaration , and I should like to say in conclusion that this is an important measure , which must be done well and be done quickly .
Unfortunately , it is not Mr Arafat who holds the key to ending this nightmare , but Mr Sharon .
The challenge is not negligible .
We cannot realise such ideals by opting for a voluntary system like EMAS .
( IT ) Madam President , there is no doubt that bringing this draft legislation to Parliament for debate after 18 months of intense work should be greeted favourably .
Thank you very much for your words , Madam President .
The framework programme presents measures connected with pollution in an unsatisfactory way , and in particular pays too little attention to the fact that energy @-@ saving schemes can help us try and have an impact on people &apos;s lives .
Mr President , Mr Vice @-@ President of the Commission , honourable Members , I am delighted to see that the subject of today &apos;s debate is the future of the European aerospace industry , for this industry embodies Europe &apos;s forward @-@ looking approach , its high technology and its potential for future growth , and makes a considerable contribution to achieving the goals of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment , with Airbus being its most prominent project .
The report addresses a very serious problem and clearly indicates the need for action to get to grips with the widespread exclusion that affects many Roma today .
If terrorist organisations are being financed from abroad - and this is certainly the case - then it is difficult for us to provide these conditions .
The SBA also calls for greater recognition of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs .
My group is urging both the EU institutions and the Member States to show a united front during the Review Conference , and argue forcefully in favour of new initiatives in terms of disarmament , in general , and nuclear disarmament , in particular .
The amendment seeks to establish a system of charges which all vessels would have to pay systematically each time they dock in a port , whether or not they make use of the waste disposal facilities .
Indeed , since 2002 and with the specific provisions of 2004 , the issue has no longer been seen merely in terms of protecting human life at sea and environmental impact , but also of preventing terrorist attacks .
As things stand at the moment , it will presumably not be implemented at all .
I support the actions promoted in this area : the promotion of humanitarian principles and international humanitarian law ; improvements in terms of quality of the coordination and consistency in the delivery of EU humanitarian aid ; clarification on the use of military and civil protection resources and capabilities in accordance with the Humanitarian Consensus and UN guidelines ; disaster risk reduction and reinforcement of the link between emergency aid , rehabilitation and development .
. As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , I welcome Mrs Roure ’ s outstanding report .
That will take place in due course .
The incomplete single market in areas such as energy forces us to bow to the conditions dictated by external parties , which has a direct impact on our competitiveness .
On the contrary .
The need to draw up public budgets through a gender perspective , with the ultimate aim of achieving genuine equality between men and women , stems from our belief that budgets are not neutral tools but in fact reflect the way power is distributed in society .
When it does , we will be able to be more specific regarding the decisions it intends to adopt .
I also dare to hope that this House will not overplay its hand , as the English sometimes say .
These measures affect the secondary market in securities , but I believe there is a strong case to apply the same principles to the primary market , particularly in the unique situation of the eurozone debt @-@ issuing members .
We can encourage , we can suggest , we can try to convince , but it has to be decided by the national governments .
They are , in fact , also responsible for the credibility of the Non @-@ Proliferation Treaty as it currently stands .
Development aid is not only for farmers , it is intended for all sections of society .
Thirdly , with intervention grain stocks at an alarming low and the ratio with usage being totally out of kilter , there urgently needs to be action to address that balance .
This is what we must do : take preventative action , certainly ; strike right where the danger lies , not among the bargeloads of wretched people reaching Lampedusa – they are certainly not the danger – but among those who recruit and organise them in not all but a great many mosques , not all but many prayer centres .
… that there are so very few Members in the Chamber .
The war in Spain was not just a war and it was not just Spanish .
Examples of this are the migration flows in our direction , the deterioration of our environment and the dangers presented to our society by radical fundamentalism .
We have overruled and mixed up what we have voted for in the draft Statute by the previous vote .
Right now , all we can do is support the resolution .
The Commission &apos;s objective is to improve the Works Council Directive and to do so within this parliamentary term , and all the deadlines naturally depend on this .
As far as education and vocational training are concerned , the key factors listed in the European strategy for smart , sustainable and inclusive growth need to be translated into practical steps at European Union level and in the Member States .
For this reason , I greatly regret that we were unable to counter it with a common response .
Perhaps it could be done .
I cannot guarantee that the system will work .
Our own regional Minister for Agriculture in the Flanders Region , Mrs Dua , has mentioned levies on meat .
I can tell you straight away who is not to blame for this .
. Mr President , up until recently , a swift and extensive enlargement of the European Union was suggested as a tremendous step forward , and as something meriting universal support .
But there is a desire from consumers that we should address the question of the natural production of food .
It is the duty of Europe and our Parliament to remind everyone of that this morning !
I think that this is the right time to make your statement , if you want , which we can then append to the letter to the Tunisian authorities .
I believe that the European Parliament and the national Parliaments and civil society are going to be watching closely .
Through the Treaty of Lisbon , we have created new relationships , and these new relationships must not be undermined again through the back door .
In our first action programme , eEurope 2002 , we had a special approach to e @-@ transport , but it was not , unfortunately , able to create sufficient interest among the Member States .
This happened in the case of Nelson Mandela and more recently Leyla Zana .
This is a strong example where those Euro @-@ sceptics who resist cooperation in this field are wrong .
The same applies to the actual implementation of equality of opportunity , an area that still causes me some concern , not only in the new Member States , but also in one or two of the present ones .
In this way I wish to facilitate the uniform interpretation and application of Community rules and laws , and the creation of a unified system of legal safeguards .
There will be great political consequences from EMU which have very often being underplayed or even denied by its proponents .
In particular I welcome his latest compromise proposal on paying for the costs of dealing with orphan waste .
As regards security in Afghanistan , there is no doubt that it must be a priority if we want to implement reconstruction and development programmes with future guarantees .
When can we expect to see this specific regulation ?
It does not matter how much style and gloss you put on a project , because if the substance is rotten then it will fail .
The proposal for a regulation will suffer from the same weaknesses as the Dublin Convention since the basic principles are , fundamentally , identical .
Resumption of the session
However , I would like to start by objecting to the implicit link that Mr Frattini makes with the failed terrorist attacks in the UK last week .
This can be done by creating bonds in the EU , more specifically in the fields of energy , transport and telecommunications . The second is to increase the participation of SMEs in the Single Market by developing their funding sources and by improving their access to capital markets , by eliminating fiscal barriers to their cross @-@ border activities , and by revising the public procurement framework in order to make procedures more flexible and less bureaucratic .
In doing so , we are listening to all voices , including those of the Members of this House .
Also in the context of the G7 , nuclear safety issues will be discussed in relation both to the situation in Russia and to the need to maintain loan commitments to Ukraine , following the closure of the Chernobyl plant , for the construction of the K2R4 reactors there .
Let us , rather , have a bunch of jumped @-@ up Prussian @-@ style Junkers running agriculture everywhere in the EU .
Do you know that few trapped passengers have been assured by their companies that they will be paid for overnight accommodation and that , of them , most obtained payment because they drove a hard bargain with the companies , while the majority received nothing ?
As regards the exchange rate policy - and here I take advantage of the situation to respond to questions which have often been raised outside Parliament on this subject - the European Council , by emphasizing the responsibility which will be laid upon the Community due to the introduction of the euro , is insistent on the necessity for full application of the provisions of the Treaty to ensure that , as between the Council and the European Central Bank , there is an exchange of views and information on the euro exchange rate .
The Commission also welcomes the support which this House is giving the Green Paper and we shall take account of the proposals and opinions which Parliament presents in its report .
That would be a fatal error . That is why dialogue between cultures is so important .
The Constitutional Treaty is a compromise that does not completely satisfy anyone , but it nonetheless most represents what we have been able to achieve in the convention .
You have given the European Union more political weight and have improved its reputation in the world .
I want to avoid animal suffering and ensure we have humane methods of killing or at least less painful .
So when you have something which is priceless to look after , it is unacceptable to make comprises as regards the economic dimension of what you have to look after and the measures you take .
On the basis of the convention model , we want the result of that convention also to be the role played by the governments in the Intergovernmental Conference .
( ES ) Mr President , the historic and irreversible move towards democracy in the Arab countries did not end with the still @-@ fragile transitions in Egypt and Tunisia , nor with the support , also historic , of the international community for the activation of the principle of responsibility to protect the Libyan population .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I must first congratulate Mr Busk because he has worked hard , but I must express my disagreement with the content of the amendments that we are going to vote on this morning .
When I talk about exchange , I am thinking of Europol , I am thinking of Eurojust , I am thinking of COSI , which has been mentioned here by some Members , and , lastly , I am thinking of the exchange of information and how to make it more effective .
In our quest to meet the challenges facing the EU on the world stage and in light of our new size and scale , we must always ensure that all parties are involved , be they social partners , NGOs , local authorities or regional authorities .
The first is the preservation of a multilateral framework for trade .
This shows precisely the difference between ideology and practice .
If we say ‘ yes ’ to a fixed incentive of six months , our children will soon benefit , thanks to the European Union , from appropriate , safe medicinal products .
That would have to be achieved by calling in private profit @-@ oriented businesses , by reducing the number of services , by having the work done by fewer people and by increasing contributions from users .
The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection has put its finger on the health aspects .
The first is that illegal immigrants themselves are risking their lives , and indeed hundreds are losing their lives , turning the Mediterranean sea into a graveyard and putting us all to shame .
This also applies to the common European foreign policy on energy .
Pursuant to the Rules of Procedure , Mr Burns was going to be given the floor now .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , first of all the key question of this debate today is what we can expect from this European Council on Thursday and on Friday .
( SV ) Madam President , Mr Topolánek , Mr Barroso , it is absolutely correct that we are in the midst of two crises : a climate crisis and a financial crisis .
Today &apos;s debate is taking place as representatives of all the Member States and of the Parliament are meeting in Dublin .
Let me make it clear that we are talking here about dishes officially permitted for human consumption .
The series of votes led us to take the responsibility of voting against it .
These conditions will give hope to the local populace and prospects for a better life at home .
We are fully in line with Parliament in saying that , without a systematic improvement of the human rights situation in Iran , our relations with Iran cannot develop properly .
I can state one thing , namely that we Swedish Conservatives will defend and safeguard our being able in Sweden to make decisions about our labour market and our rules , but we shall also defend openness .
Surely that cannot be our waste @-@ disposal policy !
( DE ) Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit , you heard me say that the EU must take a position with regard to dictators that are still in power and are currently still accepted partners of the European Union , and we should do so before revolutionary changes occur in the countries concerned with regard to human rights , democratisation and the rule of law .
I think we both accept that such an agreement is no longer appropriate in today &apos;s climate after the Lisbon Treaty .
It is therefore well worth discussing together what steps we need to take next .
This was the case in 2008 and , starting in 2009 , there will be annual assessment by Member States as part of all national reform programmes .
Mr President , in modern economies , the budget balance operates as an automatic stabiliser of the real economy .
It is also important that the Commission guarantees the aid by attaching certain economic conditions to it , so that it is used properly in the right areas , for example , in improving administration , organising basic civil services and increasing economic efficiency .
I believe it is an excellent report .
Lastly , drivers must be properly informed about their new rights and duties .
I have a second piece of information , which is that the Commission communication regarding the White Paper on European Governance shall be followed by consultation with the political groups , on the understanding that the main debate will take place at the next part @-@ session or at the October 1 part @-@ session at the latest .
&lt; empty &gt;
I think we must only consider initiatives that can really make a difference .
Biofuels will contribute to Europe ’ s energy self @-@ sufficiency , at a time of rising oil prices and in light of the recent controversy over gas supplies from Russia .
I think we all agree that people who want to migrate should do so as a matter of free choice .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
I think it is vital that we have a framework to prevent exploitation of people because of their religion , age , disability , education or marital status .
My wish is that there might be a new tax system , as soon as possible , in which as well as economic criteria , social and environmental parameters are finally taken into account within a rigorously accountable dimension .
Every month , we adopt a large number of resolutions , and we often have debates on human rights violations outside the Union , yet the issue of human rights within the Union comes up only once a year .
In effect we will be saying that languages spoken by a few hundred people in some cases , and I agree with the support of those languages , are more important to the EU than others spoken by hundreds of thousands .
Research , development , innovation , investments in energy efficiency , renewable energy , trans @-@ European communication and energy interconnection networks , climate change and education are just some of the priorities that this EU budget must cover .
I am thinking above all of the need to adapt certain sectors of our economy to our other goals of combating climate change .
( Parliament gave its assent )
. In the digital age it is important that copyright and intellectual property problems do not prevent broadcasters using their archives .
This is a blind alley and we must find a different way forward .
I would add – to those people who are constantly claiming to be Europeanists – that less money means the renationalisation of the cohesion policy , which is equivalent to less Europe .
I welcome the interest that enterprises , individuals , NGOs and public authorities have shown in the Single Market Act , since it is crucial that we have a broad consensus on measures to tailor the Single Market according to the expectations of our citizens and enterprises .
Compromises are always a matter of give and take , of course , yet I believe that this text meets the requirements of all the parties concerned .
This initiative must be reflected in specific measures and integrated guidelines .
Furthermore , in my opinion they realise that a unilateral declaration of independence on 4 May could provoke a reaction from the Israelis - as already announced - and that such a reaction would damage the peace process .
This would not surprise me , because we cannot achieve a change in this way .
The financial ruin of the Polish shipyards is of interest to those who expect large profits from taking over their assets and the attractive land on which the shipyards stand .
I suspect those reports filter as far up as directors @-@ general in the European Commission . I suspect those reports do not touch the desks of European Commissioners .
Ladies and gentlemen , on the reverse side of Europe there is solidarity , and , on the front side , responsibility .
Member States will have the opportunity , through the regulation we shall also propose for post @-@ 2013 , to take account of these specific issues in the context of environmental measures and to provide a specific support system in this area .
The policy must be ongoing in nature , and have commonly agreed aims and appropriate limits in terms of time periods and areas covered .
Now is perhaps the time to take greater heed of fishermen &apos;s opinions , based on centuries of knowledge and an awareness that fishermen can only survive if they respect the interests of the marine environment .
I resisted making those same comments to other Commissioners tonight .
In this sense it may be useful - and here I am addressing the Commissioner - to draw up a water protocol for inclusion in the text of the post @-@ Kyoto agreements .
I agree with the report when it supports the Commission &apos;s approach and extends the use of reversed qualified majority voting to block a Commission decision in the Council .
We cannot allow ourselves any more failed Financial Perspectives in the future .
We will endeavour to secure the remaining EUR 2.4 billion through a compensation at the conciliation of the 2010 and 2011 budgetary procedures by using all - and I quote , because it is important - &apos; by using all means foreseen in its legal framework and without prejudice to the financial envelopes of the co @-@ decided programmes and the annual budgetary procedure &apos; .
All I can do now is to promise to strive for it .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is a fine thing to celebrate the triumph of democracy , all the more so because it has triumphed in part thanks to us , the European Parliament , and not to the ever @-@ conservative European Commission .
Threatening to fine a nearly bankrupt nation feels like an empty threat , and promises of continual eurozone bailouts will always bring moral hazard .
Today was about reviewing the situation on the ground and assessing the consequences for relations between the European Union and Russia .
To protect non @-@ professional investors , financial companies need to take the trouble to check their level of knowledge and their resources .
The people of Europe are fed up with these press conferences that follow Councils , during which each country , each government representative , only tells half the truth , taking care to disguise the other half , the things he has said behind closed doors .
It is also essential that everything be done to facilitate the Member States &apos; transposition of their national objectives if the strategy is to be successful and correctly implemented .
Back in 2008 , signs of serious breaches of the Kimberley Process rules in the Marange diamond fields in Zimbabwe had already been detected .
Despite my doubts , I wish the EIT an excellent start and a successful future .
The greatest problem facing citizens with disabilities is of course their much higher levels of unemployment .
Providing assistance now also means stability and security for us - freedom and stability go hand in hand .
Not so long ago , Slovakia was a candidate for membership of NATO and the European Union .
For the most part they have done so because they were fleeing terror , torture and persecution , but also - and we must not underestimate this - because they come from hopeless social and economic backgrounds .
This proposal thus gives added impetus to the stabilisation and association process .
I therefore regard it as a matter of urgency for the European Union to intervene politically , because we cannot simply stand by to witness the likely explosion of Africa &apos;s largest country .
Our task now is to ensure that we achieve this goal as soon as possible .
I would also like to stress the individual responsibility of Member States in preparing for the Year of Equal Opportunities , and would like to propose a number of initiatives myself .
My view is that national countries must decide on their own drugs policy .
Please explain to the voters in your country that if we adopt the EU budget , then it will actually be possible to pay out the cohesion funds within the European Union in the long term .
( FR ) Mr President , I should simply like to draw the translation services &apos; attention to the quality of the French translation .
It still maintains its thrust and they do not give excess baggage to it .
On the one hand , it is an example of a robust industrial policy with its own research and social arm , whose carefully regulated and focused long @-@ term strategy has , broadly speaking , succeeded in bringing structural change to the sector .
I have already been accused of not answering one question .
The Union has already entered into commitments along these lines , and it would be well for all the Member States to do the same , following the example of our German and Dutch friends .
Unfortunately , the Member States and the Commission are often on opposite sides of the negotiating table , even though they should really be on the same side .
Instead of being selective in our outrage at what is happening in Togo , let us help to put a stop to the military and economic protection of regimes of this kind .
Without truth , there can be no reconciliation .
Not at all , and I think that the German government has done well to say that given that we are sticking to operational responsibility for the moment , we do not need to discuss in detail the principle of unities .
We are talking about war and peace .
It is my firm belief that no true scientist enjoys experimenting on animals or does so when alternative means of research are available .
This is despite the serious and professional work of the Italian Presidency – and I would like to publicly thank Mr Frattini , Mr Antonione for their efforts .
Subject : Measures to stimulate investment in increasing energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies
It has been a long and arduous process , but it is all very rewarding in the end , especially for the two countries , which were not able to join in 2004 .
There is one very positive fact .
Try telling that to our fishermen and farmers !
Firstly , to make the freedoms enshrined in the Treaty more effective and more real , particularly the mobility of workers .
I hope the Portuguese authorities will assess the amount of damage as soon as possible and also that no formal administrative obstacles will be placed in the way of providing financial assistance from the European Union Solidarity Fund .
The rapporteur provides some of this service by rightly identifying the present economic model as detrimental to sustainable development .
Once this measure has reached cruising speed , the CO2 emission of one million passenger cars will have been eliminated , which is quite impressive !
The problem of youth unemployment is growing .
The fires in Greece have demonstrated the ever @-@ increasing threat of yet another form of terrorism : arson terrorism .
If we cannot even honour the principles of democracy when we decide on the fundamental rights of our citizens , then when can we ?
This House argued for the invocation of Article 42 of the Treaty , allowing these measures to be brought within the first pillar .
In the public interest – and a great many members of the public are in fact keen to know this – I would ask you again to give a proper answer to the question as to what action is taken against a Minister or Council member who discloses details of who said what during confidential talks in closed session .
It is also satisfactory - and the rapporteur mentioned this - that the democratic representation of the ACP countries has undoubtedly improved and we are on the point of implementing genuine measures to ensure this representation , a reflection of the process of democratization which is happily in progress , not without upsets and setbacks , in many of the ACP countries .
The regime is politically authoritarian , yet has a liberal attitude to the economy , religion and customs .
There is no question but that this resolution only resolves and deals with part of the problem and that we cannot turn a blind eye to the fundamental problem .
Proposal for a Council Regulation ( COM ( 96 ) 0422 - C4 @-@ 0448 / 96 @-@ 96 / 0212 ( CNS ) ) amending Regulation ( EEC ) No 1765 / 92 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops and repealing Regulation ( EEC ) No 1872 / 94
Such a strategy should include development aid and political dialogue with the transitional federal government .
In the Treaty of Accession , the ten new Member States were granted the right to delegate one member each to , among other bodies , the European Court of Auditors .
Is this compulsory unified policy one that has been determined by the larger countries for their own benefit and to the detriment of smaller countries , or could it one day perhaps backfire on the larger countries themselves ?
If the codecision procedure is not operated in an effective manner , then inefficiency will take root in the internal decision @-@ making procedures of the Union .
Too much legislation will lead to rigidity in the system .
( The oral amendments were accepted )
This controversial research has no scientifically positive results and , as our rapporteur has pointed out , is high @-@ risk .
I should like to remind you that digital audiobroadcasting has existed since 1989 and the main problem that still remains to be solved relates to the fact that the receivers are still too large .
There have already been demonstrations this weekend .
The somewhat divergent provisions and intentions of the two documents have created disturbance and uncertainty among all the postal operators , employees and consumer representatives concerned .
This situation is , at the same time , a criticism of the Council , which is requested to draft general rules .
So Europe is reacting , albeit slowly , but better late than never .
One of these is , of course , the fact that we continue to subsidise conventional technology , that is to say technology powered by fossil fuels .
At the same time , evaluation is not consistently applied and rarely results in concrete corrective action .
On the one hand , in a multipolar world where the BRIC countries are gaining ever more influence , it is vital that the EU establishes a privileged relationship with Latin American countries , where it holds more investment than Russia , India and China put together .
Self @-@ employed women often have to grapple with the problem that becoming a mother could endanger their livelihood .
The brunt of this adverse impact will be felt in the Mediterranean countries , including Greece , because these are the countries which produce these products and most processing units in these countries are small- or medium @-@ sized .
Both approaches challenge the European social model . Further , they fail to take into account that at Lisbon , a 3 % sustained growth of GDP was considered necessary to achieve full employment by 2010 .
I think it is our duty to remind the Council , and the Commission where it is appropriate - that the right way to bring the Chinese Government round to the basic principles of democracy and the state of law , is this resolution tabled by the United States due to be voted on in the next few days by the Human Rights Commission in Geneva .
We have completed the first , and nothing further needs to be done now with regard to the annex .
The strategy was based on an analysis of the major global challenges at that time , but today , as I said , some are more relevant than others five years ago , and we also have new ones .
In the streets of Hong Kong we saw Korean farmers fighting for their livelihoods , small Korean farmers threatened by transnational grain corporations which are bargaining under the guise of endeavouring to help developing countries .
First , liberalisation of the railway networks in the Member States and the establishment of a common market for railway services is addressed from the point of view of free access and transit rights for the infrastructures of the Member States in cross @-@ border traffic , especially freight traffic .
Mr President , I fully agree with the report and with what the rapporteur has just said .
The aim of this directive is to harmonize the conditions for comparative advertising with a view to completing the internal market and thus facilitating the free movement of publicity services within the Union .
It leads to the non @-@ completion of schooling , to child labour , to increased numbers of children in danger , to illegal immigration , to fundamentalism and to terrorism .
My second point relates to the conditions governing the entry into force of the future European Constitution . The Constitution must be able to come into force on the basis of a strengthened double majority of the Member States and the people and , on this point , despite the fact that he is not here at this precise moment , I would like to congratulate Mr Prodi on having been directly responsible for conducting an investigation into a summary document .
The Turkish authorities continue to deny the genocide of Armenians and Syrians at the beginning of the previous century .
This says more about the Swedish Presidency than it says about the EU .
The problem already exists and this would simply serve to completely confuse current policies .
These are specific questions .
We know , however , that the problem will be the 3 % of products that will not be allowed to freely access Northern hemisphere markets .
This is curious since the European Union has a framework for a ban available in the 1993 Directive .
In this regard , I would also like to say that I personally hope there will be some forward @-@ looking , constructive and positive issues that citizens wish to raise concerning the EU project , so that it does not continually turn out to be the &apos; no &apos; camp that always monopolises the use of this sort of initiative .
This is what I have done on behalf of the Socialist Group .
Once again , the governments of the Member States have not been equal to the circumstances .
The use of information technology for facilitating payments , records and so on and the use of e @-@ Health information technology have been mentioned .
Mr President , we have a number of financing instruments to deal with today .
The question is : if there is no problem with Hungarian minority &apos;s rights why would the Romanian leadership want to erase parts of paragraph 26 ?
I would like to mention one further matter : the mercury strategy is not yet complete .
I would question the wisdom of this parliament in producing this report and in doing so pass judgement on other cultures and their values .
I am a staunch opponent of the death penalty but logically we should oppose it everywhere .
Mr President , as the rapporteur , Mr Pirker , has said , this Parliament has already expressed its opinion more than once on the proposed Eurodac Agreement .
To return to the title and content of the declarations , I should like to make it clear at this point that the stricter controls of mosques do in no way entail a violation of the freedom of religion .
Unfortunately , we are therefore now in the position of speaking about those who have been kidnapped and are being held by the pirates .
I should also like to know how these preparations have progressed over the past year and over the last few months since the appointment of a common European coordinator .
So what more have we to do ?
It is everyday life in the so @-@ called moderate Islamic world .
It guarantees fairer conditions for session musicians in relation to soloists .
I will first go back to the report by Mrs Lefrançois on combating terrorism .
So it is appropriate and commensurate that sanctions be discussed and implemented at UN level .
Mr Kreissl @-@ Dörfler &apos;s report shows very precisely the great risk the MAI will represent in respect of our European social , cultural and political model and , more fundamentally still , for democracy and people &apos;s capacity to control their own destiny in general .
Next , the possibility of less stringent provisions for private individuals if the private employment conditions are in order .
( DE ) Do you share the view that the preparation and approval of a new basic treaty or constitutional treaty or simply of a new treaty is a prerequisite for the accession of Macedonia , Croatia or other countries of the western Balkans ?
Last but not least , the Commission is willing to improve the coherence and efficiency of the European Union ’ s action in the international arena .
In producing this proposal for a regulation , the Commission has now created a legal basis .
We are not combating global warming ; we are not dealing with the effects of the CO2 problem ; we are not researching and promoting renewable energy sufficiency and we are complacent on the issue of nuclear technology .
How does the Council - and , what is more , the Commission - plan to exert its influence to reform and improve the regime that is being enforced against the Kurds ?
Then there is the Armenian genocide , the Kurdish issue , civil liberties , social tensions – I could go on with a long list of undeniable contrasts that count against Turkey joining the European Union .
I hope that will be to his satisfaction .
Otherwise a good provision in our new Rules of Procedure is misused to give lengthy explanations , which often have nothing to do with the report .
Since the start of Israel &apos;s military campaign in the Gaza Strip on 27 December , we have witnessed a steep deterioration of the situation on all levels .
The ECOFIN Council deleted this . I want to know why .
That is why we welcome the fact that the basic aim of the provisional agreement consists in offering an adequate framework for a global dialogue which permits the development of close relations between the parties , as well as progressive and reciprocal liberalization of trade , supporting the economic and social development of the Palestinian territories .
Madam President , as I have very little time , I will direct my remarks to the Cabrol report .
That would soon encourage the water companies to take a more responsible attitude .
The government in Haiti is very weak , and distribution of aid is largely in the hands of a diversified and very strange elite , and it is very important that international organisations and the European Union know to whom the money is really going .
I maintain it all comes to the same thing , and that only honourable Members skilled in hair @-@ splitting could come up with differences in meaning between these various phrases .
Furthermore , I think it is important to enter into a debate with the United States about the UN ’ s future .
If you could give us your support on this , Mrs Karamanou , your report could well secure an overwhelming majority .
The ICRC has , since January 1998 , been gathering information on people who disappeared in Kosovo .
In conclusion , let me reiterate the risk that we run as a Parliament if we dilute our effort by not concentrating on the main issue and insist on poking our nose into matters which are not our competence .
Additional Commission contribution to the IGC
That is why I believe also that this two @-@ year review clause is sensible .
I would also like to mention - which has partly been forgotten - that further education is needed for our management too .
The debate is closed .
In the letter of understanding that the Commission forwarded to Parliament , and in its communication on cohesion policy and the environment , the Commission has listed a great many measures in relation to which , as the latest discussions with the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection have shown , we have definitely made some progress , although this can only be recorded in future reports .
One thousand three hundred and fifteen metres is the width of Gaza &apos;s militarised border , which can only be crossed on foot , even by the elderly and children , after interminable checks : it is an incredibly grim crossing , like something from another time .
This idea of respecting international law , including humanitarian legislation on human rights and refugees , is essential .
We politicians , of course , have a particular responsibility in this respect .
The European Union must make a stand .
The European Commission has , however , committed itself to ensuring that the proposed reform will not bring into question either the timeliness of the measures or the way in which they operate and will not affect either the sources of financing or the level of Community support .
What you are trying to create is a precursor for a constitution that is impossible to find because in fact you have reached a dead end and you know perfectly well that the construction of Europe has turned into an unbelievable preachifying mass of texts and declarations .
I therefore think that we need to learn a great deal from this about what people on the street think , and not think that it is only those who demonstrate , in what is a more than festive atmosphere , on the occasion of a European Council , who have democratic legitimacy in the Union , because that is not the case .
My group believes that we need to give serious consideration to &apos; fair trade &apos; bananas , produced using sustainable methods in countries which respect human rights and so on . And customers must be able to identify which these are .
I am talking about Corsica , in the French Republic , where there are people who are Corsican , who love Corsica , and who speak Corsican in their villages ; but that is no threat to national unity .
He is evidently more optimistic than I am . I do not really think that crises have a purifying effect .
In this respect , especially in the field of science and technology , there is still a long way to go , because work has been done in other fields such as health , education , etc . , but there has not been a great deal of work done in the field of science and technology .
If Mr Corbett wants to push anything , perhaps he might support my call - which I made in previous Parliaments - for the Members of this Parliament to have a vote on this issue to clear up the matter once and for all .
The consumption of alcohol by adolescents and , alas , more and more often by children , is a real cause for concern and we must do our utmost , we who are supposed to be responsible adults , to protect young Europeans against the abuse or , as the rapporteur calls it , the harmful use of alcohol .
It is thus the job of governments and scientists to convince producers and consumers of the need for change .
I , for one , am not satisfied that the private sector , in particular - or , for that matter , the public sector - have in place sufficient safeguards for the destruction of data which is no longer needed in the fight against terrorism .
Fourthly , we wish to deal with the Council in terms of foreign policy and security .
I therefore welcome the fact that the Austrian Presidency reopened this debate by presenting a strategic document on the Union &apos;s migration and asylum policy .
Thank you also for your answer , which was comprehensive .
I give the floor first to Mrs Ferrero @-@ Waldner , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council .
We have finally reached an agreement and I would like to congratulate Mrs Hautala on such a satisfactory outcome .
It is therefore important that this should be added to the agenda of our meeting with Russia and also to that of the G8 summit .
We are always discussing quantities , but we must look at how they are spent and invested .
However , a lot remains to be done .
In this regard , I should just like to recall that on 20 May 2000 the Mexican Parliament approved this cooperation by 89 votes to 11 with two abstentions .
This visa waiver agreement for holders of diplomatic , service or official passports represents a step forward in the establishment of full reciprocal visa exemption in accordance with Regulation ( EC ) No 539 / 2001 .
Perhaps I might mention a few of the many successful initiatives taken .
I see further opportunities for exploring synergies with , for example , integrated pest management .
This is absolutely crucial .
I should like to highlight other positive elements such as the EUR 40 million increase in the general budget and the award of 15 % in funds for transnational projects .
Yes , in my view , yes .
However , we must also make sure that there is no excessive drug consumption as a result of commercial promotion .
One challenge still lies ahead , and that is the adoption of the Regulation establishing a European Instrument for the Promotion of Democracy and Human Rights ( EIDHR ) .
For a long time , it was too early to discuss it .
In addition , US interests will be able to own up to 49 % voting stock in EU airlines , whilst the reciprocal agreement allows just 25 % voting stock for EU interests in US airlines .
I believe that Parliament ’ s rights in foreign trade matters need to be reinforced as a matter of urgency , and that this is a quite separate matter from the constitutional treaty .
The Council too , and specifically the UK Presidency , are to be congratulated on this result .
I wish someone from the Council had been here this morning : we needed them to be here .
There was a wave of arrests of Democratic Society Party ( DTP ) members , and the threat of arrest still hangs over members of the Turkish Parliament .
We must now join forces in order to adopt a new , definitive agreement .
It is good that these changes are coming about , establishing common principles governing the election procedure .
What is more , the project provides a good basis for the construction of an integrated security network , ensuring defence against cyber attacks .
My second observation concerns the references made to asylum policy .
In the framework of the stability pact , UNMIK is exploring ways of embedding Kosovo in the process of regional trade liberalisation and has already signed the Memorandum of Understanding on the regional electricity market in south @-@ east Europe .
Anyone who thinks that by approving the common position they will be done with these recurring ethical questions has got it wrong .
Member States should also step up their communication efforts regarding the use of new technologies , such as smart research information services , by announcing forthcoming research challenges and distributing research findings .
In conclusion , the final topic .
The most astonishing statement came in fact from the finance ministers .
The employment strategy and the social funds are both designed to combat discrimination and secure inclusion in society .
That is why it is crucial for us to agree on sound procedures that are ultimately monitored by the Commission .
Draft general budget of the European Union - 2009 budget ( vote )
On 22 February , the Union actually upgraded its association agreement with Israel , promising to step up cooperation in several apparently technical agreements in various areas : competition , access to public contracts , Israel &apos;s integration into the European Research Area and into European agencies such as Europol , the European Space Agency and so on .
Only then can the consumers be offered a wide spectrum of choices .
Clearly the Commission does not dare look the citizens in the eye and explain that &apos; this has gone wrong , we made a mistake here , but we tried to achieve this in this way.&apos;
Finally , the Commission wants it to be possible for agreements which are not individually notified , but which nevertheless qualify for exemption , to be exempt with retroactive effect from the date on which they were concluded .
On 25 March , Europeans not only sang the Ode to Joy , but really felt that joy .
The theme of quality of life takes centre stage , such that people with disabilities may fulfil their expectations while keeping their human dignity .
The authors of this report have laid an egg and I suggest they scramble it .
The seminar of government experts must also include the question of promoting environmental technologies and innovation .
It is regrettable that this ultimately cost him his life .
The vote will take place on Thursday , 19 June 2008 .
I shall read out this amendment :
At that time we took a number of initiatives which we believed would help children , the most vulnerable section of our society .
We therefore object to the European Commission &apos;s proposals and stress the need to reverse this policy and take account of the specific reality of the Member States and their production needs .
Amendment No 11 underscores the threat of &apos; dialectification &apos; to languages left on the margins of the information society .
Crime has to be fought and it has to be fought very strongly .
Needless to say , possible military action cannot be ruled out then .
In fact , 24 hours ago , we were rejecting the 1996 discharge because the Court of Auditors could not guarantee the overall regularity of payments in the 1996 budget .
Mr President , I can only express the hope , as did the Commissioner , that by December we shall have a good level of cooperation between Commission , Council and Parliament to produce a good budget for 25 countries .
We have to denounce the rapes , murders , summary executions , arbitrary arrests and harassment as unacceptable .
We should like to see increased cooperation between the Member States on these issues with a view to developing a humane asylum policy , in accordance with the Geneva Convention , for the whole of Europe .
Over @-@ exploitation is so severe in Community fisheries that the scientific authorities have recommended rapid reductions of the exploitation levels of up to 40 percent .
On the contrary , they must press the national governments to increase the financial appropriation for research in their budgets and thus improve working conditions in the area , as regards both the possible development of human resources in the public sector and the promotion of private investment and public @-@ private partnerships .
However , the current 10 % limit of Community financial support has proved insufficient to overcome the barriers to deployment at a trans @-@ European level .
As Vice @-@ Chairman of EuroLat , I would like to speak on the environment , and water issues in particular .
I hope it will mean the rejection of a policy that repaid terror with terror and crime with crime , one that , ultimately , rode roughshod over international law .
Secondly , I feel even more strongly that it is a question of passenger safety and , at least now that so much is heard about airline companies , we must bear in mind the safety of thousands of people who travel both in Europe and elsewhere .
This proposal is an extension and an evolution of the existing one from 1996 .
There are certainly many people who believe that qualified majority voting and codecision procedures should be used to tackle immigration issues .
One current idea is precisely to have ways of measuring progress and to monitor progress in certain areas on the basis of indicators .
Mr President , I am very happy that we are having this debate this evening , which follows on from the previous debate on a similar matter .
We wish to point out that , in the report , subsidies for withdrawing large vessels from the tuna fleet are described , and rightly so , as counterproductive and catastrophic , which is why it proposes that they be abolished and redirected towards renewing the fleet .
Dutch pigs spend 30 to 40 hours being transported to Spain and Italy ; Irish sheep travel to Greece and even the Middle East .
Part two is interoperability , in other words , that transport can take place between countries with different systems . Part three is still to come .
The word would be &apos; transitional &apos; , and the amendment would then read as follows : &apos; except for temporary , transitional derogations &apos; .
The High Representative said during his last appearance that , surely , on the basis of the Mitchell and Tenet plans , what we had to do was speed up and create a Palestinian State .
Renewable energy uses resources that will never run out and that many developing countries have in abundance : sun and wind mainly .
As the Commissioner , with whom I am in complete agreement , said just now , we must first examine what the environmental situation in the region was , but we must also ascertain , with great care of course , the relationship of cause and effect between the equipment used - the weapons - and the impact on health .
Corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
I am convinced that the European Parliament resolution on this subject will be a significant milestone in understanding the role and importance of accessibility in the inclusive information society .
I also found important the fact that it pays particular attention to the mobility of students , academics , researchers and businessmen by ensuring that sufficient resources are available and by strengthening existing scholarship programmes .
In order to make up the backlog , and we acknowledge that it is a huge problem , obsolete contracts and appropriations will be scrapped .
This would lead to further fragmentation and disunity in the internal market for food , and would completely nullify the main aim of the regulation , which is to have unified and clear food labelling .
.
We therefore hope that Parliament will throw its full weight behind the initiatives that the Commission provides and we also hope that the commitments made a few weeks ago will be fully honoured , even if this procedure cannot be wound up by Christmas but under the new procedure introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon .
Normally , Members put requests to speak in writing to ensure that they appear on the list .
As a result of the analysis , the pipeline will be laid in the seabed with a covering of half a metre for about 20 km .
There are six amendments to this resolution , all of which were tabled by my colleague Didier Rod , which we agree with and are going to support , and we are only going to leave voting free on Amendment No 5 , which aims to introduce a new paragraph 14a .
Most of the time complaints are filed without being followed up by the police .
The ten new countries can become members from 1 May 2004 .
Nothing could be more common in our everyday lives than a mobile phone , a television set or the ability to communicate .
Unfortunately , however , I have to say that I take a rather less optimistic view than him of the compromise on registration we have before us .
It is obvious from the debate here that we could in fact have constructed a resolution on a wide range of issues on which we agree .
I put to the vote the request for referral back to committee .
Item 13 : We welcome increased European cooperation between the national coastguard services when it comes to joint operations , planning and the development of competence .
The Commission ’ s proposed thematic strategy and proposal for a directive on better air quality are therefore a disappointment .
This will instead create pronounced political pessimism and will impact on public opinion regarding the European Union as an institution , with all the attendant consequences for Parliament , too , in political terms in the new Member States .
Mr President , I too should like to thank the rapporteur for her hard work .
These are the only recipes for safeguarding sustainable employment in the long term .
I believe that forum will be created after you have held that meeting here is Strasbourg .
We cannot leave nuclear power stations as they are , but we must also trust technical procedures which are currently available to us and which probably will continue making progress to eliminate waste .
Perhaps he would clarify one point for me .
in writing . - ( PT ) Atul Khare , the UN Under @-@ Secretary General responsible for peacekeeping operations , informed the United Nations Security Council that from 30 July to 4 August , over 500 people were victims of gang rape perpetrated in the North Kivu province by the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda ( FDLR ) , a Hutu rebel group , and by the Mai Mai militia .
Europe can only protect itself through the law , using sanctions and prosecutions .
But we must be realistic , and we are clearly not yet on that level at the present time , because we do not have a foundation of shared values - human rights , fair treatment of minorities , rejection of the death penalty - on which a genuine strategic partnership could be built .
Instead , it blocks any possible way forward .
The next item is the debate on the report ( A5 @-@ 0093 / 1999 ) by Mr Savary , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , on the proposal for a Council decision modifying Decision 97 / 787 / EC granting exceptional financial assistance to Armenia and Georgia in order to extend it to Tajikistan &#91; COM ( 1999 ) 391 - C5 ­ 0171 / 1999 - 1999 / 0172 ( CNS ) &#93; .
The whole idea is based on a very partial economic analysis and does not take account of the fact that tax revenue translates into increased demand .
Laughter
As regards Iraq , there is great concern about instability , indiscriminate violence , terrorist attacks and hostage @-@ taking , all of which claim countless victims , given the difficulties that have come to light in establishing security and the conditions
This is a new principle and an important contribution to the simplification of procedure , an important step in cutting red tape , and I am confident that the Commission will ensure that detailed inquiries will always find the relevant , competent consultant .
Mr President , the Kremlin is using energy supplies as a political instrument in conjunction with the principle of &apos; divide and rule &apos; in order to corrupt Europe country by country , from Cyprus to the Netherlands .
I believe that what Mrs Doyle has said is totally unacceptable and that it has nothing to do with what is happening here .
Mr President , Mr Duisenberg , we in Sweden are relatively new to the EU , and I am new to this House .
Mr Cashman &apos;s suggestions concerning the evaluation report , due to be presented by the Commission early in 2004 will also be borne in mind .
As she acknowledges , the European Union has a particular and important role to play : as a major donor of aid , as the biggest donor of humanitarian aid in the world and as the biggest trading block in the world .
Could the Commission please detail the current situation of its assistance to the reconstruction of Iraq ?
( NL ) Madam President , I am not sure what to make of this citizens &apos; initiative .
Nonetheless , the report hands out rather too much good advice for my liking .
EU position for the next special session of the UN General Assembly on Children
By signing this Treaty in December last year the Member States committed themselves to do everything in their power so that the text they signed will also be ratified in line with their internal rules , constitutional and other legal provisions .
We need competition if there is the least unemployment , for a smooth @-@ running healthcare system , for social justice , for high social standards , and , of course , we also need - these are competition criteria to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve highest @-@ quality products , equal market access conditions for all enterprises , and environmentally @-@ friendly products .
And the most important feature of the report is that it indicates , for each programme , who is responsible for co @-@ ordinating that programme .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , we are naturally delighted at the entry into force , on 15 March last , of Regulation No 258 / 97 on novel foods and novel food ingredients introducing new provisions covering appropriate labelling .
The Hungarian Presidency of the European Council is also deeply committed to this objective .
That is not exactly the sort of exchange and free movement associated with interoperability of the trans @-@ European high @-@ speed rail system .
It has destroyed production and trade channels and at the same time reinforced the links between Saddam Hussein and his people .
However , I cannot avoid sharing with you the feeling that this unique institutional instrument is not always effective , or at least not as much as it could be or it should be .
It does not have to return to a policy of interference , but must simply not give in to the temptation of indifference .
Furthermore , the possibility of suspending application of the directives cannot be left to the discretion of the individual Member States - in particular , since matters concerning the free movement of goods and capital do not fall within their sphere of competence .
The situation must be used to show that transatlantic cooperation can produce results .
Secondly , Commissioner , you said that we have obligations to the United States .
Thank God , however , this liberal and proactive policy has borne fruit .
Exploiting people &apos;s potential lack of memory that such evidence was not produced then does not make it evidence today .
I think the level of public investment at present in the Union is totally insufficient to improve European competitiveness .
The good news for us is that the United States , which in the past was always very sceptical of regulations that it had not passed itself , is increasingly open to international cooperation on regulatory issues , especially with us .
I can tell you that we are not unaware of the fact that the Prime Minister of Spanish Catalonia was one of the first people to launch the movement in favour of constitutional regions .
Before the final introduction of the ban , we should assess the state of implementation of the directive , as an assessment of this kind could lead to proposals for transitional solutions for the gradual withdrawal of unenriched cages without putting producers who have already complied with the regulations at a disadvantage .
It has to be more effective and we recognise that shortcoming .
The Member States and the Community need to combine their strength to prevent disasters and their impacts and to ensure a rapid and effective European response to major disasters .
Dumping is unfair competition , whether that is because the dumping companies receive state support or whether they use child labour to keep wages down .
I voted in favour of the report on waste electrical and electronic equipment because it presents proposals that should contribute to reducing administrative charges and strengthen the protection of the environment and human health by preventing or reducing the adverse effects resulting from the management of waste electrical and electronic equipment , with benefits for society .
Moreover , she repeated the European Union &apos;s position on the matter in order to dispel any misunderstanding of what had been said during the discussion in question .
We did not succeed in that , but it does not matter .
How can we get out of this deadlock now ?
I know that many of the complaints you receive do not fall within your remit , but this serves yet again to prove the point that citizens simply do not know where to turn when they run into administrative and other difficulties .
I would ask that a clear message be sent to the Council of Europe .
I find the idea very appealing , and I am trying to see how we could contribute to such a scheme through the European Development Fund .
Mr President , firstly I wish to express my satisfaction with the fact that the entire budget has been tightened up and the increase in appropriations amounts to 1.07 % of total GNP for the Member States , while the corresponding figure in the budget for 2000 was 1.11 % .
How is a small island of 4.4 million people supposed to cope with this madness ?
I am consequently very pleased that , in the resolution adopted by the European Parliament , we were considering arranging for a European Civil Protection Corps to be put in place , with the task of putting together another form of aid , free from the ulterior motives described and , especially , from the competition we have witnessed in the charitable and emergency relief stakes .
We have deliberately refrained from making any reference to natural , environmental , or technological disasters .
The two directives are being dealt with and adopted in parallel .
To my mind , then , as far as Europe &apos;s regions are concerned , this freedom in aviation matters will help strong areas to progress , but weaken those which are not so strong .
This is a decisive moment before enlargement , when we are able not only to express our positions on the work that the Convention has completed , but also to offer proposals .
It is true , as stated by the rapporteur , that &apos; the reconciliation by mothers and fathers of professional life and family life is a key factor in a modern family policy &apos; . This same concern can be detected in paragraph 14 .
This is , I think , an important point .
It sets a very dangerous precedent .
Even the New York Times printed the prophetic saying by Ezra Pound that &apos; with usura hath no man a house of good stone &apos; .
This is why it is frequently said with regard to structural reforms that labour markets must be reformed and that they need to be more flexible .
Perhaps colleagues will bear with me if I just set out why that is so critical .
If we cannot stop the violence , we cannot return the displaced people and refugees to their villages .
We shall have to tend and fertilise it very well until its trunk attains the same girth as the first pillar .
In other words , and in all sincerity , this is neither one thing nor the other .
Why not write them into certain dates ?
Mr Martin , I can tell you that this is a clear and unequivocal position .
We are extremely critical of parts of the EU &apos;s fisheries policy on environmental grounds .
Firstly , it stresses the importance for the European Union to protect the quality of products and makes this a major priority of the European agricultural strategy .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start my comments on Mr Desama &apos;s report on Europe and space by thanking and congratulating him for the enormous amount of work he has put into this within the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy .
As an evangelical Christian , it has become apparent to me , particularly over recent years , that the expression of Christian beliefs is largely deemed unacceptable in a society that wants us sanitised of any strongly held belief and where we must all believe the same or believe nothing .
Close cooperation between the European Union and the Council of Europe is another asset in our fight against the death penalty .
Another issue that has been raised is whether the countries can refuse to receive nuclear waste they do not want . Of course , provided that it is not their own .
Today , we must call on all the parties contesting the election , particularly the majority in power , to demonstrate that this country is able to achieve its ambition : to hold free and transparent elections , in which every citizen , using his single ballot paper , can choose the candidates that will run the country in future .
The Regulation will enable us to avoid repetition of the many errors committed in the past , which have caused damage to the environment and to public health .
One can ask if the EU was fully prepared for that .
Producers in those countries destroyed their harvest , whilst they pocketed the subsidies for the crops .
It must be efficient , and for this reason we want to maintain Parliament &apos;s scope for negotiation , so that we and the Commission and the Council can together agree on what the best possible form of governance is to see this European and very ambitious , major project through to the end .
The proposal creates environmental economic accounts as satellite accounts to ESA 95 by providing methodology , common standards , definitions , classifications and accounting rules , intended to be used for compiling environmental economic accounts .
Most governments can hope to contribute to economic growth only by clearing the decks of obstacles and creating an enterprise @-@ free environment .
It is for this reason that I welcome the resolution whilst emphasising the fact that the EU should seek to be in good relations with Iran as it is a potentially important partner for the EU .
I ask you now , Mr President of the European Council : &apos; Where are the courtly gallantries ?
In spite of the high degree of confidence that we have in the Commission , we cannot regard simply having a future exchange of letters as satisfactory .
Hence we have the European Court &apos;s embargo on British beef .
I think that it is absolutely right that today there should be no large line @-@ up of Members here concerned about health , rather than producers .
Turkey has been receiving billions of euros of structural money for years .
It does not deal in detail with issues related to investment , research and development , training and education .
The rigorous order which the Taliban have imposed restricts the fundamental rights of women and tends to make them second @-@ class citizens .
Mr Tavares prepared an excellent report and we see no proposals from the Council to contradict the model resettlement programme that has been designed .
Fourthly , competition should mean a true and wider choice among quality products and services , reaching the broadest possible spread of consumers .
It does not make sense to create new institutions if they are not underpinned by common convictions , and if a common political will is lacking .
It is important for the EU to respect the right of self @-@ determination of these people without any restrictions and to recognise the results of the referendum as an expression of the democratic will of the people of South Sudan .
I do not understand it at all and I still do not know whether or not the presidency will support our demands .
The new Sharia legal system in Nigeria needs to be reformed .
Let me conclude with a couple of observations on the role played by the other groups in this House .
But then the cuts will come , as always .
The alternative is a morass of unequal bilateral deals which will in the main disadvantage the developing world , we are already seeing this trend worsening .
If we take these two reports together they clearly represent a flaw in the thinking of European politicians , namely that whatever the problem appears to be , Europe is the solution .
The period of notice required from employees who have resigned and trial periods are going to be extended , which means that employment contracts can be terminated without notice during or at the end of this period , during which more than three people can be employed in succession for the same position .
( Applause )
2 .
Today , the fifteen Member States are split into two camps : those which have employment and , under the pressure of competition , work longer and longer and harder and harder ; and those which , rejected by the employment market , endure longer and longer periods of unemployment .
In the case of information technology , however , we start with a totally different set of coordinates .
Mr President , together with honourable Members , the Commission deplores the increasing number of victims generated by the clashes between Maoists and government forces in Nepal .
Moreover , we are also vehemently opposed to the development of new ways of providing the EU with its own resources , because we do not wish to impose any additional burdens on the people of Europe .
The tax burden per annum dependent on the emission of pollutants must increase in line with any increase in it .
Mr President , let us render unto Caesar the things which be Caesar &apos;s and unto God the things which be God &apos;s .
How much confidence can we show in you ?
Member of the Commission . - ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , in my first reply dealing with the Directives on non @-@ discrimination I mentioned a study drafted within the framework of a process for the assessment of implementation and effectiveness , which examines whether and how it would be suitable to amend the relevant European legislation .
We are certain that they will fight to overturn these policies .
I believe we need a resolution in order to define Parliament &apos;s position on a war that is going to destroy a nation .
Despite the fact that it was clear six years ago to all of those involved in the investigation that action had to be taken , none of the actual perpetrators , nor their accomplices , were brought to justice , and their activities continued undisturbed .
We therefore urgently require a moratorium so that no further nuclear plants will be built , and we need to establish a timetable for closing the 143 plants that currently exist in Europe .
The idea of a shared European history can be at best only a compromise .
Mr President , it is said that the EU project has no greater ambition than to see the destruction of nation states and to have unwanted and unrealistic federal fantasies imposed upon them .
The markets have said so , which is why our currency has devalued by 30 % , and soon the voters , too , will get their chance to say so .
France will soon take over the EU Presidency , and a review of the EU budget is overdue .
I fully agree with Mr Watson that there is ample evidence that reforms work .
A further area that the committee has taken on board is the whole issue of driver safety .
This should not be the case .
Progress in implementing the Framework Agreement is steady .
This is why , despite the progress that has been made in the fight against this type of violence at national level , we are still systematically dealing with this scourge , which is often only the tip of the iceberg , because only a small percentage of the violence that actually occurs is reported , so it continues to exist .
Let us be completely clear about it .
We as a Community must act together and I am delighted to hear the President @-@ inOffice say that the Troika is currently looking at the situation .
With accountability hopefully becoming clearer , we can also increase efficiency , as at present , for example , delays in making payments in the Commission are too long and do not in any way match the sort of efficiency we see in the world of business .
I would like to thank the whole team that negotiated on Parliament &apos;s side , as well as their staff , for helping us to find the solution , and all Members , especially the rapporteurs of the Committee on Budgets , for helping us to achieve this package .
Mr Zapatero cannot shake the hand of a leader such as Mr Chávez , who is turning Venezuela into a haven for terrorists .
Whilst gender equality and consideration for the needs of disabled people are very laudable objectives , the defence of &apos; people potentially exposed to discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin , religion or beliefs , disability , age and sexual orientation &apos; may be a way of silencing opposition to the immigration policy currently being pursued by the Member States , which has been threatening our social protection systems for 30 years .
Closure of the sitting
I mentioned earlier that we will establish a Members hotline .
Another European country has yet again had to come up with a new national budget , and for our friends across the Irish Sea , it is an extremely difficult time .
A large number of family businesses involved in fishing and fish processing have closed down .
All its sittings are in public and comprehensible - I wish the Council &apos;s were - and the speed with which we are capable of reaching decisions - on the European arrest warrant for example - leads me to the conclusion that we are more efficient than the Council and , in many ways , even more so than the Commission .
o
In the first place , there is no cross @-@ border aspect to the proposal and , secondly , this matter has already been regulated in the majority of Member States , including Denmark , through cooperation agreements .
( SV ) Madam President , we really do live in a wasteful society if we regard this as waste .
As guardian of the Treaty , the Commission will examine all complaints that it receives .
In reply to the rapporteur &apos;s question , the revision of conformity assessment procedures , which has been agreed upon in the joint declaration and in Amendment No 32 , also includes harmonisation of the definitions of specific terms used in certification , such as &apos; manufacturer &apos; , &apos; authorised representative &apos; , &apos; trader &apos; , etc .
I welcome the overall approach , which includes targets for recovery of each of the stocks , total allowable catches allowing for an annual percentage increase of 30 % for cod and 15 % for hake , with an upper and lower limit to the permitted change in the TAC of 50 % from one year to the next , a system of fishing effort limitation , enhanced controls in relation to satellite tracking for vessels over 50 metres in length , position reporting , landing conditions , retentions on board and conditions for weighing and transport . The potential use of temporary closed areas for up to 60 days .
The mealy @-@ mouthed and abortive reform , the accounting system ’ s obsolescence and vulnerability to fraud and the Eurostat affair are just three examples that speak volumes .
Europe will be greater and more powerful at a relatively low price .
I am in agreement , but this must not open the door to languages which are not fully legal being used in Parliament .
They have now vetoed more than a third of the laws adopted by the parliament .
In this case , the authorities acted rapidly and correctly , so the Commission would not consider it a reason to impose sanctions .
We are not favourably inclined , either , to the comment that this assistance is exceptional and will not set a precedent for the future .
Perhaps we talk about it too optimistically .
The numerous international conventions have shown that they can only partially deal with the problems related to adoption .
These measures will be instrumental in wiping out the stigmas caused by the contaminated blood crisis and Creutzfeldt @-@ Jakob disease in France and in Europe .
That is why we had the idea of seeking this one @-@ year extension so that they could be synchronised .
With the opponents losing ground under fire from Gaddafi &apos;s troops and mercenaries , and the Colonel sending emissaries to European capitals in an attempt to save his regime , we need to show the Libyan people that we stand by them .
More specifically , it is about the common fight against cross @-@ border crime , particularly in terms of making arrangements regarding minimum maximum penalties to be included in the legislation of the Member States .
The price that we pay for this is to have more unstable economies .
Sensitive personal data on citizens of the European Union can be transferred to the authorities in the United States , with no guarantees whatsoever , and our citizens are clearly concerned about this .
In my country , antidrugs discos , as they are called , are now part of the scene .
Joking apart , I believe that the people of Europe who are following this debate are quite right to ask whether we in this House do not have more important things to do . We should leave things where they belong .
The gentlemen of the Presidency were present for the previous topic .
We are ready to take account of the specifics and the needs of the sporting sector , such as security , which is inseparable from this type of organization .
We are still awaiting this Commission proposal , in line with Directive 97 / 67 / EC , which means that the articles relating to liberalisation of the previous directive may no longer apply .
The Council is also prepared for a solution where payment appropriations may be cut by EUR 2 billion by combining compulsory and non @-@ compulsory expenditure .
Mr President , the Berlin European Council limited the interim review of Agenda 2000 - and the two own @-@ initiative reports referred specifically to the Commission &apos;s future proposals on the review of Agenda 2000 - in terms of the limits on the financial perspectives and the possible review of the intervention prices for cereals and milk quotas .
Are you going to ensure that the minutes are made public and that conflicts of interest are avoided ?
I hope that this could have an impact on other , related sectors , such as plant protection product data requirements , which are right now moving through their own revision process .
In short , we want to condemn the alleged infringements of fundamental political rights , but without going to the extreme of placing the Government of Nicaragua in a difficult situation , so that it can go on performing its role of supporting the most deprived strata of its society .
The new countries will thus be teaching the old countries .
Madam President , I should like to begin by saying that in our view the principles of subsidiarity model and characterise the decision @-@ making process of the Community &apos;s institutions .
I am sure he does not need any prompting from any Commissioner to ask in Parliament what he wishes to know .
It rejects the proposed solutions on both language and the jurisdictional system because they do not achieve the cost reductions and simplification of the patent system that industry is calling for .
For us , it is very important to show Lebanon that now , the first steps towards a democratic process must be consolidated by elections .
There are loans from the European Social Fund and the RETEX programme , but these are not real solutions .
In recent years , as a result of European policies and the policies of successive governments , we have lost 6,000 direct jobs in the steel industry , 6,000 direct jobs in mining , 10,000 small agricultural businesses , we have lost jobs in the arms industry and we have lost jobs in the shipbuilding industry .
Renewable energy sources for electricity generation , fuel production and for heating and cooling are all given a high profile in the Commission &apos;s proposal for the Seventh Framework Programme , within the broader portfolio approach mentioned earlier .
As the shadow rapporteur on the Visa Information System , that is also the approach I want to take .
These include lifelong learning , public spending and private investment in education , school drop @-@ out rates , which are already too high at secondary school level , and the relevance of education compared with the job market .
All of these states were affected last year by powerful floods , as a result of torrential rain which caused landslides and substantial loss of human life , as well as damage to residential buildings , businesses , farming areas , the road and rail networks and other infrastructure .
It is not that simple , but I will try my hand at it in any case .
The best conclusion for this 2005 draft budget would be for the three institutions to be moderately satisfied with the final result .
Law @-@ making is like angling .
The outcome of the Nice Summit puts people off , unfortunately .
Currently , 20 % of the world &apos;s population is at the reproductive stage of their lives and it is therefore crucial that information on their sexuality and their reproductive capacity is available , in order to ensure that that population is protected from unwanted pregnancies and sexually @-@ transmitted diseases .
I trust that Parliament will support the extension of the Initiative beyond 2004 , in line with its current legislative framework .
With regard to the third priority – growth – we need to speed up our progress towards the Lisbon objectives .
Mr President , I wanted to draw this House ’ s attention to an event that is stirring up feeling in the hearts and minds of Italians .
Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for his comments , but I did not hear him say that the report contains a number of excellent recommendations across a broad spectrum , which he intends to adopt .
But more Europe , to them , does not mean what a lot of us inside this room might think .
Lastly I would like to mention visa arrangements .
The courts were obliged to set at liberty a German of Syrian origin who was suspected of involvement in the terrorist attack in Madrid .
Rather than perpetuating the fragmentation that is already widespread , there may quite probably – as my colleagues have already pointed out – be some simplification and tightening @-@ up , not to mention greater legal certainty .
We have also been able , as individuals , to access information , evidence and analysis when necessary .
Rural development and market organisation programmes form part of this objective , as do school meals .
In many Member States - for example , the United Kingdom , Italy , Ireland and Luxembourg - the limit on the amount of alcohol that anyone driving a vehicle may have in their blood has been set at 0.8 mg / l . In Slovakia and Hungary , which do not allow anyone who has consumed even the smallest amount of alcohol to drive , any driver with that amount of alcohol in their blood would be committing a serious offence .
So you are quite right , on the one hand the Finance Ministers are of course pleased if money flows back into their coffers in any given budget year , but on the other hand it is those very same Finance Ministers who prepare forecasts about how much is drawn down from the structural funds in any year .
I am voting for this proposal , as I agree with the rapporteur when she says that union is strength .
The European Union and national governments support the principle of subsidiarity which guarantees that decision @-@ making incorporates a local input at every opportunity .
The big question is whether this is the best procedure for adopting the budget .
This is a really important issue which goes to the whole heart of why we have the European Union .
Our main objective has been to respond to the great challenges faced by our science , technology and innovation in order to reduce the gap separating us from our competitors .
This is a vital aspect if we remember that many citizens reside in a different Member State to the one in which they were born or the decision on maintenance obligations was made .
The third point is that we must strive to have more than a minimalist cohesion policy and reinvent a policy which applies to all the territories of the Union that are experiencing difficulties .
The text as adopted today , whilst satisfactory in certain respects - especially in relation to the fight against discrimination against disabled people - the vague concepts it contains , the legal uncertainties that it maintains and the superfluous requirements that it introduces make it legally impractical and therefore ineffective in its application .
Mr President , I am very surprised at the order of voting here .
This is all stupid and ridiculous .
In his speech , Mr Rod suggested that we have not been engaging in proper consultation , but the fact is that by doing what we are doing , we are , in fact , ensuring that consultation takes place .
Product promotion is a good thing , provided that the product concerned is available .
The debate is closed .
You know the story - the dogs bark and the caravan moves on .
The famous social mainstreaming clause setting out the Union &apos;s obligation to ensure that its every policy promotes the objectives of high employment , environmental protection , public health , education and equality between men and women can only be applied under good laws .
The directive in question is directed at this aim , since it has attempted to stress good practices that can be disseminated , as well as all the infrastructure and knowledge that can contribute to the long @-@ term prevention and the short @-@ term forecasting of floods , with a view to providing significant assistance to civil protection bodies in the management of emergencies .
Añoveros Trías de Bés report
I call on the Commission to take this initiative .
We also need to strengthen its efficiency by looking into how we can convince Member States to honour the promises they made when they committed themselves to providing equipment for FRONTEX missions .
There was very efficient cooperation between all the components of the budgetary authority .
Personally , I will be delighted if the aims of this directive are well implemented .
Mr President , I would like to speak about the latest discrimination affecting new Member States .
However , regulating and enforcing these agreements will prove a challenge .
I think it is a good tradition that the President of the Council of Ministers always takes the trouble to attend when we hold important debates on agriculture .
This is even more important given that Turkey is a candidate for accession to the EU with significant shortcomings in the areas of the administration of justice , the penal system , the protection of minorities and religious freedom , even if a biased report from an allegedly independent Commission or the Ahtisaari report give a different impression .
Unfortunately , it did not attract majority support in the main reporting committee , the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy .
This is not what has happened here .
The European Union will continue to make full use of that Committee to propose both thematic and country resolutions .
I also call on the Council Presidency to make a similar statement to our resolution on this occasion and also in June on the occasion of the Tiananmen Square massacre .
All things considered , the new transatlantic marketplace could serve to safeguard consumer interests , given the stated aim of eliminating by 2010 all existing tariffs on industrial goods , thanks to new agreements negotiated on the basis of mutual recognition , the so @-@ called MRAs .
People are sent out without being properly briefed , knowing the background or talking the official language .
This morning , a video conference conciliation meeting took place with the Council for the first time , and we managed to reach agreement on the Solidarity Fund live on screen .
Now the question is whether all the institutions , within the framework of their own responsibility , will put this principle into practice and whether the Commission will actually make proposals for acts on these issues .
We have not succeeded in deciding where to locate the Food Agency , however , because the right of veto has been used .
Quite the reverse , in fact .
As in employment strategy , there are four thematic areas : employability , entrepreneurship , adaptability and equal opportunities , and we agree that those thematic areas should be enlarged in line with the European Parliament &apos; s proposals .
The package is important because of the need for a clear and harmonised approach on the current system of cabotage instead of different approaches in the various Member States and also access to the market for transport operators .
Well , the extra @-@ judicial executions are continuing , most recently of Abdel Aziz Rantisi .
A week ago to the day , the Belarusian President Lukashenko highlighted this chasm by issuing a decree to legitimise and consolidate his authoritarian presidency via the ballot box even after 2006 .
Wherever we can lend support we should do so .
( LT ) Over the last two decades , the travel market has developed in a very dynamic manner .
We must face up to the human rights abuses in the EU .
Without such a federal budget the imbalances across the Union &apos;s territory might well worsen , especially when we note the so @-@ called asymmetrical shocks which will effect certain countries and regions more than others .
On 23 January , Mr Amin , who is the coordinator of the Maghreb Coordination of Human Rights Organisations , was refused entry into Tunisia .
This inconsistency will become even more noticeable the more the evolution of EMU progresses .
If the European Union decides to take such a step , it will risk becoming a laughing @-@ stock and will demonstrate that , sooner or later , it will legitimise every action taken by Russia , even the most dangerous .
– Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , as we know , terrorist action over recent years has targeted public transport – trains , buses , aeroplanes , ships and the areas in which they operate .
It is reckoned that it would cost at least EUR 100 million for the elimination of the problem I described earlier , and that is why , in our judgment , it is probably more helpful to turn to the global environmental facility in order to secure an objective which the honourable Member is quite right to highlight .
In any event , adopting this directive in accordance with the Conciliation Committee &apos;s joint text will be a good start .
We share your view that the continued pursuit of the Barcelona process is of vital importance to the whole region .
For this reason , I am most surprised that the Council has not approved the very proposals that were designed to &apos; green &apos; the budget , and the Committee on Budgets is therefore retabling five amendments relating to the environment aspects of the Structural Funds , environmental protection and the allocation of Structural Fund money to environmental protection under the habitats and birds directives .
In conclusion , Mr. President , I think that Mr. Mavromatis &apos; report proves that , at a European level , we need a coherent policy and concrete actions in order to turn to good account and make sport more efficient and I hope we will see more initiatives in this respect .
That has now been achieved .
I think this is a less bureaucratic approach and is a policy throughout the Union , and the Member States that have invested in energy efficiency are gaining more and have more possibilities to achieve something in the energy efficiency field .
It is clear that this programme does not make for the creation of a genuinely social Europe , but will instead pose a threat to the present European social model .
While these mark an important first step , the ultimate goal must be to liberalise travel for all citizens of the region .
When President Bush signed it , his advisers looked back and said , &apos; my God , China has signed it !
We also objected to that and changed it .
Secondly , I wish to complain about the fact that written declarations are very , very difficult to sign in our Parliament .
Today &apos;s vote brings to 26 the number of Member States whose parliaments have backed the Treaty .
We condemn just as vigorously the assassination of the French journalist Jean Hélène , and we ask that an international inquiry be set up in order to bring those responsible to justice .
In many ways , you represented an exemplary Presidency .
If the result is confirmed by this House as a whole , it will represent a further significant step towards greater transparency and safety in the production of feedingstuffs .
As a fellow Member said recently , Europe was absent .
Europe now needs to get involved in resolving the conflict in Iraq .
Looking at the Intergovernmental Conference - and repeated references have been made to it - everyone regards the enlargement as ethically necessary .
I can illustrate this with the example of the Czech Republic , which during the 1990s cut annual production from over one million tonnes of sugar to 435 000 tonnes .
I say &apos; brave proposal &apos; , because it is a sector which has a clear structure with the producer organisations and operational programmes and the main issue raised is that of decoupling .
I would ask the Commissioner to look sympathetically at that side of the argument as well .
But this House must be realistic .
Question 34 has been withdrawn and Questions 33 and 35 to 44 will be answered in writing .
Over the past few years we have witnessed China showing a great interest in Africa and carrying out an expansive policy of investment there .
We have to act and to protect ourselves .
Although I understand the EU strategy of striking a balance between a neighbourhood policy for continental Europe and a Mediterranean strategy , it seems to me that we should be setting priorities for a future European neighbourhood policy , as otherwise our ability to implement and finance it could be undermined .
We have declared 14 September 2001 a day of mourning in the 15 Member States .
These requirements also have an impact on safety .
Moreover , given the extent of exclusion , the overall inclusion of Roma is essentially an issue of human rights .
At that time I was ashamed to read that the European Union , together with the US Government , was one of the few sources of support left to the President who acted in such an irresponsible way , after having tried to appropriate the country ’ s scant natural resources .
However , if I may dwell on the importance of the Mediterranean to the European Union , it was high time that the European Council adopted a common strategy for that region .
Unlike Mrs McNally , I perceive , rather , a slight opening @-@ up on the part of the Americans , not least in the sphere of agriculture .
I was shocked by the publicity @-@ grabbing handshakes between Mr Primakov and Mgr Tauron , the Vatican envoy , with the criminal Milosevic , while thousands of Kosovars were being expelled from their homes and expatriated by force .
It is not only a technical report that we have before us ; it is also a highly political report - a report in which high political standards also had to be respected .
That is , I want to remind you of that point , a strategy for growth because growth - smart , inclusive sustainable growth - is the answer .
It represents progress compared to the past , where we had completely different institutions to deal with what is , in fact , a very important common interest - namely the defence of European values in the world .
Hence , in the United Kingdom I support Chancellor Gordon Brown ’ s calls for a willingness and for procedures to embrace Britishness . My third and final point is that with three million illegal immigrants in the EU , this issue has to be robustly tackled , not least because of its association with the odious practice of human trafficking .
We must have proper democratic control .
These are breaches which the democratic forces will seek to widen .
Your services have invested in the detail , in planning and in human resources .
There needs to be a system of public research into diseases that no longer exist in developed countries and are therefore no longer of interest to the pharmaceutical industry . Problems of distribution and medical culture must be resolved .
I am firmly convinced that the individual Member States believe that this matter , which affects hundreds of thousands , maybe even millions of European citizens , must be resolved quickly and appropriately .
That may be interesting , but there is nothing new about it .
I insist on this point : let us not target the wrong enemy .
The regional policy transport and tourism committee has already accepted an amendment to limit the period for any project to no more than 15 years and I would commend this to the House .
This should come as no surprise to you , Commissioner Patten , rather I assume that , naturally , you are familiar with Parliament &apos; s view of the matter .
It is no longer a technical matter confined to technocrats and has become as much a part of the CFSP as the remit of energy ministers .
&lt; empty &gt;
Commissioner , there are agreements between some of the candidate countries , such as the customs union agreement between the Czech Republic and Slovakia , rather than the Visegrad agreement , which could render the situation rather more complex should only one of the two countries join the Union , for example , if the Czech Republic were to join but not Slovakia or vice versa .
Moreover , under the Treaties , the Community institutions have no powers in military affairs .
The risk of desertification then increases hand over fist , particularly in Europe &apos;s Mediterranean regions .
Besides the annual evaluation programme , Article 7 of the regulation must take into account not only the risk analysis provided by FRONTEX but also the audits and inspections conducted by Member States themselves .
The rapporteur proposes that throughout the French text the term contrôle démocratique should be replaced by responsabilité démocratique .
I should like to thank the Commissioner and all the speakers in that debate .
( The President cut off the speaker )
On the other side , there are domestic issues which can very well be resolved in Germany , but this is not the place to bring them up .
Reports that require a qualified majority are usually voted on first .
Subject : Measures to ensure decent living conditions for illegal immigrants , particularly women and children
I should like to thank the Members who have done a great deal to enrich this report , which we drafted quickly , since we were informed of the communication in November .
The fact of employees participating in the process also leads to better restructuring .
The EU , which brought former enemies together for peaceful cooperation , is now being militarised .
This is where the figures start to get confusing .
I would like to ask directly how the President @-@ in @-@ Office views the Danish early retirement benefit in relation to Regulation No 1408 .
So we convert EUR 2 million to EUR 235 million .
But that is not the case here .
In view of the difficult negotiations and of the pending completion of the legislative procedure on the Galileo satellite navigation system , I strongly endorse the stipulation made by the rapporteur that the budget line created for expenditure on administrative management should be a pro memoria item .
The freedom to provide services or the freedom of establishment , the nationality of the employer , of employees or of posted workers cannot serve as a justification for inequalities concerning working conditions , pay or the exercise of fundamental rights such as the workers &apos; right to take collective action .
The report by Mrs Ayala Sender also , rightly , highlights the simplification of administrative procedures , infrastructure investment needs and the problems posed by logistics in urban areas .
It is a delight to have Mr Haarder with us again , in a different role .
Bernard @-@ Reymond report ( A4 @-@ 0479 / 98 )
Please do not let these announcements be the end of the matter .
Most Member States essentially supported the compromise decision under which three cabotage trips are permissible within seven days after unloading in the host Member State .
In this connection we eagerly await a special report from the Court of Auditors and in closing may I express my thanks to the latter for the position it has adopted , which is the subject of today &apos;s debate , and request that this report be passed on to us as quickly as possible .
I am convinced that our proposal provides the common language and the means to develop the necessary mutual trust , which is the basis for real implementation of such an instrument .
This is not stating anything new , but these are the issues .
The message , as far as reforming the Employment Strategy is concerned , is that we cannot insist on reforms relating to the labour market and to the modernisation of social systems and to another set of policies relating to the employment strategy .
You may be able to lift it and go down in history with it , or you may fail completely .
You know that King Hassan II has announced a package of measures concerning reform of the constitution with the object of bringing the Moroccan democratic system up to a level which most of you would regard as appropriate .
I would like to say that in recent years my staff - whom I thank again for their work - have already begun to reflect on the Marco Polo programme beyond 2013 , and that this assessment will focus , among other things , on the points set out in the compromise agreement .
Today we are examining the report by Mr Schulz - whom I thank for his work and efforts - on the aide @-@ mémoire on the European Union &apos;s contribution to reinforcing the prevention of the sexual abuse and exploitation of children and on the Commission communication on combating child sex tourism .
For these reasons , we reject the Commission proposal and support Mr Linkohr &apos;s report , acknowledging the efforts made by the rapporteur .
The proposed Agency will be yet another bureaucratic body .
That is what will happen in the immediate future .
I must of course , say , however , that , in general terms , I have the feeling that the basic elements of the issues , the objectives and the hopes that we , the various institutions and Europe &apos; s citizens in general share are or can , quite reasonably , be promoted for the future , when it comes to putting our ideas and our plans into practice .
This report is badly drafted and detracts from the main issue before the House today which is &apos; Making Poverty History &apos; .
Everyone has the right to worship freely and I therefore call for all religious communities in Turkey to be recognised .
I believe that the issues that have been touched on here - aircraft noise , street noise , railway noise - can be tackled by a variety of methods , that it is essential to set noise limits for tools and machinery , and that we need to make more progress in research .
On this subject , the proposals of both the Commission and the Plooij @-@ Van Gorsel report lead me to make a few observations .
The EIB will no longer be able to count on the support of a few trustworthy Members in the future .
This was no chance happening , since we were preparing the ground for the next ministerial meeting and for the Spanish Presidency itself and this desire was asserted once again at the Barcelona European Council , but in a much more low @-@ key way .
People do not want to be presented with an array of competing post offices marketing their products .
In fact , tourism already accounts directly and indirectly for more than 10 % of gross domestic product in the European Union and provides around 12 % of jobs .
I also congratulate him on ensuring that this matter is dealt with at the highest level during the presidency .
In addition , within the scientific community there is a perception that the Directorate @-@ General appears to have opted to prioritise basic research without making room for research focused on public policies .
- A5 @-@ 0373 / 2003 by Mr Di Lello Finuoli , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ’ Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , on the proposal for a Council framework decision to strengthen the criminal law framework for the enforcement of the law against ship @-@ source pollution ( COM ( 2003 ) 227 – C5 @-@ 0244 / 2003 – 2003 / 0088 ( CNS ) ) .
When one asks for change one must also know how far one can go .
Thank you very much for inviting me .
The term appears in all European Union documents , government documents and , more importantly , in the documents of those who wish to destroy sustainable development and foster unsustainable development and a model of consumption that is going to prevent us from leaving Johannesburg with clear priorities and mechanisms for action , although , of course , I hope to be proved wrong .
It is going to be impossible to maintain this sector .
It would certainly be helpful to improve the common structures and cooperation by way of a European Organ Donor Card , a joint organ donor pool and a transplant hotline .
Indeed , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy proposes to ban all terms such as light , ultralight or mild , since they are considered to be completely misleading for smokers , and eliminate any possibility of derogation for the States .
It is true that we did not manage to include control of working time in the scope of the new directive .
It will be difficult to progress matters in certain social or fiscal areas , but no more difficult than at present .
The science of climate change is incontrovertible .
We therefore need to promote Eurobonds .
Finally , it is also necessary to have stronger Community rules to combat the funding of terrorism .
In particular I appreciate your strong support for strengthening the urban dimension in future cohesion policy .
I wish the record to be changed , if possible .
Furthermore , the effort to wipe the anti @-@ Fascist victory from people &apos;s memories and to abolish its anniversary on 9 May is revelatory .
The diversity and quality of culture and the capacity to participate in cultural creation are elements of a democratic society that cannot be ignored .
I would , however , like to express my disenchantment with the fact that regulations still exist in the Community market that are out of line with the Posting of Workers Directive .
Perhaps he finds it more valuable to gather the opinions of all and sundry in the corridors of Parliament , which would perhaps explain the first proposals which he has put to us .
This is probably the last opportunity for European countries to show a clear determination to deal with these chances effectively .
We have a new process set up , but that vigilance is going to be important .
I believe it would also be appropriate to consider another issue that has been outstanding for some time .
There are crowds of people on minus 2 floor and it is absolutely impossible to get access to this plenary for 3 p.m. It is very inconvenient for visitors but it is desperately inconvenient for Members .
You have no doubt been in touch with the mayor of Strasbourg ; many of us have written to the Mayor of Strasbourg .
At the stage we are already at with this matter , we could have prevented this further blow to the way in which European integration is viewed .
thirdly , we consider that the position of the United States , calling for withdrawal of the regulation or indefinite suspension of its implementation , is totally unacceptable ;
Let me be very honest : as someone who flies every week , when I am up there at 39 000 feet , I want , above all , to be safe and secure , so I do not ever argue about security .
The Commission has always taken the line that there is no formal link between the CVM mechanism and Schengen accession .
It is a state with a rather complicated historical past - there is Trans @-@ Dniester , Gagauzia , Moldova and many other matters .
The situation in the Balkans , however , clearly demonstrates that EU policy offers no solution that would prevent the division of the state while providing for the peaceful coexistence of all the ethnic and religious entities within it .
Can the Council confirm the modification resulting from the amendment announced by Mr Lewandowski ?
Perhaps the Commission would be able to enlighten us at the end of this debate because it would help guide the way in which we would vote .
After all , the world ’ s leading exporter cannot be allowed to operate selfish protectionism .
This should also apply to military air traffic , which , particularly in France , is still able to occupy an unacceptably large part of the airspace .
Mr Rosado Fernandes , I did not hear the end of your speech .
However , you have raised a couple of issues .
That is what we hope for and is the cordial message that we are sending our governments , even if it goes against their interests .
Among the negative aspects , and despite the efforts of Baroness Ashton , is the different yardsticks against which the cases of Libya and Syria are measured in the United Nations Security Council and also in the Council of Ministers of the European Union .
We cannot ignore them , and within this framework each person must be able to familiarize himself rapidly with the new currency and use it comfortably and with confidence .
We welcome his independence from any pressure which might limit the fulfilment of the objectives set for the European Central Bank by the Maastricht Treaty .
I now turn to Parliament &apos;s budget .
That is the best form of prevention and the best form of protection .
Sport must be given the status it deserves in the Union , in a limited way , but so that sporting organizations and clubs are involved at the preparatory stage of legislation .
Today , the side to choose is quite clear : as my colleagues have said , it is the side of freedom , it is the voice of the people .
In this respect , the opportunity of the 50th anniversary that has just been mentioned should actually be taken to hold a democratic debate on the EU ’ s plans and projects to date , and thus also to enable a new start for the European Union .
This is very important because it will then become clear how many Members were present and , more importantly , how many have left .
We in Britain had that opportunity .
Now the EU has an obligation to tackle unemployment .
I think that is regrettable .
The Commission has actively reminded Member States of their obligations to respect Community law in this regard and I would refer to a number of contributions from Members of the House on this matter , and would draw your attention to the fact that there is legislation in place relating to this issue which must be complied with by Member States .
I am not suggesting that we need to jettison the sustainability of resources in favour of the sector ’ s economic viability , because that would lead to the collapse of environmental sustainability and of these fishermen ’ s future .
What value , for example , are telematics health services or the famous European health card to these people ?
The discussion was not without results either .
Mr President , I would like to make a personal statement pursuant to Rule 122 , which allows the speaker three minutes .
What kind of a joke is that !
I should like to also say to him that this is his first chance to speak to the citizens of the European Union , in particular the 290 million citizens who will be covered by his Central Bank .
The Commission needs to speed up the procedures , to issue delegated acts , so that the countries know the details and what they need to do to adapt .
What is demonstrated not only by this rejection on the part of the public but also by the tactical infighting on internal policies and national egoisms within the Council is that the EU is in a crisis and will not find it easy to extricate itself from it .
I would much rather see changes to the fundamentals of this framework decided under ordinary legislative procedures .
It is a tragedy for Israel too , because it will simply lead to more hatred and revulsion .
That is where the reasons are listed which , with the passages being clearly headed , we normally have in the remarks , in the conditions which the Commission has to fulfil in connection with the decision on discharge .
Opportunities for funding therefore have to be improved considerably .
That was a point of order based on Rule 103 .
I believe we have found the right way forward together there .
Since then , two of them have been arrested and yet Russia has been awarded a prestigious football tournament - the World Cup - in 2018 , over and above five EU countries .
I think that Parliament has the first word in this consultation process .
We would point out that the existing habitat directive affords the government sufficient opportunity to step in when the implementation of existing projects is hampered by the habitat provisions .
To return to migratory birds , I think hunters have a great opportunity to be used in this situation to keep us informed of the way things are .
Madam President , the first of May , which is a day of celebration for us in the West , unfortunately continues to be a day of struggle in Iran .
On the second question about finance and the economy and what Mr Verhofstadt said : we can all have more ambition , and on that matter let me tell you that I share your ambition .
Quite the opposite : I believe that enhanced coordination would not endanger but reinforce the independence of the European Central Bank . A higher degree of economic convergence would also facilitate its task as it would even alleviate the problem of a &quot; one size fits all &quot; monetary policy , and therefore reduce the risk of putting the ECB under political pressure .
In this respect I will focus on just one point , the matter of fair access to the electricity network .
Finally , let us not forget to target those who are the most interested , and I mean the SMEs .
Belarus ( debate )
There is in other words a risk of a growing conflict between the euro and Europe &apos;s interests .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Constitutional Treaty represents significant progress in the process of bringing Europe together , and that is why I voted in favour of it .
I trust I can count on your support in this endeavour .
I welcome the Commission &apos;s initiative and the work done by the rapporteurs .
I am convinced that the Treaty will solve many of the problems identified in the report in particular by Mr Kuhne .
in writing . - I support this report which recommends faster , more flexible payments for structural funding .
I am also very happy about the establishment of a separate delegation for Belarus in the European Parliament .
We have to understand the enormous difficulties these countries face as they set about constructing a market economy and a state for the first time .
Instead , it focuses on the importance of developing the domestic market as a necessary basis for any economically sustainable development .
In my opinion , therefore , this argument is misplaced , and for that reason I believe that this aspect is probably not integral to Mr Musotto &apos;s report .
Responsibility is not just an empty word that can be used at will to terminate a debate and hasten on to the next item .
Is it really the kraken of a new superstate that feeds on the national identity of its citizens ?
Might I ask you to clarify one point ?
Moreover , some of the amendments pre @-@ empt a debate we should have on the basis of the Green Paper .
It concerns the principal task the Commission has been given through Article 155 of the EC Treaty , namely to &apos; ensure that the provisions of the Treaty and the measures taken by the institutions pursuant thereto are applied.&apos;
I believe it is crucial , for the sake of the credibility of our leadership , that the Member States also start to take action .
I oppose these market interventions .
Slovakia , a country of just over five million people , has been independent for a mere 15 years .
It is important for me also to mention once more that we in the European Union produce around 2 million tonnes of fishery , fish and aquaculture products , but we consume 8 million tonnes .
On that occasion I was told : ‘ We want to join Europe because Europe is a union of minorities ; it is a union in which no one is the arbiter of the others , no one has power over the others ’ .
Europol is one of the many stages which have been taken towards a United States of Europe .
As I said during our meeting in Paris on 1 July , the Commission will stand by the French Presidency , offering its full support to ensure the success of the European Union during these six months .
Having said that , I believe that the revised Cotonou Agreement represents considerable progress , particularly with regard to the role of local sectors in development policy : for the first time , their role has been clarified , and they are explicitly recognised as full partners in the political dialogue .
Its actual tendency , though , does not have the rigour that it needs to distinguish itself from something that I regard as giving cause for concern .
By observing each separate principle , the necessary protection can be achieved .
Ladies and gentlemen , you must understand that it was Stalin who overcame Abkhazia and integrated it into Georgia .
For the rest , the resignation of the Commission was not an institutional crisis , quite the contrary .
There will be a specific communication on this thematic programme , setting out the scope , objectives and political priorities , which will be presented at the end of January .
I thank you .
How was it actually possible for the Irish banks to pass the stress tests ?
It is now imprinted on the collective conscience that we can use technological progress to resolve these problems of civilization , quality of life and health of our people .
As far as Europe is concerned , one viable , practical solution for protecting the environment is to put the Rhine @-@ Main @-@ Danube navigation canal , which provides a direct link between the ports of Rotterdam and Constanţa , into operation .
I am calling on the Council to enter into negotiations with Parliament very quickly so that we can hold the first reading of the hedge fund regulation before the summer .
It was therefore necessary for the Commission to authorise the slaughter of pigs from Northern Ireland in the Republic of Ireland .
If we are simply going to read speeches to each other , we might as well exchange our views by post .
My personal opinion is that the only good response to the economic development of China - which we are not going to stop , by the way - the only good response is to become stronger ourselves .
On Natura 2000 , we have to strike a delicate balance .
What is more , it gives the chance to release personal initiative , innovation and more involvement in various activities .
The time has come for concrete measures and for putting theory into practice .
Likewise , it is also a mistake to try to link budgetary reform to the adoption of a Constitution or a Constitutional Treaty and to further enlargement , because it sends out the wrong signals with regard to what the European Union should be about .
Mr President , Europe is , after all , about unity in diversity , and so I would like to put the following question . How do you think the right of veto will develop ?
I appeal to our Socialist Members in particular .
We are against thieving Rome for the same reasons that we say ‘ no ’ to the accession of Turkey to Europe .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the subject we are dealing with today is particularly difficult because it is technical and that is why it was entrusted to a distinguished rapporteur in the person of Mr Jacob .
That has of course enabled us to influence the budget deliberations in Brussels , and that I regarded as a very good thing .
While we are worrying about early years learning , putting out all our propaganda about drawing Europe together , and producing The Raspberry Ice Cream War , and while our children are being encouraged to read the unintentionally hilarious &apos; Captain Euro &apos; , our part of the world is being overtaken by more virile countries that have learned the benefits of decentralisation and the dispersal of power .
How do we intend to formulate a European defence policy if we are unable to force our partners to abide by such clear obligations in respect of areas so close to us ?
How will our people react in the face of judgments , condemnations , penalties and exclusions which will be personalized and which will directly challenge the management of the governments they have elected to implement their wishes ?
Ladies and gentlemen , we propose that they be entered directly in the voting time on Thursday at 12 noon .
Responsible - I stress this .
Jobs have been created , but not enough of them . Social conditions in Europe have also failed to improve : 15 % of workers live below the poverty line .
However , I want to argue that , while supporting the wider Europe and new neighbours initiative , this must not be used to diminish Europe &apos;s global reach .
You represent the bank of discontent and mass unemployment .
They land in Lampedusa and a few in Malta , and we are the only ones taking them in .
Thus we have to deal with two threats : on the one hand , explosion , and on the other , paralysis .
In our joint paper on the EU ’ s future role in Kosovo , presented in July this year , Javier Solana and I made it clear that the EU will have to take the lead in international presence after the status process has been concluded .
The learning of languages must not be limited to one year , but must become and remain a continuous process .
Under this umbrella , each Member State is to submit proposals in the form of a Community initiative programme for that particular country .
Is it not time that you understood the Rules ?
I am particularly glad that your House shares our view .
The real problem lies with Britain ’ s open border policy and the right of EU citizens to unhindered entry to the UK , as well as the Government ’ s complete abdication of any control over who can and cannot come in from anywhere in the world .
To this end , I would like to point out that the cancellation of Iraq ’ s debt alone corresponds to the amount received by sub @-@ Saharan Africa over the past ten years .
It seems to me that we do this often , too often .
This is an important part of the European internal market and in the Green Paper the Commission has tried to carry out a stocktaking exercise .
This percentage is an average , because in eastern Germany the rate is as much as 80 % .
How does it intend to persuade the Egyptian authorities to improve the situation of the Coptic community ?
If we are to justify this to our citizens , we first need to know why it is needed at all .
I think that , exceptionally , Mr Bangemann can also be singled out on this issue for having supported the campaign for consumer protection .
This is why I find it laudable and encouraging that all the groups in Parliament have been united in their condemnation of the abuses committed by the Cuban authorities against human rights , not to mention the constructive approach , receptive to dialogue , which the EU has decided to adopt towards Cuba .
The old theories about free trade always being a win @-@ win arrangement are shown to be fundamentally flawed and therefore the Commission urgently needs to undertake more research in order to understand these new trends better and formulate appropriate policy approaches .
Therefore , I hope that this morning we will recommit ourselves to both ensuring that the budget for the current structural fund programme is fully committed in the 1999 budget , fully honouring the Edinburgh Agreement , and that everything possible is done to ensure that the new programming period from 2000 onwards starts on time .
That is why a suitable legal basis must be set up within the framework of the Council decision , so that early warning systems can be developed within the framework of the mechanism .
I would urge President Van Rompuy and President Barroso to reconsider the nature of the so @-@ called exit strategy .
The Assembly plays a crucial role in monitoring the implementation of legislation and implementation of the Peace Agreement .
In some respects I think the points that she made in the latter part of her supplementary question are matters that should be put to the domestic administrations both in Ireland and perhaps in Spain .
This is vital to ensuring that people can make the right choices about their diet , and is one of the best ways we can tackle the diet @-@ related diseases which are so prominent across the European Union .
So we must respect this principle of subsidiarity and it must also extend to regional level .
I therefore want to stick to the Commission &apos;s original idea on comitology .
Member States , hospitals , patient associations and treatment providers can all learn from each other .
It is a very difficult task under any circumstances to try to persuade growers in a given sector to cut back their production .
Mr President , the Watson report uses the issues of the day to accelerate the communitisation of the EU .
( The sitting was closed at 12 midnight )
For example , in 2006 we shall define indicators for gynaecological health and the menopause , such as an endometriosis indicator which is , of course , extremely important .
I believe it is misguided .
( The President cut off the speaker )
We cannot accept that countries should run up national debts without limitation .
We have subjected EU assistance to those countries to very strict conditions as it is : the return home of refugees , the fight against corruption and cooperation with the Tribunal in The Hague .
In truth , as rapporteur , I cannot ignore the notion that closer cooperation would , above all , have some virtual effectiveness : it would hardly ever be used , but one hopes that the risk of its use would do away with one blockage or another .
If this Article is applied with regard to alcohol , should not the alcohol policy be able to constitute a permanent derogation , since alcohol demonstrably damages people &amp; # x02BC ; s lives .
In my view , there is only one important question left today .
I have seen how Parliament argued and voted on the SWIFT question .
Even when incurred in the context of an operator &apos;s business activity , such expenditure is , by its very nature , intended to satisfy personal needs .
The Portuguese version talks of the GNP whereas the English version talks about the GDP .
I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendations will be adhered to .
By attacking a judge this time , the terrorists are demonstrating this once more .
The billions spent by our countries , as Mr Patten mentioned just now , and the thousands of soldiers we are deploying there are not preventing the Muslims from ethnically cleansing the 200 000 Serbs still living in Kosovo .
On the contrary , if the single currency did not exist , the adverse effects of the crisis would be much greater .
So although I understand how important the programmes concerned with specific diseases are , I would like to stress how vital it also is for the Commission in the future , in the formulation of its public health programme , to promote health at national level by means of a structured health policy ; in other words , by addressing questions of social policy , such as how efficient agriculture is , how different pesticides are used , which is to say , should more ecological prudence be applied ?
British mothers currently get six weeks of 90 % salary , followed by 33 weeks statutory maternity pay of GBP 125 a week .
The recommendation for the year 2000 has been formulated at a time of favourable developments and optimistic prospects for the European economy .
On this point there is clearly a distinction to be made between democrats and vinocrats .
So far , the promises which have been made are still , however , to be fulfilled , especially where transparency is concerned .
The Commission is also concerned about the reduction of the time allowed for transposition .
I would also like to congratulate him on his excellent substantive work , as well as on his great sensitivity during the negotiations , which enabled us to achieve a compromise among the parliamentary groups and among the European institutions .
We must not concentrate on just one aspect ; we need to remain receptive to a distribution in terms of people .
It is a fundamental reform .
In conclusion , I would like to stress that the reports by Parliament are most welcome , as are the joint meetings of the Committee on Foreign Affairs with the corresponding committees of the national parliaments and the public hearings .
The link with European agricultural protectionism is nevertheless very distressing in this case as well .
Mr President , I would also like to talk about this issue .
It would thus be very important to create mechanisms to ensure that the European partners , at various times in their recent history engulfed in recession , do not get into inordinate economic difficulties .
We wish to make sure that this is properly addressed .

What Turkey is in fact doing is prohibiting vessels proceeding from Cypriot ports from approaching Turkish ports .
A large number of associated industries were brought to a virtual standstill .

Furthermore , we must invest in protecting the climate and not direct all or most of our investment in energy towards nuclear programmes .
I would like to thank Mrs Fontaine in particular ; she has provided an excellent summary of all the proposals , reports and amendments which have been tabled .
Finally , I believe that we should remain vigilant regarding the issue of renewing the cars on the road in the Union .
We will not agree to women having fewer rights than men , in Europe or elsewhere in the world .
They hoped that the issue would never have to be raised again , let alone regulated by laws banning racist acts .
If that is the case , then I , and I suspect , Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt as well , would be prepared to be very combative on this .
What we favour is the involvement of the social partners and European social dialogue .
Moreover , the Commission has carried out communication actions in the wake of the 10th International Day against the Death Penalty .
I know of no one with any interest whatsoever in fisheries who would not support the principle of environmentally friendly fishing methods : the people with most to gain , after all , from protecting the marine environment and ensuring a balance between conservation and harvesting of fish stocks are the fishermen themselves .
This would be an illegal manoeuvre , as the European elections are meant to elect representatives to the European Parliament to deal with a very wide range of subjects , but not the possible constitution , to which different methods of decision @-@ making would apply .
At a time of increasing reliance on fuel and energy supplies from third countries and increasingly stringent standards for environmental emissions , renewable sources of energy are among the most important aspects of ensuring secure energy supplies .
The return of these states to brutal capitalism and the increasing stranglehold of powerful investors from the west are already causing a considerable rise in social inequalities .
That is why it is a great project , and I would thank all those who have spoken in favour of it .
From a Machiavellian viewpoint , can this kind of attitude guarantee effectively that such and such an ‘ enlightened conservative ’ or such and such a ‘ progressive ’ will reap the lucrative benefits of re @-@ election ?
In my opinion , the question of the compulsory wearing of safety belts has a crucial part to play .
Supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products ( Codified version ) (
Outside parliament we can of course use our mother tongue ; we can even use it in some higher education institutions , albeit to a much lesser extent than is warranted in view of the proportion of Hungarian speakers in the population .
- the report ( A6 @-@ 0043 / 2005 ) by Mr Dombrovskis , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , on the guidelines for Sections II , IV , V , VI , VII , VIII ( A ) and VIII ( B ) and on the European Parliament &apos;s preliminary draft estimates ( Section I ) for the 2006 budgetary procedure
Can agreements be made in transatlantic relations on combating terrorism or is it to remain at the level of unilaterally imposed measures ?
Mr President , I agree with a lot that has been said about the lack of consultation with this Parliament and I hope that the Commissioner present will take that back to the Commission .
Turning to the substance of the programme , in the time that remains to me , I shall focus on just one issue , given that other honourable Members will subsequently be taking up other points .
In the 2007 budget , Parliament has , in accordance with the Council , increased disbursements , in return for which expenditure will not exceed 1 % of the Union &apos;s GNI .

There is broad agreement between the institutions on the initial scope of the centre .
When you discuss the Financial Perspective and , I hope , come to some decisions on it , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office – and I am also saying this to the Commission – I urge you to remember that you , in the Council , are not taking decisions on your own ; the European Parliament is part of the budgetary authority , and it possesses equal rights of codecision , so you need to guarantee that it is fully involved .
We also consider that Sweden &apos;s membership contribution constitutes a serious burden on Swedish state finances and so is partly to blame for the cuts in social expenditure which are causing unemployment and social division in our home country .
The prime ministers would , then , meet after each election to the European Parliament and divide the posts among themselves .
The military pressure on the insurgents must be matched by an intensive political process , and by a dialogue with all segments of the population that recognise the Constitution and are willing to lay down their weapons .
In my opinion , the amendments presented by the Committee on Legal Affairs must be approved in their entirety .
Certainly , by defining precise criteria the European Commission must develop this concept of absorption capacity .
The bad news is that , over four months after their acquittal , their bail money has still not been returned .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Lagendijk , on his report , which is an excellent one .
The greater use of trans @-@ European networks for communication between traders and excise authorities , and between excise authorities themselves , will reduce the time needed for the discharge of tax liability for excise movements .
Work on the Rome I and Rome III Regulations is under way .
Furthermore , we have achieved a new situation for Turkey , in heading 7 , which has a dual significance : it contains a political message for that country and it allows us room for manoeuvre within heading 4 on foreign policy .
To this extent , the directive is a genuine contribution towards achieving harmonization .
We will have this in 2010 , provided we follow the rapporteur &apos;s proposal .
It is important that initiatives developed by Member States and businesses with regard to network security are well coordinated at European level .
I cannot vote for this proposal tomorrow if the emasculation of Article 4 takes place .
What we need now is joint and tangible action within the agreed timeframe , not national squabbling .
When he was President of the European Commission , Romano Prodi talked about setting up a Euro @-@ Arab development bank , jointly financed and managed by both sides .

The Nicaraguan government spent US $ 17 on health and US $ 16 on education per head of population , but about one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half times the combined total , US $ 47.40 per head , was spent on debt servicing last year .
How are we to deal with the fact that a nuclear meltdown could occur in any of the plants that we operate ?

For years , we have been saying that Europe is ageing and dying .
After these amending budgets , this Agency &apos;s budget increased to EUR 19.2 million .
An extremely high level of corruption , poverty and disorder catapulted Lukashenko to power in 1994 , but his remedy was too brutal : he eliminated some of the corruption but his authoritarian tendencies were combined with the sort of dirigisme which had already led to the break @-@ up of the Soviet Union , and there has been little change since then .
There are three ways competition policy can contribute to partnership .
We must take action to keep its people in their own lands , to support them in their aspirations to live and prosper there .
- ( FR ) The project on which we are called upon to declare our opinion in the form of the report by our fellow member , Mr Graça @-@ Moura , is hardly a matter for controversy and is one which can legitimately gain the support of Parliament in its entirety .
Without this opportunity to launder money , national and international terrorism will find it hard to survive .
Indeed the key to reform is ending the war against the Kurds , which gives the pretext for the state of emergency and the repression that goes with it .
We have managed to get the priorities we wanted included in the budget , which no one can dispute .
This leads me in turn to criticize that practice , that pragmatic strategy , which the rapporteur is proposing in order to extend parliamentary rights and tackle the problem of democratic deficit .
- ( NL ) Europe is wealthy and powerful .
We must now take decisions .
I hope that the Commission , whose Communication has had a mixed reception , not very positive in some cases , will see this as an opportunity to take more account of social responsibility .

I voted for the report to say No to cowboy sales via the Internet , the preferred channel for placing these poisons on to the European Union pharmaceutical market .
( Applause )
If we look at them , it is hardly these countries which have experienced the greatest economic growth in the last decade .
This strategy is certainly needed before we can decide whether there is to be a new Counter @-@ Terrorism Coordinator .
Let us compete together , but for heaven &apos;s sake let us get to grips with something on which we can really deliver , instead of having a whole lot of vague targets , which is what I see in this proposal .
This report also rejects the exclusive following of an approach that promotes austerity to resolve the EU &apos;s economic problems .
As to the extent of payment appropriations in the draft budget , the Council has expressed a preference for limited and controlled growth .
. – This proposal is about addressing the period between the expiry of the protocol attached to the fisheries agreement between the European Union and the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros and the date by which the Commission believes the assessments needed to renegotiate the agreement will have been completed .

It is impermissible to juxtapose the collective guilt of the Roma and the collective responsibility of the majority , the oppressors .
Democratic governments are not established through fraud , violence or fear .
It is possible that the Council may decide to further extend sanctions in view of the stalemate and lack of progress in inter @-@ party dialogue and the continued repression and violence we see in Zimbabwe .
That is why we need REACH , but a REACH that manages to deliver what it promises .
The Commission , has , unfortunately , already made its choice , Mr McCreevy , and contributed unhelpfully to the compromise between the two big groups .
The more children a woman bears , the smaller the chance she has of developing breast cancer , ovarian cancer or cancer of the uterus .
Let us not be content with telling those 25 million that they are the backbone of the European economy , and then do nothing beyond that .
We in the European Parliament have therefore to take full responsibility vis @-@ à @-@ vis the electors . We want to live up to that responsibility .
There is one point on which I agree with Mr Sturdy .
As we have recently seen from the Luxembourg conclusions , participation in these programmes offers the central and eastern European countries the possibility of becoming familiar with the policies and instruments of the Community , not only on a political and administrative level but also on a much @-@ quoted basis .
Irrespective of the legal form the Charter of Fundamental Rights will take , it will , in any case , be an expression of the Member States &apos; common constitutional traditions which , in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty , shall be respected by the Union and therefore also by the institutions and public bodies .
We talked in the past about &quot; unequal &apos; agreements concluded between China and the European powers .

The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
It may well be the case that richer countries have a higher cofinancing percentage than poor countries .
Indeed , it is the effectiveness of the European Commission &apos;s proposal which causes me great concern .
Much can be achieved at Member State level where national characteristics may prescribe different solutions and much must be done by industry which has prime responsibility for its own competitiveness .
If we let Saddam carry on in the way that he is , then what message does this send to others of malign intent ?
The reality is that , in the successive crises that we have just experienced , Europe has been there , has coordinated itself , has worked as a team .
That would be a signal of our support for the International Criminal Court , as well as a positive example for other governments .
I still have some questions , however , that I would like to put to the Council . Does the Council envisage taking any particular measures to protect troops and humanitarian missions on the ground in Afghanistan ?
Millions of people in Europe are afraid of losing their jobs and , frankly , I do not understand the position of the French President in opposing the summit : a fully fledged summit is something we need at this moment .
Ladies and gentlemen , the EU ’ s most recent enlargement brought a number of changes to the fruit and vegetable market .
Even in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , I felt it necessary to distance myself from certain positions that appear only to favour sectional objectives and are likely to produce a much more disastrous outcome both for the environment and for many Member States ’ economies .
As chairman of the delegation for relations with Iran and spokeswoman on foreign policy , I would also say that anyone who has not learned from the Iran crisis over recent years , which has often put us in danger of military escalation , that the civil use of nuclear power cannot be divorced from military abuse and proliferation , has failed to understand the entire foreign policy of recent years , the dangers and our nuclear disarmament challenge .
In this respect , please note that an increase from 5 % to 6.5 % may seem small at first glance , but in reality it is not .
We are seeing an increase in illegal migratory flows , generally controlled by criminal networks that give misleading information to potential migrants , who end up forced to work in conditions completely different to those they were promised , which might even include physical and or mental abuse and breaches of their human rights .
Thus , it does not strike me as impossible to support that .
Mr President , I would first like to thank all fellow MEPs and rapporteurs .
He emphasises the importance of small and medium @-@ sized businesses and sets out a long list of initiatives that I believe will enhance the process .
It is necessary to encourage these developments in new Member States which have extensive experience in those areas , such as Bulgaria , which has research teams that have been working on such projects for many years now , and have achieved considerable success .
I am very pleased that the authors of the report have appreciated these circumstances and decided to remove from the primary text the names of states whose stance might be viewed critically by the European Parliament .
Some states base their hopes for currency stabilisation on this measure , fearing a repetition of the recent speculative attacks on their currencies .
I believe that the informed consent of the donor must always be a basis for donation and for transplantation of organs .
We should have set a cut @-@ off point , but we failed to do so and now we have to continue and hope against hope for success .
For that reason definition by means of a concluding list , as proposed by the rapporteur , would in this case inhibit the flexible use of this regulation in the future and limit its scope .
These opportunities have been discussed in joint talks between the European Union and Russia .
It is the first in which we have desisted from calling for any increase in the global volume proposed by the Commission , instead preferring a realistic and political approach .
Together I am sure we can make something which will be of lasting benefit to our citizens and help them improve the quality of their daily lives .
Mr President , on behalf of the Polish group within the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats I would like to express our high esteem for you .
If the EU wishes to boost public confidence in integration , it must form a united front and become a strong partner for the WTO , on a par with Japan , China and the USA .
We have before us today a special case which is not a model worth following .
Now to the problems .
I am voting in favour of the participation of Croatia in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ( EMCDDA ) , as the EMCDDA is open to the participation of any third country , and particularly bearing in mind that Croatia is a transit route through which illicit drugs are smuggled on the way from the production countries to consumer countries .
The enormity of what the IRA has done should neither be underestimated nor undervalued . I should like to take this opportunity to praise the IRA for taking risks when others shirked their responsibilities .
On the level of the fifteen Member States , the debates have focused on the following issues , which must be resolved at the General Affairs Council of 17 June , immediately prior to Seville : firstly the coherence of Community policies , without prejudice to the adaptation of Community policies to the internal and external objectives of sustainable development .
This is crucial in avoiding the proliferation of weapons .
We could not rush the process either , without ensuring that we had the support of the people in the Union .
Well , I did not hear a real question , but of course we agree that there are multiple reasons to say &apos; no &apos; to Turkey .
Its approach has been to work with civil society and NGOs to promote active citizenship .
In fact I describe it to my constituents as the complaints department of the Parliament .
My entrance into cyberspace has created rapid reaction among a lot of bloggers .
They have , in fact ; I had the opportunity to say so during the Ecofin meeting that unanimously proposed him as a candidate .
China has indicated that it will start accession negotiations by December this year and , following my visit there last year , we are already preparing this important accession .
There are not many of you in the Chamber yet , in fact only just enough to make up a football team , which brings me to the subject of this debate .
It has , moreover , invited calls for the Commission to draw up a European initiative in 2005 in favour of energy efficiency , in addition to a Green Paper comprising a list of significantmeasures .
If it does not , we shall have squandered a unique opportunity .
I would like to draw your attention to the excellent report by Mr Kirkhope on the subject .
I agree that an active and positive approach to the EU on the part of Ukraine is not the only assessment criterion .
Nor do we wish to support paragraph 15 , according to which Parliament wishes all the old , and also the new , Member States to adopt the euro .
The present crisis is the hideous aftermath of a credit mania , specifically of the excessive expansion of debt .
The result is that there is never enough EU money to go round .
These are the points that we have fought for in this House and would like to see voted through .
Although the issue is a difficult and sensitive one , a joint project has been got up and running , symbolising the desire of both communities to build a shared future .
Previous Parliament resolutions have inspired a significant number of the initiatives introduced in the communication .
But it should be the case that the results of the hunt can be used , and I hope particularly that those parts of seals that can be used by the medical community will be able to be used .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - ( SV ) Mr President , first of all let me congratulate and thank our rapporteur for her work on this matter , as also the Commissioner .
in writing . - ( PL ) Mr President , can one expect to sort out the world &apos;s problems without first putting one &apos;s own house in order ?
Lisbon , and then the Barcelona review and outlook , have fixed new deadlines for delivery .
But from the perspective of small Member States it is important that , as the European Commission is reformed , it must be done in a way that ensures that small Member States continue to have representation on the Commission .
Although this ambitious scheme seems to have fitted into a proper technocratic mould , I wonder who will bear the political responsibility for possible future mistakes , a responsibility which is currently borne by the competent national minister or administrator of the Civil Aviation Authority .
It is of course necessary for us to be able to carry out our work here well , but not in such a way that beneficiaries can make easy money and party officials can receive a great deal of money on repeated occasions without contributing anything to the Parliament , a phenomenon which has been proven to occur .
Public service in television is a fundamental concept in a democratic society .
Sudan is about to teach us , the international community , a wonderful lesson about cynicism and about crises that , more out of a sense of resignation than anything else , we often consider to be unsolvable .
It must continue to play a shrewd and uncompromising role in ensuring that all the underlying causes of poverty are dealt with and that the most degrading of its consequences , the trafficking of women for profit in a parallel market which reduces them to nothing more than a commodity , is eliminated .
It is important that we apply as many resources as possible to this .
That is why I need to address this as well and emphasise that beyond housing , other services of general interest and , in particular , other social services play a preventive and socially cohesive role which is targeted at the whole population independently of wealth or income .
It is therefore very clearly I think in the minds of many of us , a hot political dossier .
Protection of workers ’ health and safety is at the heart of a social Europe .
Thank you , Commissioner .
Replacement products used in this sector are hydrocarbons , HCFCs , and to a lesser extent , HFCs .
In 2006 alone , 13 million people from 15 Member States benefitted from aid measures within this programme - valuable help that should be retained .
And what can I say about the proliferation of protocols and declarations : 14 protocols and 46 declarations ?
Given , however , the very weak position in which she found herself following Parliament ’ s second reading , she was unable to achieve the only reasonable objective , namely that of having environmental Article 175 adopted as the only legal basis .
The latter still exist in many European Union Member States .
But it is the Commission &apos;s job to step up pressure on the Member States , and we will be glad to help out .
Every year , 42 000 people die on our roads in daily accidents .
Let us look in particular at those who produce in minority languages and who , inevitably , need to have subtitles for their programmes .
For example , one of the paragraphs which has been weakened from the original draft emphasised the need for enhanced appropriate levels of transparency towards the public , investors and supervisory authorities , including , in the future , any new EU supervisory body .
I hope that all those responsible in Europe have understood that the concern for the profitability of a minority must never prevail over the health requirements for the majority .
Good communications channels between politicians on both sides of the Mediterranean are an important factor in building constructive relations between the ? U and its Mediterranean partners .
Mr President , following the Amsterdam negotiations and the introduction of the new chapter on employment , and following the decision to hold a special summit on employment , Mr JeanClaude Juncker threw down a challenge to all Member States and to our institutions that such a summit would only be worthwhile if it led to concrete and viable steps forward .
And if the US missile shield in the Czech Republic was not bad enough , dependence on the US was also reflected in the Presidency , for example in the way that the Israeli offensive in Gaza was trivialised as defensive action .
And I reminded you that it was precisely during the last Luxembourg Presidency that the budget procedure did not have a successful outcome .
However , here too , I expect you to put your finger on the weak spots clearly and promptly in future .
If this is not the case , I will consider with my colleagues , in the light of recent developments , whether it is appropriate to block the process after successful compromises have been reached , with great effort , on the key points , in order to succeed in concluding an agreement at first reading and to allow the instrument to be launched in January 2007 .
We cannot have cooperation between Parliament and the Commission unless we have greater transparency .
Rule 6 ( 6 ) has therefore not been respected by the Conference of Presidents whose members , as usual , never read our Rules of Procedure .
Court judgments have been passed on this .
I am convinced that such links can make a decisive contribution to achieving the goals that are currently being set , particularly those relating to territorial cohesion .
It is in recognition of this common philosophy that this Parliament , and its rapporteur in particular , hope that the Commission , especially Commissioner Loyola de Palácio , will deliver a favourable opinion and that the Council will approve the amendments that I have tabled today .
Mosques are burned down .
In order to achieve as broad a basis as possible , we will be voting for Amendment No 6 .
That is to say the country of destination principle , as opposed to the country of origin principle .
The second aspect relates to solidarity .
In our modern @-@ day society , chemicals are all around us .
We are talking generally about offshore exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons and the best possible level of technical security .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , thank you for this opportunity to debate before the Commission deliberates on these proposals .
For that reason we have to equip ourselves with something one might call robust pragmatism in order to be strong enough to stay on course and pragmatic enough to know whether or not we can make headway in a given case .
It is also important to mark the importance of this item of legislation .
We do not need a completely new set of rules , we simply have to ensure that we remain competitive in the years to come .
Do we really need a common working time directive ?
If in the future Europe is to be a stable and peaceful continent where democracy and human freedoms and rights are honoured and established principles , any federal tendencies within the European Union must be opposed .
Again , in principle , I welcome that .
The events themselves , the fatal incidences of these serious &quot; unprecedented &apos; diseases , should have forced us to confront the crucial questions about the quality of our foodstuffs and the enormous risks to consumer safety .
( HU ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I believe a strong and efficient cohesion policy is inconceivable .
We are ready to meet that challenge .
I have been talking with my colleague , Mrs Madeira , and have also , of course , listened to the Commissioner &apos;s answers .
In my view , it is not possible to increase efficiency by force through a surfeit of minor regulations emanating from Brussels .
What has repeatedly motivated us as Europeans and the European Parliament in these matters is firstly the fact that the death penalty still exists at all in the United States , and secondly the circumstances under which it is carried out .
The European Union , if it is to be strong when facing the new challenges , must be united and coherent .
Your country is at the crossroads of the Mediterranean and has always been at the centre of policies relating to Europe ’ s southern borders .
Mr President , it is a pleasure to speak for the first time when you are sitting in the Chair .
Other important lines of policy in the report with which I am in full agreement are increasing energy efficiency and increasing the share of sustainable energy .
The European neighbourhood policy is an expression of such a comprehensive and integrated partner strategy .
So we must find this combination and address the situation .
Commissioner , perhaps you could mention that paragraph in particular to some of your auditor colleagues .
Lastly , to conclude , a remark on the Euratom programme : I agree with the appropriations proposed in the report ; we need to give the green light to the ITER project , which must not , however , be confused with the nuclear power schemes we know today .
Unlike the other areas in which the Treaty has undergone substantial amendments , marine biological resources are not solely the institutional concern of politicians .
We have provided support for the Belarusian Association of Journalists , for which it is very grateful .
Perhaps the Council will arrive later on .
Forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting : see Minutes
It is important that this Parliament takes its scrutiny and monitoring roles seriously as regard structural fund applications .
The postal service cannot be set free to compete - not completely , at any rate - because it has social functions to fulfil .
Many of you talked about money .
The question concerns the specific immigration status of a specific Kosovan refugee and the failure to provide visas for him from embassies in other EU states .
As British Conservatives we confirm our concern about health and safety for all workers , especially vulnerable groups .
We have been informed of a dozen amendments tabled by Mr Cocilovo , on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , which concern the definition of assisting spouses and life partners .
Mr President , we have , of course , far too little time to discuss Mrs Kinnock &apos; s excellent report properly .
Measures to counter the dangerous domino effect of terrorism throughout the Horn of Africa must be made effective .
Mr Seppänen criticised Finland ’ s aim to ratify the Constitution , saying that we do not respect the results of the French and Dutch referendums .
Political parties are being outlawed , Kurdish mayors arrested and Christians are subject to intimidation , violence and administrative prejudice .
This is something we owe to ourselves and to Mexican society .
I presume that the Commissioner is holding consultations with him with a view to arriving at a framework outlining clear commitments .
I think that first we must seek out all renewable energies and take advantage of them , encourage them , promote them and provide the appropriate incentives to make them viable , and at the same time penalise energies that contaminate .
Then , after investigation , commercial policy measures can be taken vis @-@ à @-@ vis the third country in question .
The reason for the international day of solidarity is the aggressive behaviour of a global package delivery company against its own employees , who want to form a trade union .
Madam President , I have to say again that to argue in terms of the WTO , Commissioner , is not actually an answer .
However , a lot has happened since 1971 .
I would therefore like to stress that I do not consider the primary reason for increasing this limit to be either the expansion of the European Union or the greater number of states outside the euro area , as is stated in the explanatory report .
When we usually think of insects , the associations they conjure up are not particularly pleasant .
Dates for next sittings : see Minutes
As I said , we are talking about our daily bread here .
No one can have any doubt about this , but it is clear that , through persistent and concerted action , we can , I hope , be successful .
And what about the camp where there are more than 5 , 000 children without any parents ?
( DE ) Mr President , taxing speculation - which , in many cases , brings no benefit for the real economy - by means of a financial transaction tax is undoubtedly the right approach .
If we consider the issue of funding for networks , for example , it is clear that it will be possible to strike a balance between networks , on the one hand , and research , on the other , if the outcome of the agreement on the fifth framework programme for research is known .
This disparity in the costs announced by the Commission , just like the costs put forward by the industry , is enormous .
The national parliaments must give more debating time to social security , bearing in mind the need to encourage and sustain a high level of employment .
First of all , we need to establish what the territorial integrity of Georgia means , for at present this is understood in several different ways .
The natural order is violated , and consequently acts as a source of chaos , unhappiness and suffering for many people , including those in future generations who will be brought to life in test tubes .
He demonstrated his public @-@ spiritedness by photographing the illegal dumping of atomic waste .
She continued to work in this way with me , coordinating the completion of the trans @-@ European networks and their extension to neighbouring countries of the Union .
Some of the Euratom aspects are missing , as well as research , structural funds , MEDA and large aspects of PHARE and TACIS .
We need to encourage the creation of a world trade market for LPG and LNG to ease Europe &apos;s dependency on a single source for natural gas .
Taking into account the post @-@ Copenhagen context , adaptation to and mitigation of climate change will continue to top the agenda and will require supportive energy policies .
The Commission closely follows the human rights situation in Zimbabwe .
I call on Mr Haarder to speak on behalf of the Council .
There are difficulties in relation to cost and bureaucracy .
This chap Giorgio Napolitano says we can then be an autonomous territorial entity . Then the likes of me can be on the Committee of the Regions which has recently affirmed its exclusive legitimacy as an institutional discussion partner .
I find it difficult when talking to voters to explain that we take decisions here in a profound and deliberate way when their standard of living has deteriorated since joining the European Union .
In this respect , I would like to express my concern regarding the comments made by some of the members of the Commission or the Convention , who stated that , when clarifying the texts , we could certainly delete Article 299 ( 2 ) of the Treaty of Amsterdam , which provides the legal basis for the measures taken to assist the outermost regions .
The Council has referred to reforming the system for regional aid .
Once again , action was taken when that came to light .
( DE ) Madam President , the European Parliament has succeeded in putting in place an ambitious , long @-@ term target in the face of opposition from the Council and the Commission , which will restrict the CO2 emissions of small vans to a maximum of 147 grams per kilometre by 2020 .
. ( EL ) The Commission &apos; s draft and more so the Council &apos; s draft EU budget for 2000 are marked by their austerity and drastic cuts , even in relation to the decisions reached at the European Council meeting in Berlin .
This is a contribution in the environmental interest and marks further progress for Europe &apos;s agriculture .
EUR 90 million has so far been squandered on this scheme , and the Commission would like to spend more .
This should also make it possible to accelerate the convergence of labour market and employment policy , as a further important element of economic and monetary integration .
I would hope that the end result is very close to our proposal .
We would like to know , however , under what status we have been called , since the Presidency announced that the IND @-@ DEM Group had excluded us , using a procedure that was totally incomprehensible and completely irregular .
They have given it to us so often .
It is for these reasons that I abstained on the resolution , and dissented from my political group .
It is neither sensible nor proper that the European Monetary Institute should condemn certain national laws as incompatible with a central bank system .
These are very moving words for me and my generation , my parents who both served in the Second World War .
Article 5 &apos; appears both to permit and to exclude the patenting of human gene sequences &apos; .
As for the idea of setting up a more permanent structure to deal with such situations , I will forward the information to my colleagues , who will doubtless give it careful consideration .
With this legislation , we now have a Community law that nobody can evade , one that can be adopted and amended by a majority , and the Commission ’ s role as guardian and administrator of Community law means that no Member State can admit that it is doing something not quite right in its own airspace control and safety measures , while asserting that it is no business whatever of the Commission ’ s .
Mr President , Mr Cunha said earlier that the best cure for Commissioner Fischler &apos;s flu would be to eat Portuguese cod .
That would be one way of proceeding .
The way to resolve the recent conflicts in Bahrain , for example , is by engaging civil society and not by using violent repression .
Much in this upturn has to do , in the first instance , with the economic cycle , and it is because we cannot be certain that it will continue that our report takes the line that action on our part is needed , that we need to manage and direct , that we must not take time out and allow the clock to keep ticking while we neglect to take the necessary political steps .
No doubt the acarid varroa parasite is partly responsible , as in Germany where , in 2002 , it destroyed 40 % of the bee population .
We have made a number of proposals asking the Commission to allow simpler labels to be affixed to textile products .
The fact is that the Berlin conference did not merely call for a study ; it also made it quite plain in its concluding resolutions that 20 % was a desirable target for 2020 , and you can see that our compromise resolution expects no less than that , namely that the Commission and the Council should have that as their goal and that policies should be framed with it in mind .
The next item is the report by Mr Coelho , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , on the draft Council decision on application of all the provisions of the Schengen acquis in Bulgaria and Romania ( 1412 / 2010 - C7 @-@ 0369 / 2010 - 2010 / 0820 ( NLE ) .
However , the options which it offers are neither transparent nor clear enough , and neither are the countries and regions that most need to borrow from it those that are most favoured with its loans .
We approached the transformation of the label not as an administrative transformation of the old transnational institution , but as a new institution with clearly defined selection criteria and binding obligations on the part of recipients if they are to keep it .
It is falcons which have ensured the survival of many birds of prey .
Behind it , after the &apos; Great Leader &apos; Kim Il @-@ Sung , the &apos; Dear Leader &apos; Kim Jong @-@ Il is now playing the depressing game of the &apos; Great Lie &apos; .
In no document of this House is there room for deception and forgery .
I can only repeat that this is not what the legislators intended the instrument to achieve and they have not put aside any taxpayers &apos; money for this purpose .
Even the management itself of the outlined package of measures is an important element , in the sense that we should not overlook the fact that at present , most candidate countries do not have appropriate structures in place to manage properly the regional policy in the way we in most cases propose .
I feel that the plenary is within its rights to state its opinion on the position adopted by the Conference of Presidents .
The economies of China , India and others are racing ahead at 10 % per year .
These are journalists who wish to cover the election and who are not therefore being given an opportunity to offer a critical analysis of what is happening .
In addition , we are undertaking not to ask SMEs for the same information several times over - in other words , we will seek to do everything in one go .
Yes , they did .
This is why I emphasise that there is a real need to reduce the disparity between territorially accessible regions and regions facing structural disadvantages .
In general we obtained a good directive .
This was , unfortunately , not the case , and the procedure stands .
Laurent Gbagbo must recognise the results of the elections and hand over power .
That is why the services directive must continue to guarantee the protection of cultural diversity , and that is why it must not apply to these goods .
Documents received : see Minutes
Instead , I think that paragraph 31 of my resolution - the text from the Committee on Budgets - should be modified to remove the words &apos; to create four permanent B5 proofreader posts &apos; , given that this proposal fell during the earlier votes on the budget .
Here too , it was the rapporteur , Mr Bösch , who was particularly insistent on changes being made .
Wilful short @-@ sightedness by the Commission has done no favours for Europe &apos;s consumers , nor even in the end for the EU &apos;s and Ireland &apos;s beef producers .
For example , an EU @-@ China summit , raising relations to a new level and not just through the ASEM process .
This is the assessment of our aid work , so generous in financial terms , which the European public is communicating to our fellow citizens .
Trying to cheat and tempt someone with illusory protocols and concessions in order to change decisions without changing convictions would be an offence and a lack of democratic respect .
What we in Austria did about implementation was to make a mixture of 5.75 % mandatory , and we will achieve that in October 2008 .
I would like to express my sincere thanks to everyone involved .
It should be replaced by the European Inter @-@ University Centre .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Petitions . ( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Committee on Petitions urgently requests the Committee on the Rules of Procedure to take account of the following points when adapting the European Parliament &apos;s Rules of Procedure to the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
I will start with the political dimension .
Other serious shortcomings in this agreement include , for example , the inspection of bank data without judicial approval , the long retention period for data , something that is impermissible under German constitutional law , as well as an inadequate opportunity for people to defend themselves in court against the unfair use of data .
In conclusion , I trust that the Members will reflect on the points I have made and that there will be broad consensus in tomorrow &apos;s votes .
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to read her speech to you .
That amendment is quite simply a violation of the Treaties !
In the area of smoking , legislators have come to recognise the significance of passive smoking and have taken measures to defend the people who are near the smoker .
Human rights must be our watchword , not just in theory but also in practice .
Comparison with the United States clearly shows how far we are from achieving the targets set in Lisbon .
I am not going to talk about discrimination – other Members have done that already – but I will say that I believe violence against women is a problem throughout the world , and particularly in my State , and that both the institutions and society must accept that it is necessary to resolve it .
What is , unfortunately , certain is that there will certainly be another outbreak of foot and mouth disease .
The answer to the honourable Member &apos;s question is that the study on the policy models will start at the beginning of 2005 and will finish roughly one year later , between the beginning and middle of 2006 .
Moreover , from an environmental point of view , we cannot accept restrictions such as the requirement that the goods carried in the course of an incoming international carriage have to have been fully delivered before a cabotage operation can be carried out .
I also recommend that the implementation of concrete measures for the rational use of the river basins is accelerated , especially in the case of those where there are hydropower plants built and most importantly of rivers that ensure the cooling of nuclear plants , because irrational use combined with the accentuated decrease of flows may lead to the closure of many clean electricity production facilities and , as a consequence , could throw the European electric power system out of balance , which would entail major risks to the Union &apos;s security in the electric power sector .
This makes it necessary for dental amalgam waste to be properly disposed of .
We therefore endorse Mr Moreira da Silva &apos;s proposal to introduce a cap , a maximum ceiling , so that we can be certain that emission levels are indeed dropping .
Mr President , to be a credible partner and to act as a global player , the EU needs to speak with one voice .
I hope , whether you stay here or go on to something else , that you will help to stir the national politicians who so far have lacked the will to muster the necessary weapons to fight international crime .
Ladies and gentlemen , for the sake of the well @-@ being and freedom of all citizens of the Union , let us avoid ( in the words of a well @-@ known saying ) &apos; putting the cart before the horse &apos; .
The European Council will then give its opinion on those adjustments .
There are some who think that just because targets are set in this House in Europe , they will be achieved .
Small ports will need to make a considerable effort to accommodate this directive in the foreseeable future .
We now need to increase these lines of credit to be able to meet demand and the European Investment Bank is ready to do that .
It has been pointed out to me that , in the United Kingdom , this demand would no doubt be blown up out of all proportion by one section of the press as a platform for yet another campaign against Europe .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this proposal is seriously unfair , poorly thought out and out of all proportion .
Although European Union Council Directive 90 / 314 / EEC on package holidays protects passengers if the tour operator goes into liquidation , it does not protect them for airline tickets sold on an individual basis .
That is what is proposed .
At the very least , until such time as the level of competition between the different modes of transport is reflected in the reality of grants and proposed harmonization conditions , these aids are a modest means of providing compensation in the interests of a sustainable transport policy .
In addition to repressive measures , it is fundamental that we look at and try to address the root causes - poverty , war , oppression and a whole range of issues - that lead to terrorism .
But I would also like to add here the quality of life of employees .
I do not believe that we do .
There is concern in the region that we are seen to be moving forward and , on occasions , I feel we have got a bit stuck in what we need to do next .
I would never blame the German people for the sins of the regime it had to suffer under Hitler &apos;s dictatorship , and I feel that the same should apply in Yugoslavia .
Two and a half years ago , I visited Nicosia and saw how that city was divided .
We must make that clear to Mr Ashcroft on his visit to Europe later this week .
The role of the United Nations has been just as ineffective , for any UN resolutions that the great powers have found indigestible have been systematically ignored or sidestepped .
I am saying all this because my question has been written incorrectly .
We will keep to this obligation .
More and more women in Europe are going out to work and have to be able to juggle their occupational and family responsibilities .
These areas of our cities are often home to single @-@ parent families , elderly people who receive a pension and no longer carry out productive activity , and families facing difficulties ; sometimes they are families which have broken down and which are excluded from mainstream society .
A telecoms package which consolidates the Union &apos;s telecommunication legislation will have great significance in competition with others outside the European Union .
But precisely in the scientific community it has long been hidden .
For this reason alone , the President and his Commission deserves Parliament ’ s political censure .
I consider , however , that keeping control of this distribution is essential , as is establishing mechanisms to correct the distribution whenever justified .
There is no doubt that the failure of the ratification process of the Constitutional Treaty leaves a permanent shadow of doubt hanging over the European Union .
In this regard , it must be stressed that its principal importance does not lie in the scale of fishing possibilities that it offers or indeed in its cost .
In short , the constitution is all about a peaceful future for our continent , and it is a project that must not be allowed to fail .
We need your support on these initiatives to bring them to a successful end .
The readiness and ability to react will certainly follow on from improvements in coordination and early warning mechanisms as well as stores of appropriate materials and reserves on the international level .
Some stakeholder organisations have even organised regular surveys with their members on the state of implementation .
The case to which the honourable Member refers , the so @-@ called Colombia three , is a matter between the Irish Government and the Colombian Government .
We wished also to indicate Parliament &apos;s fundamental disapproval of unilateral measures and deplore in no uncertain terms the USA &apos;s declared intention to apply Section 301 and &apos; super 301 &apos; , the spectre of which we were told had been banished for ever thanks to the Marrakesh agreements .
The campaign forms part of our shared efforts to build a true citizens &apos; Europe : Member States , NGOs and the other key actors and , of course , the Commission are very enthusiastic and working hard to make this Year a real success and to ensure that it will also have significant effects , not just this year , but in the years to come .
The vote will be held tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Mr Kuckelkorn criticised the Commission for being so tardy ; he mentioned the delays .
Mr President , the EU is committed to combating the destabilising accumulations of small arms in many parts of the world .
The opening of our education , culture and youth programmes and the establishment of a special economic area are examples of such an approach .
Some of the areas of specific interest that have to be addressed include food supply , health and environmental protection and energy issues .
This will also be an important message from next week &apos;s meeting .
I won &apos;t dwell on any other issues for the moment ; of course , the debate has been very interesting , but there is one major idea to reiterate : that this synergy and the cooperation policy in the Black Sea region should not preclude new prospects for accession .
These are all measures that are heading in the right direction , by imposing rules on the financial markets , in order to help us to get back on track towards growth and employment as soon as possible .
The second question relates to an area that is typically dealt with , and indeed should be dealt with , by the Member States themselves .
We encourage the Commission to promote using the resources and instruments available to it the development of an entrepreneurial culture by simplifying procedures and cutting red tape in order to boost exchanges between universities and businesses .
. Mr President , I should like to start by expressing my gratitude to Mr Cornillet , whose initiative we have to thank for the fact that we are discussing this important issue today and shall be adopting a resolution on it tomorrow .
There is a human rights element to this choice .
All these attempts have failed due to the continued reluctance of the Ugandan Government to cooperate in capturing this criminal , for whom the ICC has issued an international arrest warrant .
( FR ) Mr President , thank you for this clever question .
It is based on the needs of the civilian populations and allocated solely in proportion to these needs .
The importance of the family is also not sufficiently emphasised , as my colleague Mrs Záborská has said .
The Commission is receiving numerous complaints about maladministration .
We should not forget that women form the majority of our population .
This is the purpose of our resolution directed at the General Assembly of the United Nations .
The vote will take place today at 12 noon .
That is why I now believe that , as soon as the Czechs verify their situation , we should move forward .
And it is to be feared that as well as being exceptionally grave , it will be exceptionally long .
It is a pity this has not been done and that transparency in this material has been a little forced .
The framework decision on combating the exploitation of children and child pornography relates to this whole area .
Mr Zalm , I would urge you , though , to display the same level of honesty and flexibility , and refrain from saying that you will be clarifying and improving the statute .
Although these are different sectors , the economic and social consequences will be identical , hence the reason for our opposition .
I would like especially and sincerely to thank the Committee on Culture for its efforts to accelerate the procedure , and the rapporteur , Mr Takkula , for his excellent work and cooperation .
Each Member State is free to grant such rights to nationals of third countries and offer such solutions to its residents .
We must therefore make two demands at European level .
What we seek is equal treatment for foreign service suppliers in some sectors , not a commitment to deregulate markets or privatise existing operators .
Honourable Members , I think that the fact that we have opened up this chapter and given a European dimension to the question of pensions will give the governments in all the Member States the support and backing they need in order to bring about sustainable reform , taking account of the economic and , more importantly , the social dimension .
I believe the sources you mentioned are relevant and should therefore be taken into account when collecting data and estimates which are really important for this . You will understand that in my present capacity I cannot and may not comment on the political opinion of a Member State &apos;s Head of Government .
At this time of the year we do not want to see more people on the streets .
These criteria are open .
He was fishing but he had not caught any fish .
Both sites were selected on unknown criteria .
An interpretation clarifying primary legislation is acceptable , but not its extension .
President Ahmadinejad took office on 3 August 2005 , since which time the situation has deteriorated .
( Applause )
Many of the cross @-@ border issues for which the EU could be useful are not tackled , and many of the funds disappear into shadowy spending and fraud .
Those responsible for the brutal killing of Robert McCartney should admit to what they did in a court of law .
We also wish to ask the Member States to take decisive action with adequate financial resources to combat the trafficking of human beings through judicial and police cooperation , paying particular attention to the most vulnerable - women and children - and ensuring that they have access to health care and education .
Secondly , the criteria must be clear .
Proposal for a Council Decision concerning the Community position within the Association Council on the association of Slovenia to Community programmes in the field of research , technological development and demonstration ( 1998 @-@ 2002 ) and to programmes for research and training activities ( 1998 @-@ 2002 ) ( COM ( 99 ) 0046 - C4 @-@ 0121 / 99 @-@ 99 / 0046 ( CNS ) ) ( Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy )
These events took place on the eve of the tragic anniversary of 6 September 1955 when a major pogrom was carried out against the Patriarchate and the Greeks of Istanbul .
It emphasises that the strengthening of the OSCE should not come at the price of weakening the existing institutions and mechanisms or affecting their independence , when they have not yet been reformed or alternatives have not yet been agreed , particularly as regards the work of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights ( ODIHR ) .
For my part , I think it is a terrible document .
Indeed , I have many friends of Bangladeshi origin in London and I follow the political situation there very closely .
We have freedom of movement from North Africa , we simply do not recognise it .
We cannot therefore support it .
European integration is an irreversible fact .
Additionally , I would like to thank the French government for reaching a compromise and for also finally convincing Spain that this legislation must be given the green light .
The exchange @-@ rate mechanism is essential if we are to prevent currency fluctuations in non @-@ participating countries and to protect the single market .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by thanking Commissioner Monti for responding at such short notice .
The reasons that make it necessary and useful to use and exchange Passenger Name Record ( PNR ) data with third countries for security purposes need to be made transparent and understandable .
I was recently at the International Broadcasting Exhibition in Berlin , where I could see very well how consumer habits in this area are changing , and that nowadays the technical means of transmission can no longer be decisive when it comes to deciding which is the right way to draft laws for a media service .
However , I would be worried if the countries that support the 1 % succeeded during the ongoing discussions on the financial framework , because then we would not have enough money to realise our vision of a common rural development policy .
Dare we hope that we shall have a European employment policy after the Vienna Summit ?
Europarty support blurs democracy .
The whole information and communications technology sector has to be regulated until the markets are fully competitive .
I believe that we should place greater emphasis on consumers receiving clear information about the preservative content in food products purchased .
We must recognise this wonderful achievement .
The answer is to send a signal at second reading , so that the rapporteur and our colleagues of all parties have the strongest possible negotiating position when we come to one of the most serious processes of conciliation we have ever had in this Parliament .
As its legislative functions are limited , this responsibility essentially falls under Article 265 on the failure to act .
Moreover , the European Community and its Member States noted in their declaration of 21 September 2005 that the Union would be monitoring whether the additional protocol was being applied to all EU Member States without restriction and without discrimination and would make an assessment of the matter in 2006 .
We must at long last speak out to condemn this madness .
Hazardous stabilisers in the form of heavy metals such as lead and cadmium must be banned as soon as possible .
The question is : do we want to internalise that in the cost price , do we want the polluter to pay ?
I also note with interest the compromise amendments on free legal assistance .
Here , too , there is a broad agreement and this , too , will be helpful as we continue in our work .
We welcome the Commissioner ’ s intention to make Member States ’ budget policies more transparent and more binding , not least as a result of the publicity that regular reports to the European Parliament and debates on them will attract .
I have voted for the report , but the EU &apos;s regional and structural policy must be designed so as to stop this unfortunate development .
I therefore support the remedial measures proposed in the report aimed at demographic renewal , lengthening the period of professional activity , guaranteeing high @-@ quality social care and promoting solidarity between the generations .
Mr President , thank you for your statement .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Kósáné Kovács , on behalf of the Commission for the excellent report that has been presented by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
Is the EU about bridges or barriers ?
Some of these - and a number of speakers have already made the same point - have admittedly focused too much on percentages and planning .
We will have plenty of time to discuss this report before it comes back to Parliament .
Mr Adamou described withdrawal as a significant step , but recognised the equally significant challenges ahead .
Nevertheless , we need to resolve the issue of milk quotas without creating another problem in the process .
Mr President , basically , the issue we are now debating concerns our credibility as parliamentarians .
However , we believe that the proposals it contains to give Europol operational powers and to establish a European public prosecutor are incompatible with what has already been laid down in this area .
In its negotiations with the European Union , Slovenia attempted to use its very best people .
The fact that we have 18 million unemployed is an absolute tragedy but I would put it to you that if we had loose monetary policy without the completion of the internal market , given the reality of the global market competition to which Mr McCartin referred , this figure would be higher .
It also has to be recognised that the ECB &apos; s policy has very consistently been different from that of the US Federal Reserve Bank .
Dozens of Albanians and Tunisians die en route to Italy .
The citizen expects to be informed about results , not about what the Union is planning or intending to do .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , I will try not to ask a hypothetical question . Instead , I wish to ask about your personal views .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have with me twenty pages of notes on a matter which , you will agree , is far more important .
( Parliament agreed to urgent procedure )
The pipelines are filled with meat , so there is an imbalance on the input and output in the sector and therefore the management committee decided last Thursday to introduce a private storage that I hope will help the problems in the pigmeat sector .
The fifth condition is that the official language of the third country must be English , which it is in the case of South Africa , Australia and the USA .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I too should like to take this opportunity to express my particular thanks to Mr Nassauer for having drafted this report , and to congratulate him on it .
All this should be made part of a long @-@ term aim , namely an association agreement with Ukraine .
This is the case of many national audit authorities , not only in France , but in other Member States .
Only if the Security Council so finds , and only if it resolves that action is to be taken , may action lawfully occur .
On an entirely different point , I would also like to support what some of the previous speakers have said : if the war on terror is to be legitimate , it should not involve flouting the most basic rights .
In this event , we are heading from recycling systems which are in working order towards unresolved waste problems .
G20 was clear .
It is also unacceptable that a Member State can inspect its fishing vessels in the exclusive economic zone of any other Member State , without the latter &apos;s authorisation .
Businesses in Europe must remain competitive .
Commission , I entirely agree with what you have repeatedly said , namely that the European railway system needs to be reformed .
We also support the call for the Commission to take steps to ensure that the composition of both this committee and the planned new advisory committee on public / private partnerships is balanced , including trade unionists and representatives of the business community , in particular , SMEs , and that they work in a transparent manner .
The effects of these acid deposits are dependent in particular on the characteristics and the sensitivity of receivers and , of course , on the quantity of the deposits .
Among the matters on the Lisbon agenda , we have focused , in particular , on the issue of employment and competitiveness in order to underline once again the need to pursue structural reforms .
Such a development would lead to a significant advance as far as the presence of the international community in Bosnia Herzegovina is concerned .
Application of Directive 2004 / 38 / EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their families to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States ( debate )
This report aims to identify the modern challenges , especially in terms of living standards , faced by EU citizens living in urban areas .
Nobody underestimates consumers &apos; rights to press their claims .
Overall , the Commission wishes to amend the existing cod recovery plan in order to make it more complete , updated to recent developments , simpler , more efficient and easier to implement , monitor and control .
Maternity protection also needs strengthening .
The proposed changes include : modernising the NAFO structure ( merging the General Council and the Fisheries Commission into a single body ) , reforming the system of contributions to the budget , introducing clear guidelines on the rights and obligations of NAFO contracting parties , changes to the decision @-@ making process and the introduction of a new conflict resolution procedure , in order to resolve disputes in an effective manner , which will benefit European Union interests .
First of all , as others have already mentioned , there is the protection and the rights of the Serbian minority in Kosovo .
It is therefore only fair that they should be given a strengthened role to play now that we are reviewing European forms of governance .
The use of Turkish as a new official language will require preparations , and we will not be able to get everything done by 1 May .
My group insists that all the regulations concerning Kosovo must be in line with international law and must be agreed with all the parties involved , including Serbia .
The rapporteur recognises that the supply of cod in the fishing ports on the east coast of the Irish and North Sea has declined dramatically in the last ten years .
We do not even have the right to present an amended proposal , we just participate in the debate .
Through the ENP , the Union is ready to reinforce its lasting commitment to supporting democratic development in Belarus .
We will try to ensure that the Council is here .
I for one would never let a child of mine of that age have access to one .
Last week was great : we had the Interparliamentary Forum , the Commission produced a paper , Estonia ratified the Constitution , Finland gave a clear signal that it would ratify and Mrs Merkel gave a great speech .
We therefore advocate an interinstitutional agreement relating to a written legal framework for the EU ’ s language arrangements .
The Council has recognized this in the common position and , although the text is clearly not perfect , it represents a considerable advance in the field of health and safety .
It was the first time ever that the multilateral aspect had been addressed directly .
This is a disgrace for Member States .
We are taking considerable risks by wishing to centralise currency issuing in a Europe which is in all other respects pluralistic and diverse in its economic characteristics .
Six million Jews were murdered in the Second World War here in Europe .
Many people were killed .
Commissioner , I believe that you could send this signal .
This will be very welcome to those farmers whose livelihood has been very precarious over the last eight or nine months .
It would , however , be foolish not to look beyond our Union , because the virus will not be careful to stay within our outside borders .
I think this motion is a good one .
It also means , however , that the Member States must be prepared to take a stand on important proposals , such as the most recent one to impose penalties in connection with deliberate discharges of oil .
I do not intend to judge whether this is good or bad for us in the final analysis .
In conclusion , I want to declare that the proposal would support housing , support the SMEs and save jobs , which is fully in line with the European Economic Recovery Plan .
Europe needs a common immigration and asylum policy characterised by humanitarianism .
Many of the atrocities in the Balkans that we spoke of earlier and much of the racism and antisemitism is because communities everywhere have not been allowed the ability , in line with the concept of subsidiarity , to develop within their own communities the democracy that people need everywhere if they are to evolve and create within their own regions and nations , the social rights , justice , respect for minorities , coexistence of different people and respect for every race and people .
Mr President , China , an immutable yet changing country , has once again recently given us an example of its contradictions and its difficulties .
Mr President , the Haug Report , which is before this House , presents an eminently political problem , the problem of financing the Union by means of its own resources .
Parliament &apos;s approach was to enhance as much as possible the Community aspect of customs cooperation , the quality of controls and , as I have already mentioned , the essential computerization of systems .
Thank you , Mr President .
Incentive measures must not be coercion measures .
Transparency goes without saying for national central banks , and should also be the case for the European Central Bank .
We would have therefore created a competing institution , existing beside the Convention , made up of representatives of the institutions .
Many students , teachers , young people , professors and freelance workers will thus have an opportunity to make connections , via networks with their colleagues in the Member States .
However , the arguments that excessively lengthy negotiations with the Council are putting existing projects - projects which are already up and running - at risk have persuaded me otherwise .
Such cases relate to the Posting of Workers Directive and its implementation and to the public procurement directives .
As regards taxation , state aid , the Structural Funds and defending our traditional products , practical measures characterised by daring and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency .
It is still too early to establish the content of a new resolution . It is crucial , however , for an inspection regime that is effective and credible to be established .
After all , we need to take the global terrorist threat most seriously .
I agree with what the President @-@ in @-@ Office has said about the value of these tools and place on the record my welcome for the Irish presidency programme in this respect .
The political crisis that followed the legislative elections of June 2009 in Albania showed all of us that this country can still fall prey to serious difficulties .
I will give you two specific examples .
Why is it that some people and some Member States insist on carrying out their own ratification procedures ?
With 2004 very much in mind , it is vital that we address the issues of slow response and delays to the implementation of the existing TENs projects .
What has been happening in the past few weeks with the abolition of securities for certain products and the introduction of individual sureties for sensitive products is already ruining some firms , and this is surely not what anyone here wants .
There are other examples - as we have heard from around the floor , from other countries - where I am sure we could do the same .
The more ambitious the free trade agreement , the greater the economic benefits that will accrue to each party - the European Union and India .
A few days ago , I was again asked why I keep reverting to fishing matters , despite the fact that my constituency has nothing to do with the sea . But , may I say in passing , we do have large quantities of the best trout in the world .
The Commission talks in one place about a voluntary minimum quality standard and in another place about a modular system that needs to be worked out by 2003 and which would allow people to combine different educational and vocational training establishments .
Thanks are due for the fact that Mr Kacin &apos;s proposed amendments give an objective picture of the inter @-@ ethnic processes in Vojvodina , of the atrocities that still persist , and of the need to legislate on the legal status of the National Councils , the need for proportional representation of minorities in the police force and the judicial system , and the need to maintain minority radio broadcasting and funding for it .
We will certainly vote against these funds and this financial perspective , which is a fatal perspective for Europe and its dignity .
Last weekend in Ireland the announcement by Dell , that it was relocating 2 000 jobs , came as a body @-@ blow to the community in the Mid @-@ West and West of Ireland .
One of the ways in which we can help is to promote democracy , the rule of law , counter @-@ terrorism policies and cooperation in the region and also in this specific country .
All of this is lacking , and no country wants to introduce taxation .
That was the last item on the agenda .
As far as the management itself is concerned , we decided last year to appoint four women to senior management level , which will therefore begin to correct this imbalance .
Motion for a resolution ( B5 @-@ 0813 / 2001 )
Mr President , I firstly have to express my regret that the group of visitors I invited are not among our spectators today as their journey here has been held up on French roads .
Everyone knows that this is not the way heroes behave .
Our question concerns a specific nuclear power plant which the Turkish Government wishes to establish in an earthquake @-@ prone area and we are correlating this issue directly with that of the terrible earthquake which took place in Turkey .
We believe that improved basic conditions for work should exist , but not by the means mentioned just now by Mr Goebbels , namely through increasing people ’ s working time .
I should like to explain on behalf of my Austrian colleagues in the VP , and also for Mr Frischenschlager in the Liberals , why we rejected the eight hour clause .
However , as required by Regulation ( EC ) No 1 / 2003 , the Commission publishes all its decisions in due course .
This is an important issue and I want to thank the Commission for presenting the budget in the new format , whatever problems we have with it .
They have very good reasons for doing so .
The post of Commissioner is a political post for which we need people capable of carrying out their duties with complete independence and with an acute sense of the European dimension and interest , and not any individual interest .
In light of what I have said , I reiterate my hope that the Commission will set out the appropriate strategies in short order .
Admittedly , both you and we in Parliament can be happy with the result .
It is therefore important for the development of Europe ’ s economy that funding earmarked for the programme making digital content more accessible be raised from EUR 135 million to EUR 149 million .
Even if we were to adopt a thousand reports like the Gaubert report , containing new repressive measures against Europeans who avail themselves of their right to free expression of opinion in order to voice their dissatisfaction with the situation , it would not make the slightest bit of difference .
We must start work on a document which provides specifically and exclusively for the needs of the mountain regions .
Operation Atalanta has succeeded in providing protection for high @-@ risk cargos by escorting them .
This would be a step in the right direction and a model to follow for other multinational European institutions .
Opinion differs widely on the means to achieve this , however .
It is European citizens at large who need to be informed about the benefits of the euro and we must do more to present the arguments and issues before them .
At the same time , we must , of course , also conduct the arguments of principle concerning the nature and being of the Union .
As a human being I believe - and for a number of years , many of my friends have agreed with my views and feelings - that in modern times there is too much emphasis on the importance of material values .
The vote will take place tomorrow .
Russian society is , more than ever , hostage to a propagandist press and is retreating into dangerous nationalism .
To put an end once and for all to the temptation to construct ideologies from this , whereby the high achievers are sectioned off from the less worthy elements of life , we should in fact take our society forward - at least outside the business world - on the basis that everyone contributes according to his abilities and is cared for according to his needs .
We will do that .
We visited the Aral Sea and saw at first hand the environmental problems that exist .
Our aim is to reduce this dependence on Russian energy sources , but for most Member States - Hungary amongst them - there is no viable medium @-@ term alternative .
We must not just get it right ; but we must also simplify it and make it something that contains an emotional message that people will respond to positively .
My question is simple and straightforward .
We find it regrettable that the European Commission is maintaining the same employment policy guidelines as those adopted for 2010 , so we are maintaining the same critical position as we adopted then .
&lt; empty &gt;
From the data which have so far been available , it is evident that at present the United States of America will not be requesting any additional information apart from the data which passengers already voluntarily provide on flights to the United States of America when filling in the I @-@ 94 form , which is green for those who have a visa system .
Nevertheless , it shows we have got to do a lot better , and that involves cooperation - if I can use that term - with the 15 % pledge enshrined in the Abuja Declaration by the countries themselves .
Mr President , what I have noted today in this House , in particular , is the absence of the Commissioner responsible for the two sectors – agriculture and fisheries – who should be taking the initiative to propose measures to alleviate the negative impact of the rise in oil prices on two sectors which are unquestionably his responsibility .
The entrepreneurial principle should continue to apply wherever possible .
We must take care to avoid the adoption of blanket provisions that cannot be applied in the real world .
Deregulation would adversely affect employment , reduce efficiency , damage &apos; public service &apos; interests , destroy a supportive division of costs between rural and city consumers , and adversely affect the legal employment position of the personnel concerned .
I also have a subsidiary question : will this approval be valid in all EU countries ?
May I conclude my response to the report by thanking the House for facilitating the early adoption of a common position on this important measure which will promote the safety of fishing activities in Community waters and , in particular , the protection of the lives of European fishermen to whom we all as a Community owe so much .
The approach itself is very sensible , but as so often , the devil is in the detail .
That was the reason why it was put back to 28 November .
Despite everything , I thank the rapporteur , Mr Jarzembowski .
Mr President , I should like to express my appreciation to the rapporteur , Mr Jové , for his splendid work and for always being willing to collaborate with members of the Committee on Agriculture .
Political debate in the Member States is currently based on elections to the national parliaments .
President Obama intends to bring an end to such practices and that is something that my group , too , warmly welcomes .
Commissioner Byrne once again informed a fellow Member that the Commission is sensitive to ‘ greater interaction between health systems ’ .
I think that , above and beyond all the polemic , this is due to Parliament ’ s grave concern regarding the future of the textile industry and above all , which is the striking aspect of this matter , due to the perceived lack of foresight on the part of the Commission and of the Member States .
I call for the recovery of organic waste to be given greater emphasis , particularly in this largely agricultural region , for data to be verified , and for a system for exchanging best practices to be established .
Any other material from an animal which does not fall within the definition of specified risk material is fit for human consumption .
We also need consistency .
We are not merely talking about countries such as Norway or Switzerland , but also the United States , Russia , and even Morocco or China .
There is still a long way to go , however , in terms of the internal coordination of macroeconomic policies or of certain structural reforms , which go beyond budgetary coordination , and clearly a long way to go in terms of external coordination .
It is important for Parliament to offer clear answers to crises .
We need to construct a new nation where respect for human rights , the application of justice and the reconstruction of our social fabric are the solid foundations which will allow us to build a society in which the factors which create violence are eradicated for good .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
As I have pointed out on so many occasions in this House , EU agricultural policy is reprehensible because the money is given to the wrong recipients , and often to recipients who are very rich .
in writing . - ( BG ) The budget of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control for the financial year 2009 increased by 25.3 % compared with 2008 .
But secondly - and they are linked - there are real concerns about the selling @-@ out on agriculture in the European Union .
The founding statute of the Court claims that the Court shall only intervene on a subsidiary basis , in cases where the Member States refuse to exercise their sovereign right or are not in a position to do so .
We also support a European arrest warrant .
In the United States , they have an early @-@ warning system to that end .
Therefore we must be on our guard to ensure that the institutional reform is tackled quickly and logically so that we do not waste any time and the enlargement process is not thereby delayed .
This is quite unacceptable , Commissioner .
There has very recently been a conference on Iraq in which this issue has been debated , a series of resolutions have been approved , and this Parliament is incapable of following them up because it prefers to deal with domestic political issues rather than the genuine problems that are currently of concern to humanity .
We need to ensure that we protect the rights of workers who do not have choices and whose agents know that they can exploit that weakness .
We have to recognise the difficulties in obtaining funding for space exploitation , space research , space utilisation .
We can bring them to a conclusion speedily through this Directive on the safety of third @-@ country aircraft , and , ladies and gentlemen , I would like once again to express our condolences for the victims and say that we must continue to work to improve safety in the air sector , firstly , naturally , in European airspace , in relation to aircraft which leave Europe for other places , but also at world level , because , however much information we provide – and naturally we must do so , to increase transparency in the information tour operators give their clients , stating which company is going to provide the transport , stating exactly which companies they work with – this is important and will improve safeguards and information for our citizens and our passengers , and there can be no doubt that we – Europeans or non @-@ Europeans – must fight to improve safety in air traffic and in international civil aviation .
in writing . - I support this report , despite my opposition and disappointment that the former European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia , set up following the recommendations of the Council of Ministers &apos; Consultative Committee on Racism and Xenophobia , where I represented the European Parliament , has now been dissolved into a wider European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights .
Participation in profits ( PEPPER II )
This period revealed all of Europe &apos;s common weaknesses .
We will refer that matter to the President .
This afternoon , less than an hour ago , an American aircraft crashed not far from JFK airport in the Queens area of New York .
We have now reached a stage where many of our fellow citizens no longer believe in what we are doing at European level .
I shall pass on your comments to Mr Hänsch , but I have to say that this is always the complaint on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings .
On analysis of the impact on monetary union of the financial crisis in Asia and Russia , I beg forgiveness but we are not yet operational as a European Central Bank and , therefore , although we have watched and monitored closely the developments there and the impact it has on economic developments in Europe , we do not yet have the authority to do anything about it .
On the other hand , doping is dangerous to the health of the athletes who take recourse to banned substances , often in knowledge of the inherent dangers .
I see , though , that Mr Evans and Mrs Riis @-@ Jørgensen are here , and so we can , anyway , give a repeat of our performance in committee , swapping our positions on this issue .
Muhammad Abbas ’ s ruling Fatah faction would also be hard pushed to meet our level of legitimacy with the legacy of cronyism and corruption .
If the normal rules of order are applied , she was quite out of order in introducing the subject into a debate on a report on road safety .
China , Japan and the Republic of Korea are among the world ’ s top six economies , if the EU is counted as one .
I can say with certainty that nearly every European family has a story to tell about the blighted fates of fathers , brothers or sisters .
I therefore support both this resolution and the European day against the death penalty , but I believe we still have to go a little further in all our work to achieve the abolition of the death penalty .
There are agreements in the Council of Europe about the level of human rights to be guaranteed in Europe at least .
( LT ) European politicians are now breaking a long silence and are describing Russia &apos;s actions in Georgia as disproportionate .
However , we need to be able to fully implement external relations financial instruments .
The surrender of £ 7 billion of our rebate is unacceptable .
The solution rests primarily in transferring decisions on regional and structural policies to the national level .
Once the medicine is developed , it must be delivered to all patients who need it .
Commissioner , as you have pointed out , the European Parliament has also been at the forefront in combatting fraud .
If we had taken the responsibility of allowing a bank to fail , as occurred in the US with Lehman Brothers , the whole of the system would have collapsed .
We should do everything in our power to help the Baha &apos;is to regain the religious freedom that they had before Khomeini seized power , and the freedom to which they should be entitled once again .
The ethnic minorities are becoming increasingly demanding and violent towards the inhabitants and the peacekeeping forces , thus demonstrating the still very evident fragility of local governments , particularly the Albanian Government , which ought to uphold the rights of the political opposition more firmly , and the fragility of relations with the European Union and with some non @-@ governmental organisations .
I can essentially go along with what Pernille Frahm has just said , and we shall also support her amendment which , in spite of everything , does nonetheless mitigate this dreadful piece of legislation we are debating , albeit to no great legal effect , because this is a simple consultation procedure . I have two points to make .
However , this trade union leader strove to defend the rights of more than 38 000 of those modern slaves of globalisation working in the textile industries of South @-@ East Asia .
. I supported Mrs Honeyball ’ s report because I believe it demonstrates the European Parliament ’ s support for the Commission so that this institution can open up a real debate in the Council on the crucial harmonisation of tax in the automobile sector .
The present report also makes it clear how quickly new products can appear on the market and force the legislative authorities to act .
Despite the fact that the reform of the Structural Funds culminated in the 1999 Berlin Summit , which made substantial improvements to the way in which it is run , the experience of the last two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years tells us that there is room for further improvements .
I am very optimistic .
To deny such differences is not to fight for equal rights but rather to fight for the conformity and sameness of both sexes .
Amendment of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 55 / 2008 introducing autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of Moldova (
Parliament sees it as a bad omen that it is not to have wider powers when it comes to legislation and the budget .
In commending to the House approval of this agreement , which we consider to be of great political importance , we consider it incumbent upon us to call on the Macedonian government to monitor carefully the situation with regard to its minorities and the situation with regard to civil rights in general . Macedonia has a population which is complex in its ethnic origins and this government must show a high degree of respect for the complexity of the situation over which it governs .
The submission of the Serbian Government &apos;s replies to the European Commission &apos;s questionnaire , which Prime Minister Cvetković will hand over to Commissioner Füle this month , will be an historic step for the Serbian state and for all its citizens .
The question is whether through this programme , involving ECU 25 m over two years in the first instance - with which a total credit volume of perhaps ECU 1 billion can be achieved - we can actually create a decisive impact on unemployment .
However , the system will still be used outside of our borders and we will import liquid egg or powdered egg from those cages that are banned in the European Union , and producers wonder at the logic of all of that .
Fourthly , the simplified registration procedure should be extended to veterinary homeopathic remedies for food @-@ producing animals .
For this reason , we want to remove these options for further extension of the derogations .
Companies ’ right to sell dangerous gases is more important than political opportunities to combat the greenhouse effect and climate change .
Austria , which has a long external EU border to protect , is particularly aware of the importance of Europol and Schengen and calls for a common approach to asylum and immigration policy .
Therefore , I ask this House to confirm the text in its vote .
I should like to emphasise that our analysis and deliberations have by no means been concluded .
In 2002 alone , EUR 25 million have been allocated for this crisis and an additional EUR 3 million are now in the pipeline for more emergency food aid .
We should therefore all be pleased , since I believe that this is the right approach , as is being demonstrated in the case of the Mediterranean .
By introducing such amendments , the report distances itself in qualitative terms from the initial proposal and therefore deserves our favourable vote .
We have finally been able to reach agreement , having resolved an important issue which was the maximum time limits for deciding on an authorisation , thus eradicating the well @-@ known and paralysing administrative silence due to a lack of decision .
Mr Barrot also spoke about the need to recognise the external costs of transport and Mr Albertini spoke about some of the amendments .
Applause
There is no reason to limit its scope .
This might possibly be regulation , but there is no reason at that stage why some form of self- or co @-@ regulation should not be considered as a proper option .
What I am saying is that we will never win the race against China when it comes to cheap labour .
It is also the case , as Mr Medina Ortega has rightly said , that we are engaged at the moment in a legal , and not just a political , process .
How do you think a competitor feels who has just recovered from a serious illness and is sent into the boxing ring ?
With regard to readmission agreements , they should not be used as a possible way of twisting the arms of countries in receipt of development aid by saying that they will only receive development aid and funds or cooperation if they also sign readmission agreements .
&lt; empty &gt;
This year the first railway package came into force with the liberalisation of freight transport , and this evening we will consider the compromise concerning the third railway package , which will introduce further liberalisation , albeit far less ambitiously than we in the ALDE Group would have liked .
We must maintain humanitarian aid and continue the training of North Korean technicians in Europe if only to take this opportunity .
This is what I have done since entering this Parliament , in respect of foodstuffs but also cosmetics .
That is the explanation .
This was the case , for example , regarding the biotechnology group , which I considered appropriate to accept at a certain time .
I really do not think that , even though the rapporteur has shifted somewhat to the right in time to present the report to plenary .
It is not true , therefore , that we have achieved more in essence .
Let us be clear that the Commission ’ s proposed new reform of state aid provides for substantial reductions to the scope in which state aid can be granted .
However , stagnation in the process of democratisation was not all that happened last year , so it is necessary to be critical where progress was not made or where the situation became worse , but also to show that we value the changes for the better .
. The aims of this Commission proposal could not be clearer : to remove the cross @-@ border tax obstacles that not only hamper company cross @-@ border mobility within the European Union , particularly that of multinationals , but also to allow a policy of company restructuring and relocation that favours tax relief or , viewed from another angle , that provides the greatest tax benefits .
A new Europe was born in Pristina , and that Europe has seen the light of day on the threshold of a new century .

For example , there are for the first time specific grants for scientific research and for study and training built into the agreement as well as the amounts of aid offered for general revenue , some of which will find its way - this is always the defence of this kind of system - through the priorities of the relevant government to schools , clinics and development of that nature .
It does not avoid taxation . What it tries to do is avoid double taxation .
Finally , perhaps one of the positive consequences of China &apos;s increasing presence in Africa is this debate and the report that we are going to adopt tomorrow .
There are considerable infrastructure needs , not to mention environmental challenges .
Does the programme outlined to us complement the Interreg IIB Community initiative concerning trans @-@ European energy networks ?
It should not be a matter of which committee of experts is more expert than the other . It should be a matter of broad public consultation and debate in order to establish consensus in our societies as to the future direction and application of new reproductive technologies .
Labelling of GMOs has been improved , although we expect further action by the Commission on this .
Let us base our advice to the electorate on facts .
In questions to the Commission , I have endeavoured to obtain clarity as to what action the Commission plans to take against the use of &apos; false &apos; self @-@ employed workers .
In the Copenhagen Communication , the Commission has addressed these questions by putting forward concrete proposals - proposals that are not only ambitious but also realistic , and will make a significant contribution to the success in Copenhagen that our planet so desperately needs .
This is the eternal truth of all negotiations but the picture has not been so bad .
Let us begin with the concept of freedom of contract : those who buy and sell must respect ethical principles , but also practical , operational ones which underpin the economy . Conditions of contract are one of these fundamental principles governing company sales .
As regards the first point , we thought it best to ask the two candidates which system they preferred .
– Mr President , we are very much in favour of this and support the request for urgent procedure .
That should be the opening that we aim for .
My parliamentary colleagues provided several eyewitness accounts during the January part @-@ session .
We must also call for a change in behaviour with regard to mobile phones by encouraging the use of ear pieces , limiting mobile phone use among children and young people , educating them in safer techniques , monitoring certain marketing campaigns , and having operators and electricity companies share base stations and masts .
Every year , 1.4 million citizens living in Europe develop some type of dementia .
I welcome the fact that the Czech Presidency has specified the energy issue as a priority .
We feel that confidence in the Convention is , in fact , growing , because , in addition to the now traditional Community institutions , it also encompasses national institutions , in other words , the governments and the parliaments of the Member States and of the candidate countries .
Since the Foreign Affairs Conference of May 2005 in Luxembourg , we have succeeded in reaching joint conclusions in all the Euro @-@ Mediterranean ministerial meetings .
We also must respond to the call for greater environmental protection by ensuring farmers have an opportunity to participate in agri @-@ environmental schemes with a goal of a majority of farmland being covered by such a scheme over the period of the next reform .
We voted on 12 amendments with one vote .
Staying with the positives , I also very much welcome the fact that , in its Green Paper , the Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection has also placed a definite emphasis on the issue of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms . That is very different to the White Paper from the Directorate General for Competition , which was also debated in this House yesterday and which has so far completely ignored the possibility of out @-@ of @-@ court dispute resolution mechanisms .

Our programme specifically mentions the possibility of reviewing the transition periods , which limit the free movement of workers from the new Member States .
The public and private benefits include higher employability , increased work productivity , lower unemployment benefit expenditure , lower social benefits expenditure and lower early retirement .
It also says that there would be a flight of capital from Europe .
Meanwhile , Israel does not respect the Accords signed with the representatives of the Palestinian people .
In contrast , the huge spread of the Internet , and the films and information which it disseminates , offers a genuinely independent , pluralistic media environment free of monopolies and cartels .
Clearly , Mr Prodi had in mind the replacement of an ancient hegemony with a new economic one .
I can tell this House that we are talking about an amount of ECU 16.6 million which is at the very least under a question mark from the Court of Auditors .
It is not only a vital cog in the economic wheel but also a store of values and ideals ; and if the currency under discussion is the euro , these considerations take on a far deeper meaning .
. Thank you very much , Mr Helmer , for those constructive thoughts .
My group tabled an amendment today for that to be withdrawn , but it just failed to go through .
Migration has been and remains a particularly important issue and will also be dealt with by the Council , on the basis of a number of specific cases .
Thirdly – as I pointed out in my initial speech – the Commission carefully considered all these issues , what this means for the future economic governance of the Union , and we will prepare an initiative to improve it within the framework of the current Treaty .
I wonder if his own MEPs do .
We also need to spend more on European film production , because we need to give our citizens a better understanding of the European narrative and European visions of Europe &apos;s history and future .
Sweden does , however , have the right to take action against misleading advertising broadcast by the same TV companies .
So this debate has not come about all of a sudden : it has not just landed in our laps , we have been considering it for years , and you , in Parliament , have been discussing it for years .
We all know that , after the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol , it is extremely important to have a clear and effective monitoring mechanism for CO2 and other greenhouse gases .
Certainly , we can express regret that the increased rights are entering into force in a limited way , and also at that fact that the entire package of additional passenger &apos;s rights in cities and on regional routes will , in the majority of countries , not be guaranteed for 15 years at the earliest .
It strikes me as impossible at the moment , though , to make exact predictions about the expected effects on employment .
Mr President , the regulation on the addition of vitamins and minerals and certain other substances to food is a most important piece of legislation and has a very significant bearing on the safety and wellbeing of consumers in the EU .
Otherwise we have the weapon of article 141 , namely that of bringing a vote of no confidence , preferably after the summer holidays , if the Commission does not live up to what it promised and to the wishes we have expressed .
Could I put that point to you ?
I find the behaviour of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , in pulling out of the compromise and going through the entire report again , scattering amendments everywhere , distressing and regrettable .
By now the majority of the issues - including the SoKo Bunda and Pannonia affairs involving Hungarian workers in Germany - have been resolved , court decisions have stopped the German authorities &apos; action and there are even lawsuits for damages underway .
I know that there is some interest in Parliament in the rather difficult question of the trial of suspected pirates who have been arrested and apprehended by Atalanta units .
Besides their principal use , hops are also used in naturopathy owing to the calmative effect of their constituents .
Mr President , our industry is important to our economy , but also frequently causes air , water and soil pollution .
It is , however , the social effects of such measures that give me cause for concern .
Every nation has the right to enact regulations to ensure that taxes are imposed efficiently with the assent of the people &apos;s representatives .
Precisely because they have been well aware of this risk , the Commission , Parliament and the Heads of State and Government decided to get involved in the debate from the very beginning and to implement in good time information campaigns on the Constitution which , while respecting the national specificities of each Member State , would inform the citizens and encourage them to take part in the debate and the referendums .
Just as we condemn the trials against Kosovars held in custody in Serbia , we welcome the reopening of the proceedings in the case of Flora Brovina , which has previously been the subject of resolutions adopted by this House .
We are happy to note that , but progress will not be sustained unless there is equality for all its citizens , and particularly the weaker ones .
Mr President , as the Ohrid Agreement imposes very stringent conditions on Macedonia as regards the protection of minorities , I would ask that we avoid applying double standards , which I rather think we risk doing .
The agreement must not entail detrimental consequences for the fisheries and the population in Mozambique either .
It is the case today for the regulation on mobile telephone roaming charges .
We hope that a means will be found for supporting such meetings .
The Commission welcomed this provision .
I am pleased that my proposals for amendments to this effect , backed unanimously by the Committee on the Environment , have now also been adopted by the European Parliament .
After 11 September , the United States , although undeniably bound up in what is , not least , a political web of interests with the oil @-@ producing countries , attacked without hypocrisy the issue of fundamentalist terrorism , declaring out and out war on the many @-@ headed hydra of Al @-@ Qaeda .
Finally , I must emphasise integration capacity .
I voted for Amendment 29 , where it states that compensation must be according to national law .
( BG ) Mr President , Commissioner , we are discussing an extremely important directive , which will provide an opportunity to resolve issues which are still controversial in the area of non @-@ discrimination .
In what country should he , as a fund member , apply for unemployment benefit ?
The fact that a harmonized approach to environmental taxation in different countries is now being considered and must be considered , will mean that those countries that have already voluntarily imposed environmental taxes will no longer have to bear the pressure that presently comes from industry , which claims that they are freely giving away a competitive edge to their competitors .
Indeed , I understand that , currently , such an action has been instigated by a group of complainants before UK courts .
What doctrines do they involve ?
That is the conclusion which we too believe should be drawn from the unsuccessful negotiations in Seattle .
There are important negotiations under way , Commissioner , which will have a positive outcome , or at least we can still be hopeful of this .
I believe we must have the courage to say that some people , who have a good understanding of Islam , have denounced the current situation in Afghanistan . By invoking Western values we must not deny this truth , which is that a certain number of men and women who are devoted to Islam oppose the events which are unfolding today in Afghanistan .
Madam President , first of all , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for this report , which continues the efforts of this Parliament to address the problem of illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing .
I was at a lunch in a private room in a restaurant in Istanbul where a bishop was frightened of pronouncing grace because it was a risky procedure .
I am also , of course , able to approve the additional objectives proposed by the Commission in its communication on sustainable development prior to the Gothenburg Summit , that is to say Amendments Nos 11 , 15 , 16 and 27 . That is , however , on condition that they faithfully reflect our communication .
( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I personally was in Darfur and I was also in neighbouring Chad with Mr Ribeiro e Castro and I can therefore fully support what he has said .
I am delighted by Parliament ’ s initiatives to insist on this issue and to provide the modifications which allow it to be included directly into our Directive .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I agree : mercury is highly toxic .
Before the previous agreement came to an end , I made contact with Morocco with a view to concluding a new fisheries agreement .
Stage 4 would allow a European airline to fly from A to B within Canada .
In general terms , I must say to Mr Harbour that we have provided ourselves with Rules of Procedure - approved a few weeks ago - and that these Rules regulate practically everything .
It is disgraceful that Taiwan , a fully @-@ fledged democracy since 1987 , is made a pariah by EU governments which claim to represent democratic values .
( HU ) As a Member representing the Hungarian Democratic Forum ( Magyar Demokrata Fórum - MDF ) , I will be using my vote to support both of these draft legislative texts providing for stricter regulations and greater control concerning the use of plant protection products .
The synthesis report by its nature covers a wide area of the Commission &apos;s activity .
When it joined the EU , Sweden was granted a derogation authorising it to retain its superior standards of labelling for certain dangerous substances , including carcinogenic agents .
Firstly , a European Union diplomatic service , not an inter @-@ governmental service , and this means an assurance that 60 % of posts will be appointed by the European Union .
Yet I do not think our work ends there .
The ELDR Group will stick to her original &apos; no @-@ amendment &apos; line .
In any case , I would like to state quite clearly that there definitely is a legal basis for this .
This will enable us to pursue our objectives in the negotiations on geographical information and in the agricultural negotiations , and also in the TRIPS negotiations .
I trust that the amendment before us will be interpreted in this way , if it is adopted .
Ladies and gentlemen , what we are talking about is improving security of supply and the functioning of the internal energy market and , therefore , of strengthening the European Union from the point of view not just of guarantees to consumers but also of its economic capacities .
I would therefore have liked the proposal , in its three parts , to be sent back to the Committee on Budgetary Control .
Sewage sludge contains heavy metals , including considerable quantities of cadmium and because of this , in my own home country , and in the Nordic countries generally , this sludge may not be spread on the fields at all , because cadmium gets into the food chain and thereby enters the human body .
That is a good strategy - communicating the added value of Europe at the local , regional , European and global levels .
Expectations that a European system would be immediately established go much too far and would not even be compatible with the political objectives of the action plan .
Mr President , when we first discussed the issue of corporate governance following the high @-@ level group &apos;s report , it was in the context of Enron and the WorldCom scandals .
Approaches to combating soil degradation must include a strategy for soil conservation by focusing greater attention on the maintenance of hydraulic systems used in agriculture and on afforestation programmes .
Minister Fayyad has confirmed that with our latest help he has succeeded in consolidating public @-@ sector revenues and there is much greater budgetary transparency with monthly budget execution reports available , even on the Internet .
This is not a CO2 tax directive .
As Commissioner Ferrero @-@ Waldner has said , it will be a sui generis entity but , at the same time , it is worth recalling Mr Brok &apos;s statement that the fundamental principles which should apply in the creation of this service , alongside effectiveness , are transparency and a democratic mandate .
This is its great merit , and not any provision on its reform .
I also welcome the fact that we have condemned what is probably a disproportionate reaction on the part of Israel and have rightly indicated that this is not the way to secure peace because , on the contrary , it puts peace at risk .
We believe the Council and Commission must monitor the progress of privatisation very carefully .
Additional Community programmes and pious hopes from the many NGOs will achieve nothing .
I am convinced that cooperation on economic stability and a common currency is the most important contribution that the EU can make towards the creation of better conditions under which we can all be more competitive , achieve greater growth and thus create new jobs .
Closure of the sitting
And it is unfortunately not the Treaty of Amsterdam which is going to advance this unhappy situation , on the grounds of article 128 , as Carole Tongue has clearly said .
The flooding of the Danube can be mentioned by way of example .
We do not do this enough , that is true , even though , in my opinion , a great deal of progress has been made in this area .
I fully agree that there is a concern relating to the high @-@ risk offals and that is why I will be bringing forward proposals relating to the removal of SRMs .
Kinshasa now has more than seven million inhabitants , of which not many more than one million have access to sanitation or safe sewage treatment .
The European Parliament has always supported the FRONTEX agency since its creation , especially in terms of providing financial resources .
To do that , however , we really must understand subsidiarity , which remains the most important principle of federalism .
The subjects are already laid down in the current regulation and we want to vote on these points again today .
First , the social situation of artists : I agree with the fact that we should work out an appropriate legal framework in the areas of tax , labour and social security for artists and performers .
The European Commission has in its hands a key to regaining the public &apos;s confidence .
The report itself should also be a lesson to us all within the European Union institutions .
The other point I want to make is that 95 % of fatal traffic accidents actually take place on the roads .
As a woman , I am delighted to see you in office .
Madam President , the only thing I can say in under a minute is that I am thoroughly in favour of the International Criminal Court , but I shall say one more thing .
When it comes to looking at the budget for 2001 , the European Parliament must ensure that this commitment is translated into action .
The EC Regulation entered into force on 10 March and its annual review is due to take place at the end of this month .
The binding nature of the agreement has been reinforced in the revised text since it is now specified that the rulings of the Arbitration Tribunal are binding on the parties .
Mr President , I should like to begin by congratulating the Commission on its proposal , which I feel is a successful attempt to combat the pollution that is still being caused by vessels dumping their waste at sea .
I am afraid I cannot guarantee that .
It is up to us to succeed where others have for so long failed .
This entails Member States considering a review of their livestock rearing technologies and replacing old technologies with other , state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art and high @-@ performance technologies , which take into account the animals &apos; physiological needs and allow their productive biological potential to be utilised in ideal conditions , also resulting in much better food safety .
Those small and medium @-@ sized enterprises create nine out of ten new jobs .
Regarding the matter of interchangeability between these two categories , I might point out that in the course of the debate on the next report we will discuss how those funds that were not required in the agricultural sector - i.e. in the 1A categories , in respect of market regulation measures - on account of price and market trends , can be re @-@ allocated and made available for other measures .
We are also able to propose that the Dublin agency and the Thessaloniki agency be granted discharge .
Indeed , I find the vote which took place on the immunity of Mr Dell &apos;Utri , a gentlemen who was not even a Member of Parliament at the time of the alleged offence , wholly unconvincing , for the votes cast in a parliament are always politically motivated .
Luckily , there are some Member States where youth unemployment is low , but the European average is too high .
Madam President , Commissioner , from an Irish point of view I welcome the compensation clause and the solidarity fund because Irish football clubs are the cradle for many young footballers who go on to play in the English premiership and beyond .
On the question of data collection and the dissemination of comparable data , we know perfectly well that there is also a deficiency here .
Even then , it was clear that some bodies would have to undergo a process of change .
How can they legitimately claim to have a mandate for giving away all this extra taxpayers ’ money , most of which will be used to subsidise projects in eastern European countries , at the expense of under @-@ funding our own domestic infrastructure ?
( The President cut the speaker off )
How can you believe for one moment that , with a foreign policy determined by majority voting , that the special relationship between France and Quebec would have any weight compared with so @-@ called &apos; global &apos; European interests ?
The suspension of the talks may provide an opportunity for reviewing the Commission ’ s negotiating mandate , which should concentrate on : 1 ) reforming the WTO to make it more transparent , more inclusive and more democratic , embedded within the UN system , and bound in its decision @-@ making by the framework of international law ; 2 ) reviewing the three main agreements now on the agenda : agriculture , intellectual property and services ; 3 ) providing a binding frame of reference for the activities of transnational companies ; 4 ) making respect for the rights of peoples a condition of free trade , by ensuring that the human rights clause , as approved by Parliament on 14 February , is observed ; 5 ) refusing at bilateral or regional level to sidestep the rules agreed upon at multilateral level , taking the EPA talks with the ACP countries as an example .
Broad public debate together with open , transparent negotiations would be a good starting point .
He has to make proposals so that Europe moves forward and , for the time being , Europe is not moving forward , and it is because of this Presidency .
Your country , Prime Minister , plays an important role in the EU .
We cannot let the burden be borne by just some shoulders : we have to share it , because we are democratic nations .
Because I come from Malta , I am also an observer of the way in which the European Union tries to find a balance between the interests of large countries and those of small ones .
We also propose , irrespective of the solution selected , that provision should be made for a transitional period which will allow all the factors to be adjusted .
This has been the case for a few months , and the origin does not go back a few months , but a few years , when the subprime crisis occurred in the United States .
Mr President , by failing to take the necessary action in good time , the European Union is largely responsible for the extent of the BSE crisis .
It will encourage the motor vehicle industry to invest in the technology to make cars greener and to help to protect our environment .
Where I come from we have a saying to the effect that when two tortoises fight they know where they hurt each other .
This type of measure would not only not provide a solution , but would be a mistake , at least from the following points of view .
Mainstreaming health concerns in other policies is indeed a key principle of our strategy , and we are currently exploring synergies on a wide range of issues between these two policy areas .
I find it difficult to understand the Commission &apos;s action for two reasons .
Thirdly , the ECB is mistaken in its interpretation of the inflation criterion applied in assessing how prepared new Member States are for entry into the euro zone .
Given the growing importance of this partnership it seems appropriate that Korea should be added to the three other partners with which the EU has agreements concerning cooperation on anti @-@ competitive action .
As far as T2S is concerned , we have put into place a governance model for the development phase which seeks to involve all stakeholders through the creation of an Advisory Group on T2S where market players are well represented .
As such , you have probably been - inadvertently , otherwise it would have been common knowledge - the best campaigner for the &apos; no &apos; vote of the French and Dutch people on the European Constitutional Treaty , and we thank you for it .
We should return to and revise this directive within three to four years , in the light of whatever changes may take place .
In committee we also expressed the need to guarantee the planning and implementation of the Structural Funds in all its objectives and to promote the principle of equal opportunities , but in a balanced way .
The first is the ports structure and related matters .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
in writing . - Atanas Paparizov &apos;s report on conditions for access to the natural gas transmission networks will facilitate the integration of the EU internal gas market .

She has made every possible effort so that the three institutions might find a compromise that could be adopted at first reading .
This must not lead to developments which conflict with the aims of revising fishing capacity .
On Monday , 28 September , more than 100 people were killed in Conakry , Guinea , when members of the Guinean security forces shot into crowds of demonstrators .
No wonder passenger numbers and goods figures are falling .
Nobody doubts the importance of preparing the European public for the demands of a society based on information , knowledge , and new communications technologies as strategic weapons , in order to emerge victorious in the future , generating employment with higher @-@ quality work and higher pay .
These must be measures that can be adopted and upheld in the short , medium and long term .
That concession of competences varies from one State to another and , furthermore , they vary greatly in many countries .
This is crucial for enlargement too .
Please allow me , though , to pass over the report and make a few brief comments on competition policy in general .
Along with this objective , which forms the nucleus of our policy , we have always endeavoured , and we still do , to strengthen the productive base , because goods need to be produced before they can be distributed more fairly .
A second point is that a reform is already planned for 2009 .
Mr Papayannakis is undoubtedly aware that this political dialogue did not get far with the Association Council because the fifteen Member States were unable to agree on the political declaration drafted by the European Union to prepare for this political dialogue .
Firstly , whilst I welcome the commitment in the communication to appeal to European enterprises to do more to respect human rights , reflected in paragraphs 55 and 92 of our resolution , I have to say to the Commission that I am disappointed that the Relex DGs appear to have opted out of the draft Green Paper on Corporate Social Responsibility .
Work has begun with a view to improving the quality of data in close coordination with the Member States and with the World Health Organisation in order to provide the Member States with better training instruments .
All too often , we have been under the impression that the process of simplification , which is so crucial , is much like a procession of Echternach .
We find ourselves in a situation whereby , if we are not careful , if we try to deregulate this sector as has been done in others , we will end up killing creation , which is one of our unique assets .
. – Mr President , the Commission should like first of all to thank Mrs Almeida Garrett for her excellent work on the Commission ’ s communication on the operating framework for the regulatory agencies .
A lot has been said about Sweden &apos;s attitude to the whole issue , so perhaps I might pass on one interesting result from a survey published last week of young people in their early teens .
It is a delusion in strategic terms , because the behaviour of immigrants will end up being modelled on that of Europeans ; I am thinking here mainly of the unfortunate tendency to have fewer children in a society which is truly disorientated on all counts .
In relation to this , I would like to ask the following question : do you observe that there is a greater tendency on the part of Member States of the Union in terms of cooperation , and is there also a greater tendency in terms of exchanging with each other the different and very important kinds of information necessary to combat terrorism ?
. Although the Commission ’ s report was well @-@ founded , its recommendations of 6 October no longer required Turkey to recognise the Armenian genocide of 1915 .
Sixty @-@ eight percent of European businesses said that harmonisation in this area is an efficient way of facilitating cross @-@ border sales .
Our enthusiasm must not blind us toward the many problems that come with Malta .
A Europe that faces an impending pensions time bomb must take every step to encourage saving and maximise the return that the people of Europe can obtain on their savings .
3 .
What are you protesting against ?

The result : an efficient , safe , quality service in response to passengers &apos; needs .
The report by the Committee on Petitions is revelatory and enlightening and , of course , it is clear that I totally agree with the proposal to establish a code of best practices , because this will result in our defining uniform methods of treatment and rehabilitation activities .
The European Interest : succeeding in the age of globalisation ( debate )
Focussing now on the amendments , I would like to say that , having examined them in detail , the Commission can accept most of them .
The fifty years for which the data was to be stored have now become three and a half .
We should not forget that it is only fairly recently that the 15 Member States signed up to Amsterdam and I am convinced that , in signing up to Article 13 , they are agreeing to introduce legislation .
Several million trees have been destroyed , the olive and citrus crops have been ruined ; in some cases they have been completely wiped out .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , for over twenty years we have known that the population of Southern Sudan does not want Sharia law imposed by Khartoum .
I know the Commission is probably aware of this .
That is why I believe that we need to redefine the notion of the bushmeat crisis , so that it stands for more than just excessive removal of animals from the wild .
Under no circumstances can a society governed by the rule of law sanction such a Court ruling without action being taken .
Yes , this is my message from my country , from a land that was blessed by the heavens and where all the prophets walked and lived in .
The EU should take account of this and recognise Turkey as an important strategic partner beyond its borders .
The legal system , the rights of citizens , freedoms and values are similar in the Member States of the European Union and Macao .
There is , however , a lack of trust between the two sides which the enlargement of the European Union has exacerbated rather than reversed .
I am also reassured by the President of the World Bank , who is of the same opinion .
The European Union , through the experience of its Member States and experts and by virtue of this proposal , which has been greatly improved by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , is rising to the challenge of assisting Member States in public health .
( Interruption by the President )
We are pleased that the environmental report bears a green handprint , especially when it comes to nanotechnology .
However , there are other points in the resolution with which I would not agree .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , Members of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , the environment is a broad field ; all human life on our continent is dependent on both air and water , and groundwater is among the most important and most vulnerable resources that we humans possess .
In this respect I would like to draw your attention to a recently launched call for proposals for grants to non @-@ state actors and local authorities in Iran .
Madam President , Mr Falconer is absolutely right that there is no obligation for a Member to take part in a vote .
It can lead to the creation of more jobs and our goal must be to find work for people .
The part @-@ session in Brussels will be the first one held under the new rules .
Had they been adopted , these amendments would have considerably limited the use of such devices and would have made many platforms already installed in public places and private dwellings in our countries unusable without valid safety grounds .
Top priority must attach to the real Community policies .
Mr President , I wish to repeat my thanks and say that I hope that we will soon conclude the handling of this directive , which will allow the Committee for Standardisation to carry out its work correctly .
Allow me to make a few remarks .
So pensioners are responsible for everything that goes wrong !
I hope that immigration policies that respect human rights and fundamental freedoms , and that ensure equal treatment for immigrants , will be promoted in Seville .
Implementation requires more than legislative action .
The victims of the terrorist attacks require us to stand united .
Agriculture is not simply one more economic activity .
Trapped in a Treaty of Nice that is too constricting , from which it cannot escape , Europe is not ready for further enlargement .
Today , the European Union is removing a major barrier to further development of the freedom of movement of persons within the European Union .
It is therefore impossible to say at this stage what the Council ’ s position will be when the debate is closed .
The key priorities for the European Union at this time include : the completion of the Financial Services Action Plan so as to guarantee a greater level of competition amongst the financial institutions operating within the 25 Member States of the EU , which includes ensuring that retail banking services are available to all EU citizens in the 25 Member States ; facilitating the merging of European banks and the updating of asset management legislation so as to guarantee that fund managers can operate asset funds on a cross @-@ border basis ; the introduction of new legislation to reduce the costs of clearing and settling trading security transactions ; and the introduction of greater competition in the insurance sector .
Mr Martens , there is no question of holding a debate on this .
So I think that what the report says is important : firstly , the safety of people and the environment must have absolute priority ; secondly , full information must be provided to the local authorities and community .
There is a considerable level of responsibility here that must fall on the Internet service providers .
Freedom of religion and conscience must apply to everyone equally .
What we need to ensure is that they are treated equally in terms of both trade access and development assistance .
The French Presidency made an attempt to do so , which I welcome .
Let us have some real legislative proposals this time around .
On this issue , their advice may be sought , but such advice must not be determinative in the way that several amendments on this point propose .
We have achieved much with the Amsterdam Treaty .
Representing a small nation , I believe that there are , however , a number of issues that ought to be resolved before the EU begins negotiations with Turkey .
And , with regard to this , it is worth pointing out that Secretary of State Colin Powell set the tone by making the very limiting statement that trade is the driving force of development and that Johannesburg is an important step on the path that lies between Doha and the future .
It is only fair to point out that given the time we had to do this , the committee and the Parliament have worked as effectively and as quickly as we possibly can in what proved to be difficult circumstances so that the money could be released next year for this very important fund .
To the many of you who contributed to this , let me reiterate my gratitude and my appreciation .
This has been true in this case and I must say that all those who participated in this procedure are experiencing some amazement at the ease of this vote given the conciliation difficulties .
The situation seems to be tragically without a solution , and that is why it is the moral obligation of the European Parliament to painstakingly monitor events in the region , and regularly insist on respect for rights which the citizens and human rights organisations in the Russian Federation still cannot enjoy on a day @-@ to @-@ day basis despite official rhetoric .
Set your hand against structural policy , and you put the Community at risk .
However , such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imposed on the two sides of industry without a legal basis .
A lack of economic governance led to decisions being taken under pressure and without any consultation with the European Parliament .
Mr President , I welcome the Cercas report and congratulate the rapporteur on a very balanced approach .
If we want to help democracy to become established there on a lasting basis and win over the people of the region - and here I definitely include the people of Yugoslavia - for the European model , we have to offer them a European prospect .
Since joining the EU , Bulgaria and Romania have taken numerous measures aimed at properly preparing and protecting their borders .
By foregoing EUR 600 million of credits available to finance ITER against a backdrop of crisis where European public money is scarce , the Socialists have displayed their irresponsibility and inconsistency and are jeopardising a strategic project that creates jobs .
Such huge resources are being poured into this and it is not acceptable .
The European Commission published a new set of guidelines on breast cancer screening and diagnosis in April .
But this proposal is primarily about containment , not banning .
My understanding of the Executive of this and of many other Parliaments across the world is that the Administration is generally neutral .
Perhaps Parliament made somewhat of a mistake , here , in what it expected of the negotiations - we wanted to take care of too many matters at the same time .
It is high time that we radically re @-@ structured our entire energy system .
The European Council of March 2007 , a year ago , established precise and binding objectives , with an ambitious plan to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and increase the use of renewable energy in our energy consumption .
This was also discussed at the New York meeting .
The Statute for Members will be adopted before the end of the Luxembourg Presidency .
It is also important to remember that in December , when the multinational force was disbanded even before it arrived on the premise that all the refugees had returned to Rwanda and that there were therefore no more refugees in Zaire , few dared claim that about 400 , 000 people were missing from the roll call .
Spain has witnessed racist attacks against immigrants in Barcelona and Madrid .
( EL ) Mr President , Community legislation on organic products has been applied in the European Union for over 15 years with a fair degree of success , one might say , to judge from the results .
We are also considering ways of making trade in goods easier .
We are , at the same time , negotiating joint ventures allowing increased access for Europe &apos; s large @-@ scale fishing vessels in developing country waters at the expense of 190 million small @-@ scale fish workers in those countries world @-@ wide .
But since I want to contribute solutions and not just praise , I would like to point out that although this report &apos;s premises are clear and precise , its conclusions probably do not go far enough .
The Commission also calls on the Council to show flexibility , but above all to consider the revision of the 1999 comitology decision as a priority .
( DE ) Mr President , Mr Gloser , Commissioner , the Presidency @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council should , in my view , observe the following guidelines in its current negotiations with the United States on the transfer of airline passenger data .
( HU ) In recent days , perhaps partly on account of the crisis , popular opinion in the Member States that acceded in the last five years has responded with increasing sensitivity to any step that might call into question or discredit the equal status and identical standards of their membership within the Union .
In short , mobile satellite services ( MSS ) are set to be a success in the industrial sense and also as an enhancement of cultural diversity and pluralism in the media .
The small businesses in the European Member States have already put their houses in order and they are working with practical workable hygiene codes .
In Parliament &apos;s present position , I consider a secret ballot rather than a roll call to be , in both instances , a very important safeguard for Parliament .
But the opt @-@ out is a big issue for us .
I am in broad agreement with the rapporteur , in that we must be sure not to lapse into romanticism , because fishing has changed and that is what we should be addressing .
Admittedly the excesses committed in the name of autonomy until 1989 triggered a process of recentralization which highlighted certain equally deplorable excesses .
Whatever the final vote tomorrow , that is the message I would wish us to convey to both the Council and the Commission .
The ever shortening turnaround times are greatly to be welcomed ; here , the Ombudsman is an example of good administrative practice on a European scale .
The balance between the ECB and the national central banks under the regulation is particularly appropriate : while both the ECB and national central banks can initiate a sanctions procedure , decisions can only be handed down by the competent bodies of the ECB .
The user believes that a therapy helps .
- A6 @-@ 0292 / 2005 by Mr Romeva i Rueda , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , on the Council &apos;s Sixth Annual Report according to Operative Provision 8 of the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports ( 2005 / 2013 ( INI ) ) ,
Should we then allow ourselves to be engulfed in a genuine currency war , started this time by the United States ?
Commissioner , we must do everything in our power to prevent artificial barriers being put in Croatia &apos;s path - barriers of a kind with which other candidates for accession have not had to contend .
I could even say that we should look at the Irish vote from a constructive perspective : this vote is the proof of the fact that we have not always known to be open partners of the simple citizen , who is rather the subject of efficient political practices than the defender of ideas and visionary concepts .
I believe the use that Ireland has made of these funds can serve as a model for other regions and countries of the Union .
The shape of the present @-@ day European Union is substantially different from the one it had in 1957 .
Having a baby for Europe , as one of my colleagues said , is hardly realistic , and it is an area in which we politicians should not become involved .
My Group has asked for a split vote on the last paragraph of Annex VI of the proposal , which defines a list of processes where the use of CFC @-@ 11 may still be permitted as a processing agent .
Coming from Scotland , I am particularly glad to see a strong statement in favour of less favoured areas in paragraph 82 .
It is for that that I thank Mrs Roth .
I therefore urge the Member States and the Commission once again to recognise genital mutilation , or the threat thereof , as a gender @-@ specific reason for granting asylum .
A new round of broad @-@ based negotiations must enable progress to be made in the further liberation and regulation of world trade , which is vital for a variety of reasons .
The next item is the report ( A5 @-@ 0092 / 1999 ) by Mr Busk , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down certain control measures applicable in the area covered by the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the North @-@ East Atlantic Fisheries ( COM ( 1999 ) 345 - C5 @-@ 0201 / 1999 - 1999 / 0138 ( CNS ) ) .
However , if this is to continue , this approach must be rigorously upheld .
There is no longer any specific reference to the concept of pre @-@ emptive war ; only an allusion to it remains , in paragraph 92 .
The Council would do well to take this warning into account , as the Convention , which is going to discuss the future of the EU , is about to begin .
However , voluntary agreements are not enough .
It seems to me that to concentrate on airport noise and not deal on a local level with road traffic , in particular , is a rather absurd form of discrimination against airports .
We must work for a more sustainable industry in the future .
In such a climate , corruption , nepotism and irregularities can thrive .
We have also requested better cooperation from the Commission - and not only the Commission , but also the European Defence Agency .
Without active cooperation from SMEs the whole affair will be rather pointless , it seems to me .
Up to ECU 10 , 000 was to be credited back to the mandator under the Council &apos;s common position .
We should support and lend substance to a &quot; European tourism award &apos; which renders tribute to sustainable tourism , while encouraging the study of measures to promote intra @-@ Community tourism .
I would point out to our colleagues from Luxembourg that they must remember that frontier workers who become unemployed in their country have also contributed to its social security budget .
Several tens of thousands of people have been affected by the rivers bursting their banks and the huge volume of rainfall in Germany , Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , Romania , Bulgaria and Hungary .
Moreover , the European Union does not have to dictate the contents of milk products , as long as the phytosanitary standards are complied with .
Both we and the people of Mexico set great store by this agreement .
What is important is that he or she should not be a paper tiger , but have a clear and strong mandate .
But is such a distinction possible when seen from the Koran &apos;s holistic perspective , a perspective which states that the Islamic faith is inseparable from a religious way of life ? It is indeed a culture but it is also a body of political legislation , a family code and so on , and it is the duty of the faithful to live by these rules as soon as they have the means to do so .
Can you give Parliament evidence of it ?
Another new initiative that has been well received by the international community is the global energy efficiency and renewable energy fund .
It is difficult to take into account the various requirements and follow a policy which will favour the weakest parties and supply a high @-@ quality product at affordable prices .
If you read the executive summary in the recent study , which , if I am correct , comes to 51 pages , and save yourself reading the other couple of hundred pages , it does not come down heavily on one side or the other .
Many thanks .
Naturally , the Commission will continue to monitor very closely the macroeconomic and fiscal situation and the implementation of the measures in Greece .
First of all , we must make a genuine effort .
In future , any contract which is concluded outside a company &apos;s business premises will be subject to a whole raft of regulations and rights of withdrawal , even if the consumer , as Mr Obermayr has just mentioned , has asked an electrician , decorator , painter or carpenter and so on to come into his house .
However , if and when the Lisbon Treaty is adopted , Parliament will be centrally involved and thus there will be a bigger role for open , transparent debate on CAP @-@ related issues , leading to greater legitimacy amongst the farming community .
I think that we need to look for the causes of these accidents and deal with them .
In 1997 there were 17 million people unemployed in the European Union .
Moreover , the European Council will also be examining the Commission ’ s communication on the sustainable development strategy , but I shall come back to that later because this is an issue which forms an entirely separate item on the Council ’ s agenda .
( FI ) Mr President , first of all I want to say that Mrs Záborská &apos;s report adopts the right approach .
These are all things which , in our view , do not justify giving Turkey candidate status at this point in time .
Are we , in future , to have a state of affairs in which everyone will no longer be allowed , irrespective of where they live or of their social status , to share in Europe &apos;s economic successes and in its prosperity ?
This is something that far too many signatory states seem to be ignoring today .
We now have on the table of the Intergovernmental Conference a draft Constitutional Treaty which regulates the delegation to the Commission of the power to enact delegated regulations .
Thank you very much to all of you .
Sufficiently important , I think , to receive timely treatment .
The report proposes improvements for half a billion citizens when exercising their rights concerning withdrawal from a contract , delivery of goods , statutory guarantee , methods of calculating the withdrawal period , unfair contractual terms , contracts providing digital content and on @-@ line auctions .
How can this House claim to fill the so @-@ called democratic deficit when the rights of Members are curtailed by anti @-@ democratic forces ?
The European Parliament has clearly stated that it would like to see the Turkish occupying forces withdrawn from northern Cyprus .
The quote is as follows : &quot; From Friday morning to Monday evening I slept five hours , had two night duties in accident and emergency .
The debate is suspended until 9 p.m.
Twenty @-@ one territorial associations are active in Germany , and they are openly anti @-@ Polish and anti @-@ Czech .
The third question is that of funding .
This should go hand in hand with a selfless and more balanced selection of regional aid projects .
Let me first take this opportunity to thank both the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council and the President of the Commission for constantly bringing up and resolutely following up the question of employment policy , even though the Santer plan was not followed up to the same extent and came to nought in the Council .
If I want to prove to you that there is no light in this semicircle , I have to show you that we are sitting in the dark .
Mrs Bachelot @-@ Narquin , you mention a right to diversity , and I once again reply that we are already working on it .
After the vote on the amendments :
The United Kingdom consumes £ 1 billion out of £ 300 billion of public expenditure and to expect that budget to satisfy the demands of the Maastricht convergence criteria is a nonsense .
The Commission shares the rapporteur &apos;s main concern of organising more efficient working and cooperation conditions between the Commission and the Committee on Petitions .
I will perhaps make some of you laugh by referring , to this end , to the European social forum which has just taken place in the region of Paris .
I also think that the proposals of the Environment Committee are right , and I can support them , and I think that different politicians should be involved in the deliberations , which goes somewhat further than what the Commission is saying .
To produce fat reports which will be translated into 11 languages but which nobody will read .
So there is a whole series of policies here which have to interlink to deal with issues about social inclusion .
Madam President , I request that EUR 16.5 million be approved in commitment appropriations for this line in place of the amount proposed in the amendment by the Committee on Budgets .
to rescind the law , in force in one EU Member State , that introduces the notion of collective guilt ,
The Environment Agency &apos;s report says that the European Union is making progress in its campaign to reduce certain forms of environmental stress , but not in the sense of improving the general quality of the environment , and certainly not in the sense of ensuring a sustainable development .
Naturally , if the legal basis – which we shall be examining , as I said before – is such that we find ourselves partly within the first pillar , in such an eventuality the Council will have no problem in discussing the matter with Parliament , and I shall gladly come before the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs once again to discuss it in detail .
More than 8 000 people in Italy and more than 350 000 in Europe die each year because of pollution caused by burning oil by @-@ products .

We are all aware that the economy is flagging and that unemployment is on the rise .
It was replaced by educational credits , which were , however , tied to residence in Switzerland .
The number of amendments which has actually been accepted is very large and I imagine that we agree that we need to examine how these ideas can be incorporated into an amended proposal so that we retain the structure and balance in the text and the proposal has some chance of being approved by the Council , because I think that , for all of us , the best balance is between what we want and what is feasible .
We also believe that the Union should seek together with other donors to speed up the visible reconstruction of Bosnia .
in writing . - I voted against the application of an external dimension of social policy , promoting labour and social standards and European corporate social responsibility .
Secondly , we will enhance transparency in the use of EU funds .
( GA ) A preparatory meeting will be held in Washington next week and in Oslo closer to the time of the meeting .
Although we are now waiting with interest and hope to see what political changes the demonstrations in the Arab countries will lead to , we cannot for a moment close our eyes to outrages which contravene international human rights agreements , such as the death sentence for minors .
What matters in the final analysis is that domestic resources be used and small circuits promoted .
We received good news last week with the successful sale of Portuguese , Spanish and Italian bonds , and we saw reductions in the spreads for Belgium and other countries .
The options for accelerating by means of open innovation , and research and knowledge in intensive production go hand in hand .
I cannot go any further , because we do not have the legal tools .
Sanctions cannot work . Confrontation is not the solution either .
I want to emphasise that the two legal documents - the modernised Customs Code and the e @-@ Customs Decision - will make the functioning of the European Union &apos;s customs services better , faster and even cheaper .
To name just two examples : land values can vary from EUR 12 000 per hectare to EUR 15 000 per hectare .
The Members of the House have stressed that what happened was an exceptionally serious terrorist attack against the supreme institution of greater global democracy .
This is not viable and cannot be considered either legally or institutionally .
. Mr President , I will do my best .
The reason for this is that the varying opinions that have emerged on this issue have resulted from differences in outlook between the individual countries , rather than from party politics .
It can be applied through eco @-@ taxes , for example , or with other charges .
There is also much to be said for doing so without coming up with a specific rule on the subject .
The selection and administration of Fund projects , as regards structural aspects , are delegated to the Member States within the framework of cofinancing requests .
Several of you , including Mr Ludvigsson , Mrs Ford , Mr Cancian and Mrs Băsescu , just now , called for the tests to be - I shall repeat what I heard - rigorous , credible and transparent .
( EL ) Mr President , the strategy we are debating today is extremely ambitious and , as far as the basic direction is concerned , Mr Koumoutsakos , the rapporteur for our political group , has already covered everything I wanted to say .
Mr President , first of all I congratulate Mr Wieland on his first speech before the European Parliament , and I also congratulate Mr Manzella on his report . On behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs , I would stress that the main emphasis of the changed procedural rules must lie in the preparation for the first reading .
Debate is most definitely taking place in the United States , and Europe can influence this debate .
Mrs Wallström can scarcely sell that project to the electorate .
There are some positive features which many Members have commented upon , in particular the introduction of satellite surveillance , along with the flexibility allowing the industry to roll on quotas into the next year and take them off quotas for the following year .
Although voluntary modulation is less desirable than compulsory modulation on account of the possible distortion of competitive relations between European farmers , the Dutch Labour Party can go along with it nevertheless , because it represents a step in the right direction .
A chimera of an agreement will always be just that – this needs to be said loud and clear .
I should like to point out that if labelling is of such great importance to consumers it is because it is their guarantee that product traceability has been tightened up , that the operators in the industry and also the European and national public authorities have become more accountable , and that control systems have been improved .
It does , however , introduce a number of amendments to the Council &apos;s proposal for the sake of clarity and transparency .
Thank you , Mr Söderman .
But the reason why I wanted to be shadow rapporteur on this report , and to support Mr Belder , was that , for disabled people , access to work depends more and more on access to the web .
When the French and Dutch duly voted &apos; no &apos; , we were told that actually most countries want it to continue , so we should continue .
It also raises two questions , however , which we omit from the European debate at our peril . On the one hand , the Ombudsman &apos;s activities must entail a review of the institution &apos;s profile and accessibility throughout Europe .
This is an issue of extreme importance to Members of this Parliament and , if we are re @-@ elected , we will keep pushing it forward .
We have just experienced some unacceptable situations in Split in connection with the Gay Parade .
I agree with the European Parliament &apos;s call for the Commission to prepare a new Action Plan 2011 @-@ 2015 and allocate necessary funding .
Neither of the two proposed amendments falls , in my view , into these categories .
However , I consider that a return to nuclear energy as an antidote to the greenhouse effect is not the solution in the fight against climate change ; on the contrary , it is a dangerous choice .
It is unacceptable that only 37.5 % overall of the TACIS funds budgeted have been paid out , and disturbing that only 25.5 % of the funds for Nuclear Safety Programmes have been paid out as well .
At the outset , Paul @-@ Henri Spaak , the great European , President of the first European Parliamentary Assembly , uttered the universal and eternal words : &apos; Let us not forget anything , for that would be a profanation , but we have decided to embark upon a great adventure which , if it succeeds , will allow us to save what we have in common and what we hold most dear &apos; .
The minutes of the last sitting have been distributed .
However , you have put your finger on the problem , namely the need for more solidarity and more consistency among the various Member States .
Nevertheless , the resolution rightly points out that &apos; full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia &apos; , including delivering the last two fugitives to The Hague , &apos; is a fundamental condition for Serbia to progress on the path to EU membership &apos; .
With this proposal , Europe places itself in an untenable position .
I believe that the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is justified in this case .
By donating blood , citizens are making an act of solidarity .

I am thinking about the large networks and the framework programmes of research and development .
They need some European spirit of reconciliation over there .
( DE ) Mr President , free trade can be a good thing , where it does not simply stop at free trade .
Perhaps we should prioritise dialogue with the countries that expect a lot from us , that is to say the poor countries ; I think , for example , that the G 77 group is one group we must certainly prioritise .
They will , however , have to increase significantly in order to meet our future needs whether for gas or electricity .
? 5 @-@ 0145 / 2003 by Mrs Maes , Mr Rod , Mrs Lucas , Mr Lannoye , Mrs Schörling and Mrs Isler Béguin , on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group , on the human rights situation in Zimbabwe ;
The Summit will have to deliver a strong political message with regard to the crisis , recognizing that it has global implications , highlighting the contributions that European partners have made , confirming the commitment of ASEM partners to undertake the necessary reforms and underlining the need to resist protectionism and pursue further liberalization as the most effective antidote to any calls for protectionism in both Asia and Europe .
The largest collection of such material is housed at Sellafield nuclear plant in England just 280 kilometres from County Louth .
Consolidating all the legal bases for OLAF , as the Council envisages , would mean wasting a lot more time over an uncertain outcome .
Those unable to leave Eritrea are either subject to open @-@ ended conscription in the army , or have to scratch out a living on the fringes of an economy bankrupted by years of futile war with neighbouring Ethiopia , widespread corruption and mismanagement of the economy .
It recognises a number of rights of workers &apos; representatives and of workers themselves ; it lays down sanctions that the Member States have to introduce into their own legislation - when implementing and applying the directive - effective , proportionate and dissuasive sanctions .
Mr President , I cannot understand how you can pass over the rights of an Irish person , who has been in a British prison for 12 months with no charges preferred , and yet give a hearing to UK Members who are raising the matter of four Liverpool supporters in prison in Strasbourg .
It will not prevent global warming , at best it will only slow it down , and we must assume that emissions will be reduced at most by 5 % , though we know that a reduction of between 60 % and 80 % is required in the industrialized nations .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , rapporteur , good economic governance in Europe is necessary ; of course it is .
First , I would like to pay tribute to the positive achievements of the Council Presidency and , at the same time , I would like to stress the importance of support from the European Union and , equally , of candidates with high standards of integrity for the elections of the new President of the Council , to be held on 23 June 2008 .
My vote in favour of today &apos;s resolution confirms the favourable opinion I have already expressed at the meeting of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
Our hope is that this will help Iraq to address its own reform agenda and facilitate its reintegration in the international community after years of isolation .
We now want an agreement at first reading on the basis of this compromise .
Together we have provided relief and hope for those suffering humanitarian catastrophes in more places than I can mention , from the Western Balkans to the Congo , to our ongoing work in Haiti today .
The summit should also provide definitive clarity as to the conditions concerning bilateral trade from 1 January 2010 onwards under the new common external tariff system of the customs union .
However , I understand the remarks .
It seems that those who say that we need to make more cuts get the loudest applause .
During 1997 , the Ombudsman &apos;s office handled a total of 1 412 cases . Of these , 1 181 were new complaints received in 1997 .
It is therefore crucial for governments to make realistic offers which are as far as possible in line with available jobs , temporary or permanent , which can be filled by means of migratory flows , which ultimately have the effect of balancing the European Union &apos;s demographic deficit .
It is clear that the European Union has not shown any lack of will ; I believe that one of the Member States of Mercosur has shown clear and decisive support for the multilateral round , and the Chilean and Mexican experiences - Mr Varela Suanzes @-@ Carpegna reminded us of this - demonstrate clearly that it is possible to go much further than the expectations established by the multilateral round .
It is not with the intention of making the workings of either the UN body more democratic , or of creating a new , fairer world order , that the majority in the European Parliament is doing this .
Lastly , I would point out - without wishing to cause offence - that the United Kingdom is still a Member of Echelon and I believe continues to work together with the United States , in other words with the people masterminding all the anti @-@ terrorist activities , who are explicitly violating human rights - consider Guantanamo , the bombings and such like . How can we be sure that these so @-@ called allies of ours are not violating human rights through intercepting communications too ?
And that is what we are proposing .
The Commission has blocked the novel food regulation , which we in the European Parliament decided on in the spring of last year .
The Europol agreement has now officially entered into force .
For the second year running , producers are tearing their hair out because the Greek government has arbitrarily set production at 275 kilograms per decare , whereas output is much higher and no @-@ one knows what will become of it .
I believe that the benefit will lie in the development of this Information Society into a society that is equally focused on the human dimension .
Overall , the economic situation and outlook remain unusually uncertain .
Disarmament and the creation of a nuclear @-@ free zone should , in my opinion , be an important goal of the EU &apos;s Middle East policy , in order to guarantee peace and security in this region .
Documents received : see Minutes
That is not what we disagree on .
I believe that the single European market is the European Community &apos;s greatest achievement and we must therefore establish mechanisms to guarantee its proper functioning as some countries - not all - move to monetary union .
Then we would have a deletion , but it would continue as follows : &apos; calls in particular on the Russian authorities to adopt preventive protective measures as regards human rights defenders , such as starting an investigation as soon as threats faced by them are known by the prosecutor and the judicial system ; &apos; .
In many cases the reason for non @-@ progress is the profound divergence of opinion between the Member States . A good example is the actions on temporary protection and on burden sharing .
I understand their positions and I thank them very much for taking a full part in the negotiations and in the discussions even though , as they pointed out , they cannot support the outcome .
What clear legal basis is there inside this European Union ?
The Committee on Development supports the opinion of the European Court of Auditors that objective , useful and clear indicators must be determined , which would enable the assessment of aid results , and it is hoped that such indicators will be prepared and implemented in the period 2007 @-@ 2013 .
In recent months we have repeatedly seen voting time extending far into the lunch break .
That is why it is right , for example , as Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt said , to mobilise research funds quickly .
We are , unfortunately , as has been mentioned , seeing some very serious things going on : abuse , money laundering , corruption , exploitation of underage players ; things which are serious crimes against which we really must take the action which we have been planning for so long .
Poland and Ukraine are linked by centuries of history as neighbours .
As a result , some members of the group , notably the French members , noting that previous commitments that were made at the time of the BSE motion of censure , and also following the decisions of the Committee of Inquiry into Fraud in Community transit , were not entirely fulfilled , have decided to vote for the motion of censure ...
Finally , the Committee on Legal Affairs decided to choose a different point in time , namely the moment when the banks participating in the payment system are informed of the opening of proceedings .
Thus provision is made for reducing the debt only in the case of countries which have followed neo @-@ liberal principles .
EU policy at this time should be directed entirely at the Belarusian people .
This means that I would warmly recommend Amendment No 2 , while I consider Amendment No 9 by the Liberal Group to be redundant .
And therefore , I believe this proposal will find support and I congratulate the rapporteur .
We were not always regarded by the government of Israel as the third party in such matters .
There is no development .
She has also pointed out the useful work done by a large majority of Members of this Parliament during the debate and the vote on the Draft Services Directive .
We should also particularly like to thank Estonia for having ratified the constitution a few days ago .
The Commission should speed up the provision of informal legal assessments to the centres on request .
Yes , that is correct , Mrs Staes .
So it was when Russia had Stalin , and so it was when Germany had Hitler .
This should be based on clear criteria with open application procedures and impartial adjudicators .
It was partly thanks to this that my objective as rapporteur , namely retaining municipal transport companies and freedom of choice , could be achieved .
Those who do not support this create the possibility of very vulnerable women and girls once again ending up in little backrooms with knitting needles in the foreseeable future .
Presentation of the programme of the Spanish Presidency ( continuation of debate )
The second thing I want to say is that the additional proposals brought in by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety may well keep big businesses happy , but they will have no such effect on small ones .
Finally , let us not forget the potential of global communications and especially the internet to promote human rights .
This is what has made Europe strong .
The Intercultural Dialogue will be a key feature of our work during the coming year and will remain so .
In this field , our Parliament has a legitimate role to play .
We have made amendments to six items as a matter of priority .
We have the blueprints and I urge all of those with the political will to take action , to deliver for the children of Africa .
In the financial statement for that proposal , the Commission anticipated expenditure of ECU 15 million for 1999 .
In my opinion , it is in diversity and technological innovation that we must find the response to the current energy challenges and issues associated with them .
It was polite of Mrs McAvan to try and persuade us that these things are not going on but , as a doctor , I know what is going on and it needs to be banned because this is also in keeping with the views of the European Parliament .
Let us take the example of the Marrakech Agreements on agriculture .
There are lots of pesticides , but no proper analysis is available .
in writing . I voted in favour of this report on the establishment of a European Institute for Gender Equality .
We have more than forty budget lines where the Council has either cut back totally or nearly totally on the grounds of the legal base .
No one may be compelled to use the euro , nor may anyone be prevented from using it ; the European institutions are called upon to prove by their involvement in the euro changeover that the euro age has indeed dawned , but that fact must not turn out to be the Achilles &apos; heel of the changeover process .
I was in Namibia for the independence elections .
In view of the scale of the possible consequences , the European Union Agriculture and Fisheries Council discussed the issue of high prices at its meeting in April .
I voted in favour of the Rübig report on roaming on public mobile networks in the Community .

In other words this approach , which is closer to the citizen , is quite different from what used to be done in the past .
The euro is based on powerful , organised and controlled economies .
We might add that it contributed to the sleight of hand that produced a truly miracle cure for certain Member States of the monetary union .
This whole area of oceans is extremely complex , but our life , the way we live , also influences the ecosystems there .
Although I am in favour of cooperation that is more intergovernmental in nature , I realise that there are cases in which we need our laws to be as uniform as possible in the Union .
That is why we need a sensible drinking policy ; that is why we urge the Commissioner to stick to that sensible message that he began with and why we would suggest that he does not go down the road of trying to harmonise criminal law , not least because you cannot harmonise the enforcement of criminal law , and we know that in drink @-@ driving that is a major problem between Member States .
His contribution to this achievement undoubtedly made Bronisław Geremek - who also served as a member of the Sejm , the lower house of the Polish Parliament , for many years and was his country &apos;s Foreign Minister from 1997 to 2000 - one of the founding fathers and chief architects of the new Poland .
Allow me to close by saying that it is developments in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia which concern us most at present .
I shall try to make good use of the time .
The Hungarian Government said at the beginning that , if the Commission identified any kind of incompatibility , it would amend the law , and it has done so .
We simply ask that co @-@ decision be applied here , which the Council is repeatedly denying us .
Mr President , I shall concentrate on the amendment put down by the Socialist Group to the effect that there should be no ceiling on VAT rates .
We need a multifaceted strategy to ensure that these people are guaranteed equal opportunities in full respect for the European citizens &apos; Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Cows are becoming a rare commodity in northern Kenya because of climate change .
We have in particular agreed to hold local dialogues with five Latin American countries - Brazil , Colombia , Argentina , Chile and Mexico - and will continue to establish dialogues with the remaining central Asian countries .
This is just a follow @-@ up to your response to this very complicated matter , which I much appreciate .
We can see this from the reports issued by the French Parliament , for example , describing how the French Parliament was involved , or rather was actually not involved , in France &apos;s intervention in Rwanda .
Ladies and gentlemen , this is a bonus that we should not carelessly fritter away .
Now they are suddenly supposed to be funded by the Community budget , which is utterly extraordinary .
. Mr President , this report states that the EU @-@ US agreement in this sphere is going to become ‘ the standard , both for European legislation and globally ’ .
Thirdly , we must preserve the possibility of financing projects from the private cofinancing of European Union funds , without involving national public funding .
However , as far as can be foreseen , it would seem that you are once again working at the wrong level with the wrong resources and within the wrong framework because you are trying to deal with the issue outside of the Treaties .
Consultation with representatives from the fisheries and processing sectors is similarly crucial , because this will rectify any shortcomings in the provisions relating to the conservation of stocks .
The debates and questions have focused on minor issues and on the progress we need to make on these issues in the future .
It is essential that the specific characteristics of these regions be taken into account , much more and much better than they are now , by the politicians in Brussels , especially :
But I am against Amendments Nos 19 and 22 which do not help very much in this situation .
Otherwise there will still be pressure to supply food even more cheaply than the Americans and other competitors outside the EU by further intensification , further exploitation of the soil and export subsidies .
We are also concerned that the proposals as they stand will not necessarily result in any major real environmental benefits : production methods for most biofuels use substantial amounts of energy and create high carbon dioxide emissions .
Of course , any change must be agreed unanimously , but it is essential that this Commission and this Parliament have the opportunity to launch a genuine debate , without taboos , about the future of the European Union ’ s spending and resources .
It is also important for us to try to look around and see what the situation will be in the event of greater mobility for the countries that have not applied any transitional rules because mobility is not particularly extensive .
The whole point of the MAGP is to reduce fishing effort and bring it into better balance with the existing fish stocks .
Clearly , if you remove mortgage credits from this directive and move them to another directive you will be opening up the field to the banks , which will take advantage of mortgage credits to attack other consumer credit markets .

Firstly , it will ensure that all institutions that sustain or link the 27 Member States operate more successfully .
The European Union has been very constructive in the support it has provided in recent years .
As chairman of this House ’ s delegation for relations with Russia , I should like to make one last observation .
In the strict sense of the term , this is a vital question .
Eighty per cent of the population live in towns or cities .
Often , passengers were not provided with adequate information either by telephone or via the Internet .
Now , sobriety has returned , and a broad civic debate has been promised on Europe &apos; s goals , future and responsibilities . That is the way it should be .
The EQF , by acting as a translation tool for national authorities , will undoubtedly help our constituents to overcome this senseless discrimination .
A number of Members raised the budget issue .
It is perhaps true to say that we have not invested enough in the agricultural sector in recent years .
No more Eurospeak .
Finally , our amendment asking for the phasing @-@ out of mega @-@ energy projects that heavily damage the environment was rejected , too .
For example , at Question Time in December last year , I promised to consider how export refunds for live cattle might be linked to compliance with the transport directive , even where animals were being transported beyond the borders of the European Union .
In this field , too , we have made some progress in the past - albeit with difficulty .
At the same time , within this policy , the role of the most vulnerable groups - women and children - must certainly be analysed extremely carefully .
It is essential that the global commitment to addressing the specific needs of the LDCs , as regards the sustainability of development in all of its economic , social and environmental aspects , and to supporting them in their efforts to eradicate poverty , be reaffirmed during this conference .
Access to water , the quality of which is constantly deteriorating , has become a concern for all of us .
Here , there is already a European authority for employment policy , an authority that needs no further debate and one that undoubtedly meets with the highest level of public acceptance .
President Prodi , we are impressed by what you have said .
What concrete measures will the Commission propose in its forthcoming report on implementation of the EU EDC strategy ?
Madam President , there is every reason to congratulate the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the European Council on the very well organised Tampere Summit , which proved even more fruitful than anticipated .
To conclude , the Committee on Culture believes - you can shake your head , Mr Bangemann , but this is what our committee believes - that the priority for the European Union should be to address the technology gap between itself and the USA , and to put in place not an umpteenth policy of protectionism , as some Member States are tempted to do , but a coordinated and dynamic European multimedia policy by stimulating a market centred on European products and services , facilitating their spread throughout the territory of the Union , in association with the most innovative small businesses - in short , by using European skills in this area to maximum advantage .
It is clear that delayed consumer spending is affecting European high @-@ end products , including those from my country , Italy , in a sector that has seen , as the Chairman of the Committee on International Trade pointed out , the loss of 350 000 jobs and 5 % of businesses .
Fire prevention is instead a part of the EU regulation on rural development and should remain so in the future .
I therefore voted for this report because we are talking about protecting childhood , the right of thousands of children to go to school or to be given the best possible conditions in which to learn .
I am therefore in favour of specific actions at both EU and national level aimed at targeting support to services encouraging the integration into society , education , vocational training and the labour market of people with disabilities .
Mr Hendrick &apos;s report discusses the key to solving Europe &apos;s employment problem .
Mr Liikanen , hearty thanks to you , also representing your colleagues .

We have a saying in Glasgow : if you live in a glasshouse you do not have sex with your gardener !
The Commission needs reform and Union needs a strong , independent , politically reformed Commission .
I can say that the EU @-@ Africa summit established a framework for all the talks on migration management which have been conducted at several conferences between Africa and the European Union .
This bridging project could be carried out differently - not via the Gulf of Maliakos . It is curious to note that , while the Ministry for the Environment places this region within Natura 2000 , with the onset of the work it will destroy this region by carrying out a bridging operation which will totally transform this deep gulf into one which is incapable of supporting any form of marine life whatsoever .
One , the Treaty : if you have got a lot of Member States to ratify without problems , you have done a great job ; two , the energy package : if you have got some of that done , you have done a great job ; and three , if you have succeeded with Kosovo , you have done it .
A recent report from the Coalition for a Different Europe estimates that at least 700 peaceful demonstrators were arrested during the Amsterdam Summit in June .
The Court has yet to rule on the matter , so as long as there are differing views I shall apply the selfsame rule that Mr Striby quoted : &apos; The President shall decide whether amendments are admissible . &apos; That is the wording of Rule 125 ( 3 ) , and I have communicated that decision to you .
The Europe of today is no longer the airy kite capable of playing the winds of history that it was at the time of the Treaty of Rome .
We also note that it cannot be funded without a revision of the Financial Perspective or a reduction of other appropriations under heading 3 .
To my mind , what is important is that the market is provided with a sufficient degree of clear information that is useful .
Where the European Union can intervene , as it is already doing in MEDIA Plus , it should be able to continue doing so with a greater volume of financial resources .
Mr President , it gives me great pleasure to be able to present a fisheries agreement that is imbued with a new spirit , in that it takes account of the interests not only of the European Union but also of the indigenous Senegalese fishermen and of fish stocks .
Secondly , I believe that what we are seeing today in Egypt and Tunisia is a democratic tsunami .
In the regulation itself , NGOs have been given a special role : that of requesting an internal review with regard to decisions by the institutions .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great honour for me to speak for the first time in this House on behalf of the millions of Europeans who want a different Europe .
( BG ) Mr President , Mr Šefčovič , ladies and gentlemen , discussing the work programme of the European Commission is not merely a formality .
I think this is a very important message for the future : Let us work together , be open @-@ minded and promote creativity .
The discussions about the draft conclusions will be held in the next few weeks .
It now remains to give practical expression to that ambition .
This is a subject which has , up till now , been given scanty attention , but now Mr Wolf has produced a very interesting report on the subject .
It is out of the question to apply stricter labelling rules for soya and maize than we do for a novel food which is going direct to the end consumer , and that is why we are going to have to reconsider this matter .
Why is it so important for Europe to deal with this problem ?
I agree with the Commission that supply and demand imbalances in the wine sector , and increasing challenges on European and international wine markets point to the need for reform in this sector as well .
The victims of the Erika disaster want their ordeal to serve to prevent the recurrence of this sort of disaster in future .
This is the only solution .
A report or document is not enough . It does not take ministers to produce reports and documents summarising positions .
That event was the agreement of Hamas and Fatah over the so @-@ called prisoners ’ document .
I voted against the resolution on the European textile market .
I would point out , as several honourable Members have said , that the employment strategy needs to be discriminating , its scope needs to be clear and it should not be incorporated into the economic guidelines .
These are completely opposed to nationalism and chauvinism , which are characterised by hatred of other people .
Mr Barroso , we wish you broad support for your new Commission and every success in your difficult job .
I have been a fervent advocate of this for years and happily moves are now afoot in the Netherlands to set up something of that kind .
Although there were no spectacular successes , more was achieved than hitherto .
It is just as important for these rights to become known and for them to have sufficient content and not least their practical implementation is of fundamental importance .
In this way Brussels is becoming increasingly remote from those it claims to represent , and that is bad for democracy .
However , at the end of the day we want to take action , we want to help our citizens and we want to move forward , and therefore we have to make do with what we have and make the best possible use of our limited funds and resources .
The debate is closed .
The Commission works as a college .
The Commission will indeed ensure that the outcome of the workshops which were organised in 2007 will be taken into account in the CFR .
The problems in the border area cannot be insoluble .
A similar argument was used in defence of his ruling by Wee Ka Siong , Deputy Education Minister , when he justified the corporal punishment of children in schools , adding that the punishment could be carried out only by directors of schools or assigned persons , that parents would be informed about a punishment , and that a witness would be present when the punishment was carried out .
Israelis and Palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the Sharm el @-@ Sheikh Memorandum .
During my many years of working as a judge , I have always seen to order in the court .
For its part , the Union insists on the need to create the best possible conditions for foreign investment .
Electronic communications ( processing of personal data and protection of privacy )
I should have liked to see clearer statements regarding democracy und human rights in Turkey .
This is a danger we will not countenance .
The external evaluation of the first three years , commissioned by the European Commission , shows that the Foundation concentrated too much on managing programmes and too little on policy advice .
The Council has always made it absolutely clear that progress on each of those tracks is interlinked , that we cannot make progress in one area without being able to demonstrate that we are making progress in others .
For that to exist there has to be a nation .
As the country prospers internationally , the gap between the rich and the poor within its borders is widening and I therefore support this report ’ s emphasis on tackling trade and development issues together .
While the police remain free to torture prisoners and human rights continue to be violated , there is no way , as far as I am concerned , that the negotiations can begin .
This communication reviewed Recommendation 2001 / 331 / EC of the European Commission , providing minimum criteria for environmental inspections .
I am certainly not making the points that follow out of a desire to criticise , therefore , but , if anything , in order to share our hopes , although I fear that they may be quite insubstantial in areas such as small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , with regard to which a number of different points have been made .
Certain quarters are guilty of whipping up public sentiment against any possible approach to tackle terrorism and that is no way for us to serve the citizens of Europe .
The report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and security goes further , with a common arms policy and the revision of the treaty article on the essential security interests of each Member State .
Development of the Community &apos;s railways ( vote )
Naturally , we hope that , parallel to this - and perhaps even as a result of it - political development in Turkey towards democracy and respect for human rights , in particular respect for its own Kurdish population , will also be strengthened , and the death penalty abolished .
I think it is very sad if the Commission does not accept - even at this early stage - amendments regarding the reporting requirement where essentially , for once , I agree with her advisor , in other words that Parliament should reinforce reporting .
First the debate after the matters of urgency was abolished , and then the vote after the matters of urgency as well . I see this as a systematic dislocation of the rhythm of the sessions and I ask that it be changed , or that it be clarified for the remainder of the year whether we now want to hold such a session after every summit , as then the remaining mini @-@ plenaries in Brussels could be done away with and everything sorted out by being deferred to the week after the summit in question .
Madam President , these reports seek to improve regulation of the market in products , especially by tightening up recognition of the CE label and banning misuse of the label .
– Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioner , I think it is very important that we are holding this debate today in the European Parliament .
The Member States and the European Commission must agree on more effective measures to guarantee the rights of the most vulnerable groups of society to a proper education with vocational training and university studies , which would allow them to integrate better into the active labour market and halt the risk of poverty .
( RO ) We asked for the debate on the situation of the journalist arrested illegally in Transnistria on worrying charges to be replaced by the debate on Thailand at a time when the situation in Thailand has worsened dramatically during recent days .
Let me illustrate this with point 10 of my report on the subject of tobacco .
For me , as a doctor , there is only the patient .
This report is beyond improvement and I warn the House not to continue making a fool of itself with such absurd reports , because the issue of anti @-@ racism is too important to be used as the basis for some sort of ideological show battle .
We also have to ensure that both the Ottawa Convention against Land Mines and the Charter for an International Criminal Court are ratified .
Madam President , I would be very obliged if you would read the name of the card I was accused of voting for twice and have the services check if votes were cast on that card .
And that is serious , as the Commissioner knows .
Without going into detail on the proposal , I can confirm that our action plan will be based on activities that we have been driving for some time , and will integrate them into a coherent context , seeking to present that political vision that is still lacking in European action on urban mobility .
So far , the results have been meagre .
That is why Innovation Union is one of the flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy .
You seem to be happy with taking very small steps , but what we need is a giant leap forward .
Thank you , Commissioner Nielson .
Assessing a country &apos;s readiness for candidate status is one of the most important institutional duties that the Commission undertakes .
We are now seeing the second and third generation of equipment for digital television .
We have no use for a directive on driving times and rest periods if we do not wish to have any means whereby these may be checked up on .
The debate which we held recently on the bodies for collective investment in transferable securities and the reactions to the report on pension funds , which we will hear shortly , demonstrate the complexity and importance of these issues .
Certainly the current rules benefit car manufacturers and dealers and disadvantage consumers .
As usual , you were not listening and , as usual , we were right .
The debate is closed .
The EU must be a Europe of freedom , in which people and businesses compete for the favour of consumers and not for that of the protectionists .
But our Parliament has tied this aid to certain conditions and now we have to ensure that these conditions are met .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( FI ) Mr President , a new atmosphere of cooperation has emerged between the European Union and Russia in recent months : the Spirit of Lahti , as it was called after the informal summit in the autumn .
Thirdly , there will need to be an assessment of the energy balance @-@ sheet .
This round of enlargement will increase the population by 28 % whilst GDP will increase by only 6 % .
She highlights the fact that the Member States can use these as a matter of principle , in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity .
Mr President , I will be extremely brief because I am conscious of the fact that unavoidably my first contribution was long .
Mr Schlyter &apos;s report recognises the complexity of dealing with the problem of discarding fish and I really welcome his inclusive approach .
In addition to the need to have sufficient staff in the Commission &apos; s directorates @-@ general to cope with the change , coordination is also a key area if we are to send a clear message to the public through a wide @-@ ranging communications strategy with adequate financial resources and an appropriate time frame . We are therefore proposing that the campaign should be extended to 2002 .
That is correct .
Fourthly , we consider that the new treaty unfortunately does not contain adequate means and recommendations for facing many of the enormous challenges of the twenty first century , a large number of which are mirrored in the developmental policy .
I would like to start by making a series of observations .
That is why we have tabled a set of draft amendments that we consider essential for a thorough overhaul of the current common agricultural policy .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , if there is one thing that worries me about the situation in Europe - and we have had a few examples this morning - it is a type of politics that all too often appears to be self @-@ referential .
Socrates helps , it airs political questions and brings them to the public &apos;s attention , but does not absolve the Member States of responsibility .
Firstly , we have to push manufacturers to take a greater interest in their supply chain and , if necessary , apply penalties to those who do not take that interest .
The EGF is aimed at helping workers who are victims of company relocations , and it is fundamental in facilitating their access to new employment .
In 2007 , in the euro zone , trade recorded a surplus of 28.3 billion euros , as compared to a deficit of 9.3 billion euros in 2006 .
Mr President , Mrs Kjer Hansen has said that we have been holding the same type of debate for some time now which is becoming quite depressing .
It is easy to see why the Council has kept these negotiations secret for more than a year , for , if they lead to an agreement , very important parts of the legal certainty by which most of our legal systems are characterised would be successfully abolished at the stroke of a pen .
Side by side , we walk into the future together ; this is a great day for us all !
The Commission delegations will be reinforced so that they can better monitor the implementation of Phare .
As you are well aware , Russia has issued an official proposal for breaches of the rights of the Slovene minority in Austria to be placed on the agenda of the EU – Russia Summit .
I understand that this was probably your opinion , Commissioner Verheugen , and I think I can guarantee you the support of a large majority of my colleagues in this area .
The EU , in its continuous efforts to extend its own reach , is often complicit in this .
And yet here we are imposing another burden through this directive on local and regional authorities .
With millions of animals being slaughtered and farms being crippled or wiped out , this is hardly the time for party political argument .
The people must again draw their own conclusions .
In September this year , Mr Barroso assured us of the intensive work being carried out by the Commission in this area .
I think this would be unfortunate .
( The sitting was suspended at 12.30 p.m. and resumed at 3.05 p.m. )
Abolishing controls on the internal borders depends on adequate compensatory measures in terms of strengthening controls on the external borders and cooperation between the police , customs and courts .
The report lists a host of different measures at EU level , all with attendant costs requiring significant increases in the budget .
In addition , we wish persons arrested and charged with piracy to be judged in the countries of the area , as provided for in the March 2008 treaty with Kenya and the Seychelles .
The euro is certainly an important step - and I agree with the line taken by President Prodi - but it is not enough .
If you throw out the Commission proposal lock , stock and barrel – that is to say , not just the part that deals with competition , but also the part covering transparency – then there will be no European regulation , and , in its absence , nobody will have the certainty needed to plan ahead or any certainty as to what the law is .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , please permit me to start my statement with an expression of thanks to the staff of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy and also to the staff of the groups , who , over the past years - just as much as the rapporteurs on the individual countries - have taken such trouble in dealing with this issue in depth , so that we have always been enabled , by broad majorities , to do justice to our task .
The Commission hopes that the bold step taken by the European institutions to mobilise the one billion euros which will complement other financial instruments which have been earmarked to respond to the food crisis - of both a short- and medium- to long @-@ term nature - is followed up by other donors .
Then there are the losers : the Netherlands and your country , Germany . And as a Frenchman , I understand exactly how you feel , because we have been losing up to EUR 4 billion a year , the equivalent of investing in a high @-@ speed train link , like the Paris @-@ Bordeaux train , in a single year .
Confidence is built not by analysis on its own , but only by action .
One of the causes of the accidents that occurred after the Tricolor sank was a breakdown in communication between an English @-@ speaking captain and the French pilot services .
I would point out here that the Commission , in its communication of 24 March 1996 on structural measures and employment , indicated that it planned to target structural measures more towards the creating of jobs by aligning a few points of the existing planning with the requirements of the legislation in such a way as to place greater emphasis on jobs .
I would like to ask the President of the European Central Bank the following questions .
It can be said , therefore , that it is an ongoing , intensive process in which we do not have all the answers yet .
Regarding procedural law , however , I have already had occasion to say that the Commission intends to present a communication on this subject , which has become all the more necessary in the light of the most interesting political debate on the European arrest warrant .
That cannot be allowed to continue , but neither can the historic reasons for causing it to happen .
Indeed , without prejudice to constant concern with human rights violations , Parliament ’ s main obligation is to assess the usefulness of our endeavours in combating these violations .
Thirdly , uncertainty over approval and the functioning and effective application of the stability plan .
Ljubljana looks set to achieve the four Maastricht criteria on target , reducing inflation , and that is a considerable achievement .
Mr President , I should first of all like to thank the two rapporteurs , Mr Gil @-@ Robles and Mr Tsatsos , for their excellent analysis and their report on the Convention &apos;s activities .
Over the years , the EU has established fisheries partnership agreements with a number of countries and , in exchange , has made a certain financial contribution intended essentially to support national fisheries policies , particularly to protect stocks .
In respect of the financial crisis I believe this Parliament can rightly claim to have been at the front of the game .
Europe is very distant from its citizens , anti @-@ Europeanism has grown and will continue to grow because people have the feeling they are no more than chess pieces on the European board in a game which industry and the economy are winning .
( DE ) Mr President , a fellow Member on the left of the House has just used the tragic issue of the death penalty in Iran and the dreadful crimes being committed there as a pretext to launch an assault on religion per se .
Calls also for an agenda to eradicate the pay gap that exists between women and men.&apos;
I think that in accordance with proposals by a number of organizations , the electoral process should be repeated in areas where serious infringements of electoral law were reported .
At a time when electors want decisions to be taken as close to them as possible , how can we call for a list which will lead to an abstention rate close to 99 % if it is implemented ?
This would mean that we could make far @-@ reaching tax reforms which would contribute to a more favourable environment for our economy , for business initiative , to freeing up resources and promoting them by fiscal means in an area which is one of our priority commitments : to be up @-@ to @-@ date and competitive at the most advanced levels of the information society and in the application of new technologies .
However , it should not only be the job of the Commissioner for the Environment to create awareness of this .
Secondly , in the case of Bulgaria and Romania , the funds are connected to agreements with the International Monetary Fund which have this same objective .
I would also ask you to vote against Amendments 46 and 47 , since it would appear that these rules are already included in the text , and so they will merely pad out the regulation unnecessarily .
And so I ask Commissioner Piebalgs to have the European Commission enter into negotiations with the Cuban Government to allow the International Red Cross to visit Cuban political prisoners .
Could I just make one final point ?
I certainly do not intend to oppose these proposals , but I would nevertheless like to emphasize that we in this Parliament fail to understand just what an enormous influence we can have , and what we can achieve in this area .
I am delighted that this subject is now being discussed in a proper manner .
We must ensure that every judicial decision prioritises the interests of the child .
I am therefore at a loss to understand how anyone - especially the open source community - can be opposed to any form of directive in this area , as this would simply allow the current practice , which this community views very critically , to continue .
Forward @-@ looking targets have been formulated for the entire Community .
I cannot exclude the possibility that the Commission may take measures if it notices obstacles preventing this , in order to take account of the worries of consumers .
This is certainly something that we in Europe can understand very well .
I am talking about those which , despite being intended for people with disabilities , have the main objective of alleviating the dependency of these people , improving their state of health and living conditions with regard to people requiring special care .
The willingness of the rapporteur to do this was another factor that encouraged me to vote for the report .
For these people to be treated fairly , they should be given rights and duties that are , as far as is reasonable , equivalent to those of the citizens of EU countries .
It would be an exercise well worth doing .
However , I do object greatly to paragraph 80 in which it is regretted that development cooperation has not been further &quot; communitarized &apos; .
When we analyse the way funds are administered , we cannot but note with a critical eye the re @-@ emergence of old familiar problems .
In particular , the principles of democracy and basic human rights are , with Islam , the founding tenets of the new Iraq .
One such amendment emphasises the particular importance the Chinese authorities attach to Portuguese language speaking and the enormous recognition given by the European Parliament to Portuguese which is , in terms of the number of speakers , Europe &apos;s third most important world language .
Our aim is to discuss everything jointly in the codecision procedure with a clear focus and therefore I ask you for your support .
Soil really does not have any cross @-@ border implications and should therefore remain a competence of the Member States .
We need to support the improvement of the safety norms in Central and Eastern European countries , since it is on account of their low level that nuclear power plants need to be shut down .
Will the Commission convict the people who use the tools of the state for party political and even personal interests ?
And then , as the President @-@ in @-@ Office said this morning , the institutional balances are out of kilter and need to be redefined .
In common with the rapporteur , Mrs Bourzai , whom I should like to congratulate on the excellent work she has produced and on the dialogue she initiated , I believe that the Commission &apos;s proposal is a good one and that this subject has been calling out for a solution for a long time .
( FR ) Madam President , as already stated , the European Union has been negotiating the conclusion of a free trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council for nearly 20 years .
When will those responsible at last understand that sparing resources is not something we do for fun ; nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group , rather it is a joint European challenge .
However , in 2007 , roughly 2 600 people were victims of rail accidents , while last year , more rail accidents occurred involving passenger and freight trains .
Just let us imagine that Russian were to become an EU official language .
The report by our colleague Mr Campos responds to two of our Parliament &apos;s requirements , which is why I will support the author &apos;s opinion .
It is very clear , Mr McMahon .
We cannot therefore accept the objectives contained in this directive .
So in formal terms , there is no reason for Parliament to revise its position of two months ago .
All these things seem to have come into some murky area somewhere because one or two of the resolutions we have passed recently have failed to be specific on the requests we are putting to the Commission .
If I may be permitted to summarise , I would like to say that we are on the right track , but it would in particular be to the Commission &apos;s credit if we could convert our good intentions into roadmaps in order to create concrete handholds that enable us to evaluate where we stand and evaluate our progress together every year and in order to prevent the Member States from hiding behind fine words .
Commissioner , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , let me give you an example of this : if there were a change to the weighting of votes within the Council , which would mean that the countries with a higher population as well as the larger countries would in fact have more power , and if the extension of qualified majority voting , extended to the codecision procedure , meant that this tendency in the European Parliament also became more marked , my question is : what role will the European Union &apos; s small or weak countries have in Europe ?
It is very much in the interests of better decision @-@ making within the Union to have an effective Council which is transparent and exercises all the duties conferred upon it by the Treaty .
The reality is also the existence of autonomous machinery for regionalized spaces for free movement of persons like that of the Nordic Passport Union .
In conclusion I would like to quote Mr von Wogau &apos;s words from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy to the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs .
This means that Parliament might perhaps be able to play a steering role and that is why , colleagues , it is of crucial importance that we set the budget tomorrow with a large majority .
Also a recommendation that taxpayers should compensate Equitable Life policy holders but not National Provident Institution policy holders or failed institutional pension scheme members whose case is no less convincing .
So there are two blocks .
This is required of us by Article 129 of the Treaty .
Our goal must be healthy , prosperous , secure societies , where everyone feels they can play their part .
Obviously any such action will be a matter for discussion and agreement in the Council but I assure the Member we will keep the situation under close review .
It is a solemn statement that we are going to take the economic aspects of our monetary union further .
In other words , finance policy , labour market policy , structural policy - all economic areas , everything that has any significance to the economy - is to be unified .
We must clarify that , if entrepreneurship does not develop at a fast rate in the EU , we shall have to definitively forget the Lisbon objectives as of now .
Words such as ‘ infringement proceedings ’ , ‘ Stability and Growth Pact ’ , ‘ Lisbon ’ and ‘ Barcelona ’ spring to mind .
We must continue to view our coasts and seas as an opportunity .
These countries have made strenuous efforts to comply with the EU ’ s demands , with particular regard to institutional and economic issues .
How can the European Parliament justify the proposed increase ?
Mr President , what would happen if a small Danish limited company with 100 employees were to draw up annual accounts about which a chartered accountant made a declaration emphasising that most of the reservations were due to the fact that they recurred from year to year ; and if it were confirmed that the weaknesses were to a large extent due to the failure of the company &apos;s accounting system to provide adequate assurance that its balance sheet was complete and included all the elements of the company &apos;s activities ; and if , in addition , the declaration stated that there were problems with the monitoring and security systems , and that the data in the system were not complete ; and it continued by saying that it was a matter of concern that the company did not give a high enough priority to remedying these defects , and that it had not given sufficient consideration to the area or allocated enough resources to finding a solution to the problems within a reasonable time frame ? What would happen if it was ultimately concluded that no declaration could be made as to whether the construction work , purchases or services forming the basis of the payments to the local recipients , actually took place ?
We , the European parliamentarians , should lead the battle for the principles which brought us into this House : peace , democracy , tolerance , justice and solidarity .
The budget increase makes LIFE + a substantial independent instrument in European Union environmental policy .
In my own country , Sweden , one of our biggest export industries is affected , namely the music and sound recording industry .
I myself have seen places in the heart of Berlin where people drowned in canals because nobody on the wall could help them , or was allowed to .
It also shows , however , that in future a solution to every crisis can be found by means of international cooperation .
Despite all our negative experiences and our reservations concerning the government of Mr Lukashenko , the EU has stretched out its hand to Belarus over recent months .
Shipbreaking on South Asian coasts is often carried out under appalling conditions : there is no protection against pollution whatsoever and workers &apos; lives are at risk .
At the present time , increasing the use of renewable energy sources is mainly the responsibility of the Member States .
It is no longer comprehensible to or tolerable for our own citizens , of whom we are currently asking sacrifices and new taxes to meet the Maastricht criteria , that Europe should not develop the minimum of cohesion needed to send a humanitarian force to a European country in a process of disintegration within a realistic time scale .
It is our duty to support the leaders of the Iranian opposition so that they avoid a similar fate .
We therefore think it important to strike a balance between these two elements , namely technology and the content and characteristics of the product .
Mr President , I am very pleased that we have this balanced compromise and I am glad that we have rejected the idea of a ban only on products designed to go in children &apos;s mouths .
I am not disputing the fact that in the future the Community will have to lead the negotiations in certain areas , that is right and proper , not least because of the equivalence that needs to be established .
As I have indicated , this lies within the power and responsibility of the ASEAN countries .
With regret , therefore , I found myself unable to support this report , though I share the concern for children &apos;s welfare that its supporters expressed .
This is indeed a telling indictment of the regime in Burma , though alas not without parallel in the world .
That is not the case .
I will now go into more detail on the conditions that we consider necessary in order to bring about a successful Single European Sky .
The European Union makes its views plain on this subject in its contacts with third countries , and in international fora such as the UN Commission on Human Rights .
That is why I think , Mr Poos , that your report is an extremely important element , which will spark off the wide @-@ ranging debate about to open on the institutional framework of the EU , its effectiveness and its democratic legitimacy .
It is one of the principle duties of this people &apos;s Parliament to see that the interests of the citizens and taxpayers of this united Europe are not forgotten .
But it is equally important that the Member States should acknowledge what you in European Parliament and those working on the CFSP have long understood : that mere intergovernmentalism can be a recipe for weakness and mediocrity , for a European foreign policy of the lowest @-@ common denominator .
Democracy is something which we all want for the future and it can only be achieved if it can be shown that there is also an element of solidarity .
Is the level of relations which the Council has with the United States of America such that it does not allow it to raise the issue of the human rights of these five prisoners with the government of the United States ?
But this presidency has been a success for Europe , and you , President @-@ in @-@ Office , deserve the credit .
The debate is suspended and will be resumed at 3 p.m.
We need as a counterweight an effective , jointly coordinated policy against mass unemployment .
There is still a hint of sadness in that Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo cannot yet join them , but in December , we expect the Commission to acknowledge the huge progress that Albania has made and to see that Bosnia and Herzegovina has also made a certain amount of improvement .
It is a weapon used to silence the freest , most broad @-@ minded opinions .
The overall effect for those inhabiting the eurozone has , however , been very small .
We shall run the risk of producing a chaotic Europe which will place enlargement at risk .
As regards the Armenian genocide , it absolutely must be recognised by Turkey .
The &apos; EU protein deficit : what solution for a long @-@ standing problem ? &apos; report from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has come up with a number of excellent solutions for dealing with the protein crop deficit in the EU , such as revising the Blair House Agreement with the USA , which permits protein crops to be imported duty free from the United States .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , forests play an essential role in preserving the balance of our ecology and are a sustainable resource , albeit in the long term .
On the other hand , consent issues are well regulated in all Member States and applicant countries , so the added value of binding provisions at EU @-@ level is , in my view , very doubtful .
Would such a move not be totally inconsistent with those sections of the Commission communication that we are discussing here today , including the following :
We must all strive to build confidence .
Hedge funds , open real @-@ estate funds and other retail products should therefore be included in the UCITS III Directive - a task that still lies ahead .
The joint action of 28 November also introduces measures to implement a moratorium on the production of anti @-@ personnel landmines and emphasizes the need , as has been stated by a number of speakers , for early ratification of the convention .
The EU is an area of solidarity , and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) is a part of that .
Mr President , since November 2000 , the Commission has taken a number of important steps towards strengthening poverty reduction in Community development cooperation .
The response I got was that China will be the most powerful country in the world ; many of the developing countries will have changed ; America will still be powerful , but not as powerful as it is today ; India and Brazil will be very powerful .
So we have really worked through this document and I am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document .
This is why this article will allow the sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources .
At this juncture , I would also like to point out that those who always claim that the European integration project is an anti @-@ social project could perhaps tone it down a little from today onwards .
This is an essential tool for communicating how Member States treat European law .
This agreement should enable Ukraine and the EU to benefit mutually from the scientific and technical progress made through their research programmes , at the same time enabling the transfer of knowledge to benefit the scientific community , industry and Europeans .
Grossetête recommendation for second reading ( A5 @-@ 0080 / 1999 )
Rail transport must be able to develop as a fully fledged partner in order to achieve the objectives of the common transport policy .
You are satisfied on many points , but not always 100 % .
We intend to keep a very watchful eye on this and , if we detect any hold @-@ ups , then we will bring pressure to bear on the Indonesian government .
They have learned nothing from the dramatic consequences of the restrictive policy squeezing Europe &apos;s citizens .
Enlargement is thus our opportunity to change our operating rules and ensure that they are based on greater transparency and stronger guarantees of the rights of citizenship , and also streamline our decision @-@ making .
Addressing barriers to EU exports in third countries also accounts for the bulk of the potential to improve the competitive position of EU industry .
I last heard on the news that it was close to 110 dollars a barrel .
Since the resolution is not only a political statement by Parliament , but also offers moral support for those who are jailed , we would like to propose the inclusion in our resolution of the names of four former presidential candidates who are still in the custody of the KGB .
As I said , this was my intention , and I signalled this request .
One of the most important matters to be considered will be , no doubt , the competitiveness of Europe .
Therefore we should not here choose the formula minus one but plus one .
. Mr President , I wish to begin by saying that it is a pleasure to see Mr Milinkevich here .
At the same time , the OSCE is today respected as an independent arbiter in assessing the democratic running of elections , and democratic standards .
Nevertheless , we have carried on regardless , almost as if nothing had ever happened .
I should like to point out that we have had three interesting examples of this in the short interval between the Commission communication and the report .
12 .
Freedom of religion is in fact virtually non @-@ existent .
It is far from ideal that manufacturers should have to juggle different regulations , and it is also highly regrettable that we were unable to gain approval for our proposal that this issue should finally be resolved by 2008 at the latest .
The Rules of Procedure are just the same for the Conference of Presidents , Mr Ford !
Nevertheless , for certain Members States , the proposed Directive which is currently on the table goes too far : they see its objectives as overly ambitious .
We remain convinced that the Lomé agreement still offers the best chance for lasting peace in Sierra Leone .
The rapporteur is himself proof that Europe is not racist .
It has not been possible so far to apply it generally to all the Member States , which is precisely why it is representative of the disagreements .
These prohibited the laundering of money from drug trafficking , and obligations were imposed primarily on financial service providers , or in other words on banks .
That means the continuation of a policy whereby support for rural development is used as part of a strategy to contain common agricultural policy costs , to liberalise agricultural markets and to negotiate with the World Trade Organisation .
I believe that complementarity and EU coordination are among our most important tools for increasing the effectiveness and impact of EU development cooperation on the ground .
Next , the need for improved mobility between partner countries and the European Union since there is no better way to promote European values than through sharing experience person to person .
Throughout all these years , it was the foreign policy section of the Budget that was under the greatest pressure ; this was partly in consequence of events around the world and also because the European Union has actually started to take more joint responsibility , and the resources have to be provided for it to do so .
This amendment was voted on by the Committee .
That is , in actual fact , our main concern at the moment .
Spain has the most effective insurance system currently in place in Europe .
Finally , it will become possible to provide systematic feedback on accidents .
If we came forward with a definitive proposal to tackle these problems , we could make Europe very relevant by addressing the real fears of the citizens across a whole host of areas .
Earlier today I was in Berlin , taking part in an interview with Chancellor Merkel on a popular German television programme , in which the public asked us questions such as how much Germany stands to lose from enlargement and what companies would leave .
A book &apos;s search for its readers is involved and mysterious .
in writing . - ( PT ) The European Global Navigation Satellite System ( GNSS ) , as the first Community infrastructure and due to its space @-@ related and technological nature , can only be achieved through a common will .
We all know that it will , at best , be a very big task to bring the Commission &apos; s ponderous and high @-@ handed bureaucracy up to the standard we require of public administration in our home countries .
Furthermore , no Member State totally escapes the risk of disturbances , even if some international matches are more sensitive than others and the supporters of some clubs or national teams are seemingly easier to control than others .
That was a shame , since the problems that the directive tackles had not disappeared by far - on the contrary , in the period of enlargement of the EU .
A Tacis programme has been developed to fight against the consequences of the drying of the Aral Sea .
It was very important for us to feel your support throughout the entire past five months .
Thirdly , it deals with reducing traffic congestion , particularly for road traffic , and alternative means of access and mobility in the urban areas , where better public transport is a very high priority .
Strict standards can be prescribed for new plants since the new technology can be used here .
In spite of this , France nonetheless managed to take the decision it did .
before the final vote
&lt; empty &gt;
Mr Bangemann , basically , I cannot fully understand what you are saying .
This could be a panel of four experts in the field of impact assessment , who simply look at the impact assessments carried out by the Commission and those carried out in this House , and who then issue recommendations on that basis .
. – The purpose of the Europass is not to serve the workers , but to make it easier for employers to compare job applicants and select those who , with the lowest demands , will &apos; yield &apos; fastest , whatever their country of origin .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this House has provided a major impetus to the development of European political parties .
There is a second factor that is also analysed in our report on the first ten years of Economic and Monetary Union .
We know that the European Union will not control the impact of the enlargement and monetary union will be at risk , without a change in the balance and operation of its institutions .
I more than share your concern and while we are closely following the deterioration of the human rights situation in El Salvador , supporting the initiatives organized in the country to defend respect for human rights , what the Commission is actually able to do is have more of a presence in support of this project because outbreaks of violence are occurring , as always in electoral periods .
A lot of European worthies will be jockeying for front seats at the opening of the Games .
We have seen how there was confusion for weeks , with debates taking place in the national capitals , but not in the European capital , in Brussels .
I will make a special effort on energy efficiency .
We can undertake to implement it as soon as possible . We think that to aim to pay out the assistance in the middle of August , at a time when we all know the difficulties with budgetary procedures , is at best a risky idea .
In the light of this , in particular , we cannot but support the Commission &apos;s initiative .
That is of benefit both to European taxpayers , who obtain better value for money , and to the innumerable companies that are now being given the opportunity to compete for contracts throughout the EU .
I shall be brief .
We have no knowledge of any vaccines .
The White Paper programme has been practically finalised .
Nevertheless , the current situation must not prevent us from trying to improve it .
The railway workers are going to play an important role in interoperability and their interests must be addressed in the text of the directive .
Why is there not a service in Brussels which can make reports of sittings available the next day , as in Strasbourg ?
I would like , however , to point out several flaws in the Commission &apos;s proposal .
The priority , however , should not relate exclusively to security of supply , but we should at the same time focus on a sustainable , efficient energy policy that makes Europe increasingly self @-@ sufficient in energy terms and thus independent of external pressures that may have an influence , and at times a strong one , on the EU &apos;s commitment to the promotion of democracy , human rights and peace .
However , I can assure you that , as far as the Italian Presidency is concerned , it is our express intention to safeguard the rights of parliaments , and not just the European Parliament but parliaments in general .
This could lead to GMO products evading the thorough controls , time limits and evaluation proposed in this directive .
That is why I voted in favour of this report .
Mercury brings to mind thousands of men and women who lived from it for centuries , hundreds of names and faces , friends with whom I have worked as a Socialist Member of Parliament over the last 30 years , explaining to them , persuading them and supporting them with alternatives in order to overcome the paradox that human progress , which was getting rid of mercury , appeared to be heralding their disappearance .
Promoting training for our workers and investing in their lifelong employability are sustainable ways of achieving greater competitiveness in the European economy .
Secondly , there is education , education and education .
Catalonia , one of the most Europhile nations in Europe , was treated with contempt .
That is why self @-@ contained breathing equipment is needed .
First of all , I have noticed that people have cold feet about laying down specific , let alone European , objectives and benchmarks .
Well , that poverty in the world be combated and that we obtain more aid , more trade and more democracy .
The Commission had planned to spend ECU 150 million over five years .
What is more , the existence of an instrument providing an alternative for minor inventions means that the level of invention required can be interpreted more strictly .
After all , you cannot just simply label every victim as innocent and anyone who is on top as guilty at that particular moment .
CITES is a science @-@ based convention , as has already been underlined , and sets out detailed criteria for determining the level of protection that should apply to individual species .
There has been a case of this nature in the UK , and there has also been a recent case in Italy .
We have always said that this is absolutely crucial to the development of the information society , and we are now gratified to note that competition has developed among service providers , as a result of which interfaces have become more user @-@ friendly and charges have been reduced . That is not the case everywhere , Mr President , and Mrs Read was right to criticise this state of affairs .
Here we are talking about ECU 280m , of which ECU 180m are for ACP countries .
&lt; empty &gt;
The services are therefore not cheap enough .
I would like to say that this action is used by the authorities in Tiraspol to intimidate Chişinău at a time when the new government which took office after last year &apos;s elections would like to move closer to the European Union and also resolve the Transnistrian conflict .
In 2006 , I closed 41 inquiries in this way .
I would also like to give my compliments to the rapporteur , who had to deal with shifting majorities in the committee , which led to there being light and dark aspects to this report .
‘ If the Commission is not in a position to make such a statement at the end of Parliament ’ s vote on its proposal , it shall inform the President or the committee responsible as to when it will be in a position to do so ; the proposal shall then be placed on the draft agenda of the first part @-@ session thereafter . ’
Many of the Member States &apos; traditional instruments have moved to European level , and everyone recognises that economic policies are an issue of common interest at European level .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I will say in closing that , generally speaking , I can support Parliament &apos;s resolution and I look forward to further very constructive cooperation in our common effort to combat climate change .
The idea that a list would be as good as a textbook for terrorist attacks is downright naïve .
However , with our model solutions we must be very careful to ensure that a centralistic form of European economic governance does not slip in through the back door and erode the last remnants of national sovereignty .
Mr President , we meet here today to discuss an important question .
What is needed is investment in conversion research and conversion projects .
Third , coherence : we have to ask ourselves whether our system of fiscal rules is complete .
That being said , I am monitoring very closely how the political situation is developing , and I will not disguise from you the fact that even I , being very conscious of the dangers of a chaotic situation , am slowly beginning to grow impatient .
Now we see the Federalist majority in the European Parliament taking the view that the Heads of State or Government undertook in 2002 to maintain the first @-@ pillar agricultural funds in full at the same level until 2013 and that that undertaking should be respected .
France recently gave us a lamentable example of this .
While the asylum package , which should define a new , more up @-@ to @-@ date frame of reference , is stuck in the Council , a different view has emerged in the Member States regarding the effectiveness of the asylum procedures based on the rules already in force .
There is no doubt that what many commentators are saying about these latest events is true : namely that the country is at a crossroads which we regard as critical .
When , as in the discussion with the United States , I point out that well over half of transactions with Russia and other countries are now carried out in euros - for the euro is a driving force , it can only go on to be used in sectors currently outside its scope such as energy or other sectors because we are being carried that way by the momentum - then Europe is heeded , then Europe is a genuine political entity and not only an economic entity , even though we are talking about purely economic matters .
Commissioner Almunia , I would ask you to brief your colleague Mr McCreevy on the measures which are necessary and which we must now adopt .
It is to be hoped that initiatives of this kind will also be adopted by our new neighbours as speedily as possible , so that production might also be increased in this way in the Union ’ s neighbouring regions .
It can happen in political life that you hit upon a good idea later than events really require .
Similar situations have arisen in the past .
I would remind colleagues that the last financial perspective was not agreed until the equivalent of the March Council 2006 , rather than the December Council 2005 .
We don &apos;t have hordes of media folk standing outside to report this joyful news , but I think it bears mentioning .
A further highly negative aspect of the allocation of the grants is the bureaucratic financing procedure , which is currently seriously behind schedule . This must of necessity be rectified .
This shows that the aim is not to achieve better service for the benefit of the user , but to actually create , using liberal dogma , the internal market .
Like my fellow members of the committee , I am persuaded that a graduated model , with Member States being treated differently and greater account taken of previous achievements , is in any case preferable to aiming for a reduction across the board .
The rule of law is indeed under threat in Russia .
At the end of the current programming period , we will be able to go further , and , at the 2001 donors ’ conference , we announced EUR 140 million for Colombia for the 2001 – 2006 period , the largest sum that we spend on any one country in Latin America .
I am very keen to move forward with our important strategic partnership with China , a country that is rapidly emerging as a global player across the board , and is now , amongst other things , our second largest trading partner .
I would also like to thank all my colleagues .
We have this crisis because both were undermined in the past .
You did not comment on this .
In this sense , I would stress that the Commission &apos;s aim is not to harmonise prices as such , but it does have the further @-@ reaching , more fundamental goal of guaranteeing the smooth functioning of the internal market and , in particular , of allowing consumers to purchase vehicles directly or indirectly wherever they are cheaper .
In view of standard practice within the Barcelona process , it is entirely understandable that the European Parliament , as an exceedingly important player in the Euro @-@ Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly , will be appropriately involved in the debate on future steps .
There is no other solution .
I believe , however , that it will be some time before this country reaches the desired level of democracy , since in order for that to happen , appointments will have to be made through open competitions rather than being allocated to relatives .
I have received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 40 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The psychological impact on farmers , not just in Great Britain but also in Ireland , is a matter of great concern .
Moreover , the Commission does this and has the nerve to claim that it means well and refers to concern for the health of the Ålanders .
I can only repeat what I said earlier .
The objective - and I think that this is the fundamental objective - is to maintain and improve air quality .
I would also warn against assuming in advance that if there is agreement in the Council on drastic spending cuts , Parliament will automatically approve them .
It is a question of water provision and &apos; chill @-@ out rooms &apos; and so on , and not a question of &apos; shooting rooms &apos; , which is a completely different matter .
Thank you .
Now is not the time for pusillanimity and tentative dealings .
We also think that a legal personality is needed to bring the process of political union to a conclusion and that the process of the constitutionalisation of the Union will also require it to have its own legal personality .
At the end of February , I myself presented to the Committee on Budgetary Control the Council &apos;s recommendations on the discharge to the Commission for the implementation of the budget .
Finally , we call on the Commission to transpose the Union &apos;s innovation policy into an action plan with specific objectives and measurable targets .
In the last session in Strasbourg we had another regulation that had also run out last December and this should not happen .
That is not the Europe for us !
This is a standard text approved in many other recent regulations .
But they cannot be , as they often are , the exclusive preserve of a self @-@ elected technocracy , a syndicate of civil servants or , worse still , the coalition of political parties .
The two @-@ way committee proposed by the Commission gives the Member States the necessary guarantee of involvement in the process .
With the new wording of its proposals on port services , the Commission is trying to reflect the legitimate concerns of all parties .
( The Minutes were approved )
Let us not accept the addition of new types of competition between workers , on top of those introduced by the appalling Bolkestein Directive .
Why do we not enter into the merits of the results ?
We therefore need to increase our aid to the global fund that is responsible for a very large proportion of the work to combat tuberculosis , malaria and HIV in the poorer areas of the world .
It could even be described as the fundamental concern of health ministers .
It needs to be recovered .
The EU must now suspend the Association Agreement .
Suppression of the free media , muzzling of the opposition and cheating during the referendum itself meant that this fearful outcome was inevitable .
All these legal instruments will have simultaneous application from 1 July 2005 .
Even excellent individuals do not succeed on their own merits , however , if their background is felt to be less than favourable .
The Loyalist Paramilitaries , the UVF , the UDA and the Republican Paramilitaries , the IRA are all at this .
All it does is to transfer the line of command away from NATO in the national capitals towards the EU &apos;s new politico @-@ military structures .
When a sports team is a business , the team itself and its sponsors set increasing profits as their objective and , consequently , every sacrifice and every victory won at all costs by the athlete is a means of maximising profits .
I must ask the Commissioner to keep his eye on the future development of water policy , because climate change in particular is set to confront us with new problems , and the importance of water to the economy and to human life is set to increase sharply .
Mr Cappato also criticised the non @-@ application of the law .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the discussions between Parliament and the Council on the adoption of the regulation establishing a European food facility led to the decision not to use the funds available under heading 2 of the budget to finance this facility , contrary to what was proposed by the Commission .
In this case , the word &apos; terminal &apos; is used in the widest sense , to include rail yards , port terminals , logistical platforms , roads , railways , and so on , which are indispensable for the proper functioning of freight corridors and the transport system as a whole .
In many cases this has resulted in legal disputes which were heart @-@ rending for both parents and children .
This has been a core objective for us since the very outset .
As we are all aware , the environmental consequences of air transport have recently attracted a great deal of interest .
Mr President , a policeman stops an articulated lorry in Germany because it is going too fast .
Because this is causing major problems to the mobility of our citizens , particularly the disabled and the invalided , in the areas I have referred to .
What do you expect ?
We can only welcome such a development , but it does imply a transformation of both our social and our economic systems .
I have asked the Members of this Parliament who raised the issue to be aware that it is very difficult to adopt a balanced approach to this problem if an immediate solution is demanded . I realise that the attitude adopted will have to include an element of phasing and that it is very difficult for a solution to this issue to be based on a diktat .
We therefore wish to hold &apos; one @-@ on @-@ one &apos; negotiations and not &apos; one @-@ on @-@ four &apos; as is done in other areas such as the North @-@ South America free trade zone .
I question why the Commission is putting forward proposals in a sphere that , to date , has been an area of national competence .
The aim of the Black Sea Synergy is to develop regional cooperation between the EU and the region , as well as within the region .
I am aware that this could set off a fire alarm and would therefore be grateful if you would allow me to make this point in advance of the report by the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council .
Let us also recognise that this is an international problem .
I just wanted to explain that .
A multi @-@ year action plan will be adopted to guide our common effort in this area .
The deletion of this article should be seen against the background of the Council &apos;s statement that the adoption of the directive does not create a precedent for any future decisions on tax incentives .
Mr Duff spoke about the trade regulation being done within three months .
This text allowed for the alignment of the system applicable to foreign workers and thus tackled social dumping .
As things stand today , I am bound to say that we cannot forecast when such a scenario will be ready .
Since then , I have been the rapporteur and am glad that this programme has been really extremely successful .
Therefore this German initiative - one for which I am very pleased to be the rapporteur - is aimed at trying to bring the matter effectively and efficiently to a conclusion .
To sum up , the European Union should put intense pressure upon Liberia to end its support for forces such as the URF .
Like many earlier speakers , I particularly welcome the proposed regulation on the rights and obligations of passengers .
In the course of 2001 , China greatly increased its exports of ceramics .
Resistance to antibiotics is not solely linked to their use in meat production .
There should be a natural solution to this in the future with the various parties concerned working closely together .
Thirdly , within the context of cohesion funding , talk of territorial cohesion in my region is somewhat ironic , since we were excluded from cohesion funding from its inception , while our neighbour in the Irish Republic was included .
What is at stake here is controlling the immigration of workers and maintaining social , economic and political stability in the European Union .
It was not a foregone conclusion that this debate could be revived , but we worked hard at it and , in late May , succeeded in holding a discussion of this issue between Ministers for Foreign Affairs for the first time in more than a year .
Mr President , I would like to point out that we discussed this matter a few months ago . During that debate , important issues were raised .
Anyone like me who has spent time listening and talking to those people cannot doubt their despair or their passionate desire for peace , and their genuine desire to exercise their culture , language and tradition as Kurds .
We have to lay the foundations for shared management of migratory flows by adopting a generous and united approach to the issue of the movement of persons in the Mediterranean area .
The solution for this is that these projects require much better preparation .
To ensure that this programme does not impact on our monetary policy stance , we re @-@ absorb all the liquidity injected .
What action will the Council take to do something about this tragic situation ?
It is being proposed , with good reason , to delete paragraph 2c of Article 3 by means of Amendment No 52 .
There are many reports of official and unofficial acts of intimidation against members of the legal community and abuse of the Anti @-@ Terrorist Act to persecute political opponents .
the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon ,
in writing . - ( HU ) During the past two years , I have voiced on several occasions , both in the plenary sessions of the European Parliament and in its various forums , the dangers of cyanide @-@ based mining .
This would make it easier for the Member States to legally implement the cofinancing for rural home renovation .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
( BG ) Mr President , I naturally voted for the resolution on Ukraine .
in writing . - ( SV ) Junilistan accepts that the EU has a central role to play in trade policy .
What is Portugal &apos;s situation at the moment ?
Aid directed to that country should not , in normal circumstances , be used for that purpose .
My question is : &apos; what have you been doing for four years ? &apos;
The report clearly highlights the problems of nuclear power , the transport of radioactive material and the lack of democracy .
We call on every political group in this House to support this approach and expect the Commission and the Council to respect our view and to act accordingly .
Many in my constituency saw our Prime Minister &apos;s return from Florence in the same light as they saw Mr Chamberlain &apos;s return from Munich half a century ago . Not peace in our time , but beef in our time .
You are applying a double standard here , and it is not acceptable .
We asked for a feasibility study to be carried out .
There is no doubt whatsoever about the position of the Commission .
Mr Chancellor , we welcome the Austrian Presidency and count on you .
. Mr President , violations of human rights are an everyday occurrence in Belarus .
I understand this concern , but I would like to say to you that companies are now clearly getting through the rough patch they have suffered over recent years .
Finally , I would express my total agreement with the need for the World Bank clearly to identify and publicly disclose the development benefits before financing is committed .
A security partnership with Russia will only function if it is not at the expense of existing alliances and of keeping the USA out of Europe . This is a condition of a partnership of this kind .
I wonder why it took so long before they were given a proposal to which to respond .
Finally , there is the Economic and Social Committee , the only area where we do have a problem .
I agree , of course , that a recommendation does not have the power of a binding instrument .
For that reason we must make a clear statement from this Parliament that we make both our short term and our long term aid subject to certain conditions .
EU livestock production systems are important for maintaining livelihoods .
We are already seeing stormy debates on whether it will be the CAP or cohesion policy that will be plundered .
I regret the fact that Israel , a democratic country , pays little attention to the damage some of its actions create through the eyes of international public opinion and limits itself to damage limitation only afterwards .
Mr President , Commissioner , may I add my congratulations ?
This would be tantamount to paying for planting without any intention of achieving a crop , and that is why we support the rapporteur .
Furthermore , Israel is the only democratic country in the Middle East .
What is clear is that Zimbabwe is in chaos .
This is an act of disrespect towards all of us and towards the people of Europe .
I find the same thing here in this debate in this Chamber .
author . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , Mr Chichester , of course the prices can go down as well as up , but I think almost all of us here would agree that given the scarce energy resources and their limited availability , and the growing competition worldwide over access to , and shares in , these resources , it is likely that prices will remain very high over the long term .
We met the former opposition leader , who is now the Head of Government .
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection . - ( RO ) The Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection has formulated its position based on a certain reality : the negative effects resulting from the breach of antitrust legislation can be felt economically very often at the end of the commercial chain , affecting end consumers and small enterprises .
- Madam President , it is always a pleasure to be present with you in explanations of votes .
I voted for the European Parliament resolution on the mobilisation of the EGF for granting aid to the redundant workers .
The main job is still to be done and , to quote something said by an American a couple of weeks ago : &apos; We did not cross the Rubicon in order to sit there fishing &apos; .
I would like to conclude by making an observation with regard to the Middle East , where an escalating conflict is claiming victims in Palestine on a daily basis .
The European Union fully supports the long @-@ standing principle of budgetary discipline .
Mrs Gomes raised important challenging points in relation to human rights , democracy and development within Africa .
We are , as is well known , only at the beginning of the debate on the reform of governance .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , unfortunately , the negative developments in Zimbabwe are in inverse proportion to the degree of international attention focussed on this country since the rigged presidential elections in March .
I believe that we should continue measures aimed at extending the scope of unitary patent protection , so that it ultimately covers the entire territory of the European Union .
But , they also make a point which we must take on board here in Parliament .
We have said that a fast track is possible for Parliament , but only if our expectations concerning procedures for the next budget negotiations are guaranteed .
I take note of the effort that you have made in this direction : whether it is in recognising , I hope definitively , the role of Parliament , or in modifying the composition of the team that will accompany you in the coming years .
Let me make it quite clear , the most dangerous aspect of the transport of radioactive material today are the demonstrators on the periphery who cut the railway lines in half , dig out railway embankments , and do other similar things . At the moment , some of them are staging a &apos; lie @-@ in &apos; on the railway tracks in Germany .
For this reason , we should not oppose the idea that eurozone countries need to reduce their excess fiscal burdens .
I therefore welcome the proposal that you have just made , Commissioner , but I am anxious to stress that this proposal must remain ambitious .
I therefore hope that the Council unreservedly and speedily implements Parliament &apos;s proposal before the 2009 elections .
The compromise reached with the Council means that fishermen can carry on as before as long as they do not make a profit .
But that must not be forgotten .
The background to terrorism involves social policy , and the remedy for it likewise involves social policy .
The major challenges presented by globalisation , the economic and financial crisis and global warming will cause Europeans to work even more closely together to provide an effective defence for our shared values and our interests in the world .
The second remark is the image of the European Union : bad , not to say terrible .
Mr President , the Group of the European Liberal , Democratic and Reformist Party clearly supports Mr Oostlander &apos;s report and I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on having so dispassionately followed up on the essential aspects of the studies and proposals which we have already submitted to Parliament , especially during the previous legislature .
The way out appears to be to make a common declaration with the Council that spells out the sort of investments associated with housing that are eligible for ERDF co @-@ financing .
Only time and the first cases of matters going wrong can reveal whether the rules on traceability have been secure enough .
Question No 1 by ( H @-@ 0248 / 01 )
The WEU depends on NATO capacities and NATO logistics in many respects .
We expect a response from the Commission . It is a pity that we cannot have a response from the Council , but the request is contained in the resolution .
While China dominates our import markets , our businesses are losing out in China because of counterfeiting and market @-@ access barriers amounting to EUR 55 million a day in lost business opportunities .
I am talking about the introduction of a compulsory non @-@ EU origin label , to be applied to raw materials too .
Yes , it has to be done properly and sensitively , but it should be pushed forward .
Large countries , and many smaller ones too , often tyrannise others through language .
The next item is the report ( A4 @-@ 0139 / 99 ) by Mr Valverde López , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , on the proposal for a Council Regulation allowing voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco @-@ management and audit scheme ( COM ( 98 ) 0622 - C4 @-@ 0683 / 98 @-@ 98 / 0303 ( SYN ) ) .
And does he think that this should be applied in all countries ?
The agricultural markets , too , need budgetary and general policy frameworks and rules .
I note , moreover , that the final proposal is even higher than the initial proposals of the Commission , which it should be aware of .
In the midst of our work for ever closer integration of the European Union , the Georgian @-@ Russian conflict has come like a bolt from the blue to remind us that force makes decisions even in the 21st century .
I should like to hand you the many thousands of signatures that have been collected for this purpose .
( PL ) Mr President , some words of acknowledgement for the rapporteur , Mr Blokland ; as always , once again he has done some excellent work .
Then when he comes home , he infects his wife and brings the disease into the village .
All over Europe , the costs of medicines and health insurance are rising , and everybody is trying to find ways of bringing them down .
Parliament has pointed in this direction , making a decisive contribution to encourage the EU to adopt a position in line with its underlying values .
When we were there we met the Chief @-@ Executive @-@ designate , Mr Tung .
The European Union strongly supports the UN as an institution .
Yes , I believe we must look at the situation regarding the standards for GMOs .
( HU ) Commissioner , it is very important that the Council of Europe has a mechanism that was developed and has been functioning for decades , monitored by the European Court of Human Rights , and that the European Union will share it .
Sports shoes have been excluded , but how do we define sports shoes ?
Where the conventional railway network is concerned , the Commission proposed that a common representative body should provide , and regularly update , a facility to help monitor progress .
This can only be seen as positive even though it requires greater human resources and therefore an increase in costs , which , I believe , we must contribute to .
Our number one concern must be to forestall any distortions in the single market by creating a new European monetary system - an EMS II - which seeks to keep real exchange rates within a certain range .
Commissioner , I should like to ask you one very brief question .
Finally , I would like to see a link with the Gothenburg Summit and the ecological dimension , which is the next step .
Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating the Finnish Presidency , both for its work on human rights and for attending this plenary .
This practice and its danger have been clearly outlined by the rapporteur .
Because the problem is worldwide : China , Indonesia , the Philippines and Peru fish .
That concludes Question Time .
If this were the case , then the feed would definitely be safe .
The situation in the USA , however , is very different . There , the number of these aeroplanes will rise to about 1500 by the year 2000 .
The President gives the floor in the order the questions are asked , whether by a show of hands or by pressing the button .
I also wish to support Wrocław in its bid to host the headquarters of the European Institute of Technology .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , in the debate that we are having at present , it is important not to get everything mixed up and not to confuse all the various responsibilities .
- ( DA ) This report shows with frightening clarity that the European Union is progressively being turned into a federal state , with disastrous consequences for national independence , including Danish democracy .
Naturally , the whole electoral process had its awkward moments , which , moreover , we had already anticipated in the preliminary statement , but there were also moments of concern , for example the arrest of Mohaqui Nasab – a journalist who edits a weekly publication on women ’ s rights – which was declared illegal even by the representative of the Media Commission of the Afghan authorities .
Europe has always had an important role to play throughout the world .
The Commission will thus be a party to the compromise reached between the Council and Parliament in the conciliation procedure .
Firstly , rejecting the compromise would mean postponing the implementation of the networks and thus delaying the anticipated benefits for the economy and employment .
To attain these goals , it is essential for education and vocational training to be treated as a long @-@ term common political priority , which can only be realised with the participation and commitment of all stakeholders , the EU institutions and those involved at local and regional level .
However , I should like to draw attention in this regard to two issues that are important from a development cooperation point of view .
In a democracy , it is inconceivable for electoral law to be changed between the two rounds of an election .
In fact , the entire Italian beef industry is extremely concerned by the proposal , and not just because of the maximum limits it imposes on travelling time .
At present , Member States provide technical equipment on a voluntary basis .
I have seen this programme and it is in fact so well @-@ organised and so neat that the alternative that we can offer the refugees when they return looks much less organised .
It is therefore desirable to call upon the Member States to make better use of the available forms of cooperation across regional borders .
Do you have an opinion on this ?
It is absolutely incredible that this criticism should be made when the reduction in tax affects citizens rather than companies .
It is a common market for people . EU citizens , as we know , are travelling more than ever , not least as tourists .
The internal market is not , nor should it be , a merely bureaucratic structure .
The simultaneous adoption of measures to promote the training of qualified crew members in Europe , which is now declining steadily , would be equally beneficial , in my view .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , industry does actually produce equipment that is very suitable for the varied purposes of the information society for elderly and disabled users , too .
The data protection directive must be incorporated into national law by 1 October .
The criticism is based on the fact that none of these agreements promotes sustainable fishing and that they are also implemented in a way that does not comply with the FAO ’ s code of conduct .
Over forty years of communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe have resulted in an unfortunate and artificial division of Europe .
Thank you .
We must draw the necessary conclusions from the high degree of integration we have reached and prepare for future enlargement .
I acknowledge the need for sustained economic competitiveness to provide the very resources required for a high @-@ quality environment .
After all , we do not want to give the Commission too many powers , for instance over regulations on labelling and oenological practices .
So , Mr Evans rightly referred to the need for fair treatment , for a bilateral but not unbalanced approach : if we are behaving ourselves , the others should behave as well .
This is why co @-@ determination and employee participation is incredibly important in a society which seeks to be innovative .
The Barcelona Summit last November achieved notable results for the future .
Mr President , the resolution before Parliament derives its legal justification from an institutional framework where it is not hard to acknowledge the commitment of the European institutions , particularly the European Parliament , to the important and necessary action to stamp out one of the most dangerous and vile forms of criminal trafficking in existence : the trafficking of human beings .
It is quite amazing that the USA and Canada have so far refused to recognize that leghold traps are inhumane .
However , the focus on energy efficiency will be continued in all Member States through their national action plans and this is extremely important .
The Minsk regime hopes that , in time , the Belarus story will fade in importance in the international media .
I also support the stipulation of consumption limits - but these must be realistic limits .
Hence , a thorny issue , such as the right to return of the Palestinian refugees , could have been presented by the Palestinian Authority to its own constituents as an issue involving sensitive details which had to be dealt with in conjunction with the Israeli Government on the proviso , of course , that that government agreed , in time , to Palestinian demands that were easier to accept .
Finally , the externalisation and the approach that we are advocating in company with several honourable Members from all parts of this House - and I pay them tribute - is certainly not a departure from the concept or practice of a permanent , independent and competent European public service .
. I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague Mr Garcia @-@ Margallo y Marfil on the situation of the European economy as part of the preparatory report on the broad economic policy guidelines for 2006 , which underlines the conditions necessary for sustainable economic growth .
Women play an important role in universities , research institutes and the private sector .
Smart and effective sanctions need to be linked to a structural and systemic response .
People are right to look for answers to these questions .
Unfortunately , we will then have to wait for the result of these checks .
I would therefore like to mention it here .
Just as before , agricultural export subsidies are in place , ruining , among other things , the development of African markets and contributing to the refugee problems about which we are always complaining .
The rights to life , health , housing and food are at the top of the list of violations .
I hope that this reciprocity will soon be properly regulated in the partnership agreement , without all the political emotions triggered by this project .
Nothing more can , of course , be demanded in the negotiations themselves than is required of the Member States .
These challenges relate , essentially , to five areas considered to be strategic by the Commission : ( i ) employment ; ( ii ) research and innovation ; ( iii ) climate change and energy ; ( iv ) education and ( v ) the fight against poverty .
My oral amendment is : &apos; and to promote the application of EU environmental standards to large @-@ scale mining and water barrage projects &apos; .
Indeed , to me they look more like the type of document that is written ahead of meetings in the hope of reaching agreement .
Could the rapporteur , Mr Albertini , give us his opinion ?
... We are members of a parliament . We do not spend our time patting ourselves on the back ; we take our parliamentary role seriously , as Mr Cox has done for five years .
It was we Europeans who opened up the world through navigation : the Scandinavians in the North , the Portuguese and Spanish towards America , Africa and Asia , the Dutch , the Danish , the English and the French have sailed all the oceans in ships built on our lands and in our shipyards .
Mr President , although it is late , we are discussing a subject which , as was said a few moments ago , is extremely important .
Madam President , I voted against the resolution establishing a permanent crisis mechanism for the eurozone , because in Ireland and Greece , we see the reality that such mechanisms are to bail out a crisis @-@ ridden financial system dominated by speculators and assorted profit @-@ seeking sharks at the expense of working people , pensioners and the poor .
The incorporation of these issues into all the relevant policies must focus mainly on access issues , access to goods , services and buildings , and must be linked to the principle of &apos; design for all &apos; expressed in the Commission communication which immediately preceded this communication .
Frankly , we never enforce restrictions about such matters in our trade agreements with China .
There is , however , one thing I would to make very clear to this House , and this also applies of course to the Commission and the Member States . If we are to give an agency new remits , then we also need to consider where the money for carrying out those tasks is to come from .
Madam President , I have a confession to make .
Can budgetary resources be increased , or must we be content to act within the limited framework of current funding ?
I was saying that I fully share Mr Alavanos &apos; view that we must strengthen wind power even more , especially in regions where conditions are favourable , such as the Cyclades , as he himself mentioned , but also in other regions of Europe .
The fact is that we now have to vote in a different way for a different structure , and hopefully get it right , as well as deal with enlargement .
The choice of sufferers inevitably raises ethical problems and problems of not discriminating between persons contaminated by the Aids virus .
A key instrument in this regard is the regular human rights dialogue between the EU missions in Hanoi and the Government of Vietnam .
The Committee on Research proposed a form of revision clause ; unfortunately , this was not adopted .
Then people say to me : yes , but it will be transparent .
I think that is wrong .
I expect that the findings of the annual reports concerning the agencies , to be published later , will follow the same trend as in recent years .
I will make no bones about it : as internationalists we defend the European idea against those who want to make the EU a military power and a purely economic alliance .
Conversation therapy and other such forms of treatment can only supplement other forms of punishment , such as prison .
Proposals to protect the vulnerable have been made in recent years and although the situation has improved , it is worth noting that tragic consequences will ensue from policymakers shirking their responsibilities .
In this case , it is an undeniable fact that these 33 defenders of the Copts were treated inhumanely in prison .
Secondly transparency and proportionality should be central to the future CAP .
AIDS in the developing countries
This is why we , on the Left , view your programme with confidence .
This will mean that at last we can welcome into a renovated Europe all the Member States which communist ideology had kept artificially separate .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of my group I should firstly like to thank all the rapporteurs involved in the railway package .
In so doing I should like to thank him personally once more for his work as a rapporteur .
I particularly welcome the fact that the second phase of creating the European asylum system is underway .
The Greens would prefer alcohol to be taxed according to its alcohol content .
We have not come that far yet .
I , too , as a member of the Italian Social Movement , am on strike , and will therefore not be taking part in any of the votes .
When the conditions of access to the ferry survey database are elaborated in the committee , my services will give full attention to the need to feed as much information as possible from that database into the Equasis database .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - ( NL ) Madam President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , this is the first time we have held the annual debate in which we prepare for the spring summit in the afternoon .
It does not see raising small @-@ scale and family farming incomes as an essential prerequisite for the preservation of agriculture , the rural world and food safety ;
We are a country that fully involves employers and trade unions - a &apos; voluntary pillar &apos; - in all legislative decisions .
On the one hand , we may see prospects for development in the industry .
Regarding cooperation , in early 2009 , there was a big operation against counterfeiters together with the Italian authorities , so cooperation is working .
This is true for the Member States and may be even more so for those now seeking entry , whose administrations for decades have used the vast majority of their time mainly to prevent their citizens from moving .
Request for the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Pasqua and Mr Marchiani
The proposal is in line with Resolution 1452 ( 2002 ) of the UN Security Council , in accordance with which exemptions are permissible upon application by Member States of the European Union .
I would like to thank the colleagues from the PPE and from the Liberal Group for having supported this resolution .
If the President , and indeed colleagues , would limit themselves to one question , by my mathematics nine further speakers might have been called .
The things we should be doing are common things that individual Member States cannot manage , to build the EU into a common market , a real common market .
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate Mrs Boogerd @-@ Quaak on her excellent report , but I would also like to thank the Commission for its Report on the Demographic Situation in the European Union .
On this point , Mr Poettering , I agree with you for once .
Quite simply , we are coming up against this budgetary problem .
And one final word from Scandinavia : it is painful to see how we are cutting back our fleet in Denmark , while the other Member States are failing to do the same .
As he said in his own remarks , the evolution of a common foreign and security policy is shown to be even more timely by the appalling events of the autumn of 2001 .
A merger between Swissair and SABENA is still on the cards , but we rely there on an agreement with Switzerland which we will be discussing this week and on a forthcoming referendum in Switzerland .
How can you say we have not worried about Eastern European when , amongst other things , we have carried out an enlargement involving eight Eastern European countries , and within three years two more Eastern European countries will join .
That never gets mentioned these days .
Please excuse me , it is actually scheduled for Tuesday afternoon , at 15 : 00 .
She calls for a European tax to be introduced as a direct revenue .
There is no other way to combat the anticipated increase in road freight transport , which is forecast to reach over 60 % by 2013 in the EU alone .
At the same time , I think it is important to take up social issues , as Mr Barón Crespo and some others have suggested , and establish that we have made progress on these issues and the situation of the labour force .
The second point is that frankly it is difficult for me to understand why , if the Council thought it right to award itself 71 new posts , it refused very modest demands from the other institutions , for example the Committee of the Regions , which has undoubtedly seen significant increases in its own responsibilities since the Treaty of Amsterdam .
Likewise , to show respect for a minority opinion while ignoring the majority decision is offensive to both the given majority and the general principles of democracy we all claim to cherish .
They are full of bombast and hypocritical interest , without ever naming who produces , spreads and uses these weapons .
( Applause ) In view of this important change on the part of the British Government , will the Socialist Group agree to withdraw Amendment No 50 so that we can adopt paragraph 8 undiluted ?
We understand the argument that it is often difficult to make a clear distinction .
This is , in fact , a more realistic approach but the calculations are more difficult than they are with volume reduction .
That is the essence of this report , for which I venture to ask for your support .
Rules on telephone tapping are controlled , for example , at national level .
&apos;Several hundred cases &apos; remain to be investigated and prosecuted ; the fact that the Croatian judiciary is ignoring these cases ensures the continuing distrust of the Serbs .
So it is a very complex subject and one particularly difficult to grasp because we still have no universal indicators for putting a monetary value on environmental assets .
More importantly , European countries are suffering unacceptable pressure and they see their future as mortgaged by high interest rates on their debts .
Mr President , just a few moments after sitting down , I rise to speak again , this time in my capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy .
So our continent will have to rethink its rules rather than simply tidy them up .
I belong to a national movement in my own country , Scotland , which over the last 100 years has produced great constitutional change without a single drop of human blood being shed or a single act of violence occurring .
However , it must be seen in its entirety and not viewed selectively .
Additionally , in specific discussions on the Agency &apos;s budget in relation to fees and charges , the Commission undertook to take account of the specific situation of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises when reviewing the Regulation on fees and charges , especially the impact on their economic feasibility .
Generally speaking , society and the families of people suffering from mental illnesses suffer because , in many cases , women with psychological problems are dealt with as people who are over @-@ sensitive and not as sufferers needing special care and attention .
Parliament can opt for the latter by requiring the Commission to make a proposal for a framework directive laying down the principle of an adequate minimum income in Europe .
This is not , however , a question of principles .
The next item is the report ( A4 @-@ 0210 / 98 ) by Mrs Schroedter , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , on Agenda 2000 , Part 1 , Chapter II : Economic and Social Cohesion ( COM ( 97 ) 2000 - C4 @-@ 0523 / 97 ) .
It is very good that the new directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it ; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself .
Mr Wohlfart , you can , of course , arrange a meeting with Mrs Hulthén afterwards . As President , and also speaking as a doctor , however , I wish to say that the appearance of antibiotic @-@ resistant bacteria is an indisputable fact .
I would like to think that this Parliament is firmly on the side of the unreasonable man .
That was an interesting interjection from Mr Daul .
Mr President , this is not specifically about our agenda for this mini @-@ session but a matter that affects our work generally and therefore the June I partsession .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon .
What we are proposing are improvements to the Council &apos;s position .
I also hope that the Council will as yet move a little closer in the direction of Parliament to ensure that we in any event end up with a balanced approach .
In particular , we should be working towards establishing genuine freedom of movement and resolving the problems of demilitarising and disarming the island .
However , EFSA continues to permit its use in products intended for consumption , in flagrant breach of the precautionary principle .
The huge price increases in the financial markets for agricultural commodities have largely been caused by speculation .
&lt; empty &gt;
We have an opportunity after the recent events to rebuild and improve the transatlantic relationship - that has to be the challenge we take on board .
Finally , Mr President , honourable Members : the Arab League .
The Presidency can also assure the honourable Member that it will take every useful step to proceed to an attentive and detailed examination at the political and technical level of the whole of these complex and sensitive questions .
Russia has it in its power to comply with what we have said today .
I am also grateful to our Commission colleagues , who provided us with a great deal of information and were most understanding , although I very much regret - as did the entire committee - that one Commission colleague decided in the end that none of the amendments was acceptable .
The guiding principle here must be : &apos; same business , same risks , same rules &apos; .
She rightly says that it is true that the additional statistics may mean limited excess costs .
The European Union &apos;s trade strategy sees national bilateral and interregional trade relations as complementing the multilateral efforts made within the WTO .
But we at home in Europe have to rise to the momentousness of this period .
I believe that what the Rocard report is lacking , however , is a lucid analysis of the ills of European society , with regard not only to the need for reforms in the democratic Arab world but also to our policies .
Almost half of all Austrian banknotes currently in circulation are 20 @-@ and 50 @-@ schilling notes . On the other hand , the smallest EURO banknote ( 5 EURO ) is roughly equivalent in value to 70 schillings .
There are other very legitimate opinions in the Group of the United European Left . But I warn you that it has been difficult to reach a position .
The French Members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group reject the Haug and Ferber reports on the guidelines for the budgetary procedure . They reflect political choices our delegation finds unacceptable .
I can only confirm that this is a positive response to the challenge of Member States &apos; willingness to fight fraud , to put their house in order , to enhance control systems , a challenge that we have pointed out in the annual report may be even greater this year , while not for one minute diminishing the role and the responsibility of the Commission in this context .
It is in the common interests of European consumers and industry alike to promote the product development of new and safer chemicals .
Cuba
Mr President , I thought we were going to vote for this amendment when the time came , in the corresponding line . But if you are asking me for a voting recommendation now , I recommend that we vote on it straight away and in favour .
I particularly welcome progress on Article 4 of the framework directive so that the principle of appeals against NRA decisions on the substance of an issue , not just on whether procedure has been followed correctly , has been accepted .
The text as a whole , however , only hides the Member States &apos; responsibility in their incapability of dealing with the repercussions of the heatwave and the forest fires .
Thousands of people have been killed and been made homeless as a result of hurricanes , volcanic eruptions and earthquakes . It is these that are natural disasters !
The lack of an EU legislative framework is , nevertheless , a potential risk and could lead to serious problems in isolated cases .
That was not to be .
They are mainly linked to the fact that the European Parliament cannot and will not close its eyes to a whole series of issues related to the fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria supporting the protection of fundamental rights , media freedom and freedom of association , as well as the protection of minorities &apos; rights , good neighbourly relations , etc .
It was supported by my group because it would have allowed specific aid under the first pillar to compensate for natural handicaps and also to ensure that agricultural activity was maintained in mountainous areas , in environmentally sensitive areas and in Natura 2000 regions .
Too many cosy deals were done with other people &apos;s money and people were prepared to turn a blind eye to the weaknesses of those deals .
Decisions on redemptions of existing debt were to have been taken before the end of 1997 .
B5 @-@ 0633 / 2001 by Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten and others , on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group , on the human gene register BRCA1 and BRCA2 ( breast cancer ) ;
As less funding is now available , many of the actions previously planned will now not be undertaken .
I have never encountered the kind of pressure that the ACP has faced during these negotiations , especially as they are threatened with being severely disadvantaged by Europe &apos;s GSP tariff regime .
We have had a few altercations with the Council but have held sway in the end .
But the European Union is also a cultural area of immeasurable diversity .
I would like to remind you that without American support and involvement some problems on the European continent would be still hanging in the air .
I do not know whether there are Members in the House from Germany who would be prepared to enter into a wager with me about whether presumptive German taxpayers would be supporting Opel in this way if such an important election were not taking place in ten days &apos; time .
President Kim Dae Jung has strongly advocated greater international engagement as a way of handling the problem and I can certainly assure you that we fully support , as Mr Brinkhorst has urged us to do , President Kim &apos;s &apos; sunshine &apos; policy .
After long consultations with the Belgian Presidency and the European Commission , an agreement was reached overturning the initial arrangements and enhancing Parliament &apos;s role , so that it could become involved by right at the heart of the European debate .
Jonathan Evans highlights the example of major investments .
As a former mining engineer , energy policy has been one of my prime interests , so I am happy to be making my swan @-@ song on an energy subject .
For this reason , I do not wish to speculate at this time on other things that may or may not happen .
Secondly , there is the special treatment reserved for micro @-@ enterprises , which have always been considered essential in order to safeguard the principles of the Small Business Act .
Together with the ASEAN countries , China is hoping to create a free trade area by 2010 , and this would be the largest economic block in the world .
The resolution is asking us to develop a process of open coordination , and I would like to say that , in principle , the Commission is in favour of more coordination in tax matters .
I commend them for their worthwhile and committed efforts .
I would recommend that we now decide in that way , and democratically , how we want to cast our votes .
Secondly , Member States with a large population get more than their fair share .
Can the Commissioner state whether the cost of what is being proposed has been discussed in the Council and what , for example , the Belgians have said about it ?
It is the only region in Europe which has not been able to benefit from any flanking measure provided for under the new regulations for former Objective 1 regions .
Another point which is also just as important is that these liaison officers will be obliged to respect fundamental rights during their mission .
Madam President , I know it is not the your brief , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , but I have to say that your contribution today lacked a commitment to doing something about the serious situation in Zaire .
Parliament &apos;s calendar of part @-@ sessions - 2013 ( vote )
Completely replacing the rules on extradition within the European Union with the mechanism of the European search and arrest warrant will have an effect on the Schengen acquis and must also be reflected in the workings of the Schengen Convention .
In recent weeks it has once again been made clear that this partnership is of great importance in ensuring security and stability throughout the continent of Europe .
What Barcelona is mainly about , of course , is consolidating and developing the EU countries &apos; share of world economic domination .
To do this , however , we need reliable statistical data that are comparable and harmonised at European Union level .
Coordination of the national measures is one of the cornerstones of the common European approach proposed by the Commission .
It is doubtful that this impact can be adequately assessed by the national competition authorities .
This part concerns Community officials seconded to the agency , and other servants recruited by the executive agency .
In the few minutes I am allowed for this first speech , I shall not go into any more detail , but I would like to say that the elections that are going to take place in Ukraine , not in a year ’ s time , but in two months ’ time , will be absolutely fundamental to all of us , not just for the European Union , but also for Ukraine , undoubtedly , and for all of the countries of the eastern part of our continent , which will be affected by their results .
I have something to ask of you , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office . It is with great joy that we have heard that our colleague , the former Prime Minister of Luxembourg and one @-@ time President of the European Commission , Jacques Santer , has been appointed by the government of Luxembourg , that is , by Luxembourg &apos;s Prime Minister , Jean @-@ Claude Juncker , as Luxembourg &apos;s representative to the Convention .
Mr President , response to the sovereign aspects of the economic crisis was slow .
I voted in favour of the European Parliament legislative resolution on &apos; the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding &apos; , because I believe that improving women &apos;s rights in the workplace is a real step towards gender equality in an area in which , unfortunately , many barriers exist .
Joint acceptance of the new policy is a key objective and includes Russia &apos;s full participation in all northern dimension structures and activities .
Thank you , Commissioner and I certainly agree with the substance , particularly of the early part of your answer .
According to the framework directive on ambient air quality assessment and management and the respective individual directives , which define emission limits for PM10 particulates and for benzene , the Member States must ensure by appropriate measures that the limits are maintained nationally on the appointed date .
Mr President , the work programme for 2006 gives the European institutions a great opportunity .
The grant of an implementation permit for such projects is , however , subject to the environmental impact assessment procedure .
I would emphasise &apos; the full involvement of your Parliament.&apos;
So by your amendments , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , for which I thank you , you have consolidated and made explicit the legal base which the Commission proposed .
I said we cannot go on as if it is business as usual .
First I wish to reassure other victim parents , some of whom have expressed concern that this resolution deals with a particular case , that their tragedies too are just as important to me .
The family , the role of community groups and volunteers who can provide support services and the introduction of a respite care grant for dependent older persons must form part of this health strategy .
This is a task which will be accomplished through cooperation between the Commission and Member States .
Firstly , we do not know the proposals for all the sectors and so we do not have an overall picture . Secondly , once the principle of decoupling has been endorsed , the Commission is free to apply it as it wishes .
Incidentally , Hans , Dutch citizens benefit a lot from this .
Stipulating the Europe @-@ wide applicability of Articles 9 and 11 whilst allowing the Member States the option of not making them binding on their businesses , although not ideal , is the only compromise possible , to which the alternative would be not having a directive at all , and nobody wants that .
Secondly , the report calls for the Central Bank to take action in other areas for which we do not believe it has a mandate .
In the URBAN pilot projects , under Article 10 , there is provision for specific measures to promote equal opportunities through the strengthening of partnerships and involvement of the public .
Very appropriately my original report included the call not only for a common consolidated corporate tax base , which it does , of course , support , but also for EU @-@ wide minimum tax rates on corporate profits , which should no longer be exceeded by any country thereafter .
It is therefore proposed to prohibit entirely the use of oestradiol 17 ß and its esters in animal production for human consumption , putting an end to the various derogations that still exist today .
Had that have happened in Africa or in Latin America , we undoubtedly would have heard a different version of events .
Mr Hutchinson recalled that we had debated the situation in Zimbabwe , yet there was no resolution .
I also expect the Union at last to embrace the possibilities already open to it ; that the Member States will at last comply with their obligations and supply the necessary information to Europol in The Hague ; and that the counter @-@ terrorist Conventions will at last be brought into force .
. Mr President , among the aspects of European cooperation that was left unfinished is European integration and Monetary Union .
I am very pleased to say that we are making good progress in this work .
One of the core points our President addressed – and this is something I welcome – was terrorism .
Removal of bull @-@ bars from vehicles for which they are not necessary or not intended - non @-@ farm @-@ working vehicles , for example , - is another instance of how the EU can be consistent as regards pedestrian @-@ friendly enhancements .
I believe that the unfortunate events repeated here are unacceptable .
Hence , once all these conditions have been met , the full development of this single market will be possible , and also , by the year 2000 , the creation of new jobs arising from the 100 % implementation of the single market .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
That , of course , leads to work on reconstruction .
We must not be reactionary .
We have now , however , run up against another problem inasmuch as a dispute between the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and Danish journalists means that we are again unable to obtain any news .
I particularly welcome the fact that , in connection with the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the Ombudsman has strongly urged that the Charter recognise the citizen &apos;s right to an open , accountable and service @-@ minded administration .
Upon reflection , however , the view prevailed that the International Monetary Fund is , after all , financed to a significant degree by European money , so why should European countries not be able to draw upon its facilities ?
Secondly , the proposal on specified risk material was presented to the Council in December 1996 .
All attempts by the Council to treat such entrepreneurs more leniently than Parliament wanted at first reading would have unacceptable consequences .
That is also the Poland that , to my mind , should be the centre of attention .
In the interests of production planning for the next few years , it is important that the decision @-@ making on the extension of quotas be completed as quickly as possible .
I very much welcome the proposed new improvements , which will hopefully produce tangible results in the fight against fraud and tax evasion , especially the extension of the scope of the directive on all taxes , including social security contributions , the automatic exchange of information and improved cooperation between the Member States in matters of taxation .
Commissioner , I quote two important points which still raise questions and have not been given an adequate response , namely dual pricing and the cost of conversion .
The problems which have accumulated historically , especially in the Balkans , can only be overcome through European integration .
For the first time since the country gained independence , in 1960 , a democratically @-@ elected president could have hoped to succeed another .
And I shall do likewise , in the autumn , with the Objective 2 management authorities .
This preference has been challenged at the WTO , especially by the Latin American countries , which are large exporters of bananas .
It is worthwhile asking this question , since at a seminar held in France in 1999 , the European Union network for the implementation and enforcement of environmental law ( Impel ) discussed the causes of a massive ammonia leak at the &apos; Grande Paroisse &apos; factory , which is in the Seveso II category , and the finger of blame was pointed at design faults and equipment reliability .
We are seriously concerned about the deteriorating human rights situation in Iran .
We will be able to offer the still more than 14 million unemployed in the European Union real opportunities of taking part in this process of bringing about success .
We are also very committed to diversifying and looking at different sources of funding as befits our new entrepreneurial era .
Nor can we support the amendments which extend the proposal to the education , mass media and advertising sectors .
This is a time of unprecedented opportunity in the world .
Throughout Europe the main taxation resource is the indirect taxes which are particularly unfair since they are paid by both the poorest and millionaires at the same rate .
I am very grateful to the Commissioner for her introduction , but I also wish to express my gratitude to Mr Kyprianou for all the groundwork he has done at a difficult time .
I would like to thank Dr Adam for what I am sure was the very difficult task of preparing his report . In it , he says it is necessary to agree energy plans and strategies with the applicant countries , with the other Central and Eastern European countries and with the NIS , with the objective of closing down nuclear reactors ready for the scrap @-@ heap , ceasing work on unsafe reactors already under construction , and at the same time meeting the energy requirements of these countries , which are at present to a very large extent covered by nuclear energy .
The European Union has asked the Chinese Premier to appreciate their currency and put an end to unfair commercial practices which have , for years , fuelled tariff wars , highlighting this as a basic condition before addressing the issue of recognising China as a market economy .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
Parliament already has full rights as an institution to initiate cases before the Court .
It reflects the broad dissatisfaction amongst the populace with a desultory consultation process on the legal implementation of Article 23 .
But I appeal to this House to take a balanced and common @-@ sense approach on this issue .
They are , however , discussed only on rare occasions and in little detail by the European institutions , including Parliament .
The reason why European defence policy is not going well is because we are not clearly applying the method of variable geometry , which would enable the Member States that are determined to take action to define some common strategic interests and thus identify the resources to use .
I do not think that our positions on this issue are very far apart .
These organisations are particularly important for actively creating and developing modern technologies and ensuring economic development and modernisation , while , at the same time , creating new jobs .
I cannot , therefore , allow that to be said .
It is thus reasonable to ask oneself the following question : will there be any benefit to employment at all ?
First of all , Georgia &apos;s achievements .
As far as the Commission is concerned , I accept the criticism expressed by Mrs Plooij @-@ van Gorsel and finally by Mr Desama .
The debate is closed .
We are also unable to support paragraph 2 , which on similar lines calls for the creation of a common EU immigration and asylum policy .
Under the new Treaty of Amsterdam , however , the President of the Commission will have an entirely different role to the one he currently has .
The communication will make the protection and preservation of the environment an absolute priority , although this should not necessarily rule out the sustainable use of the Arctic &apos;s resources .
Maybe if we looked at how we distribute payments in these sorts of professions , we would achieve equality at that level as well as at the other end .
It is not acceptable that there are several thousand vets in a big country , and the same number , more or less , in another smaller country .
Indeed , that cloud contained over 100 pieces of European Union legislation vetoed by the British Government .
Mr Trakatellis and I assist you , Mr President , in that work .
Let us call them by their real name : we need to bring Mr Gaddafi to justice .
We have realised that we can take a big step forward here .
This is why I would ask Europe , where possible , to help out in order to guarantee the viability of airports , but especially the quality of life of those living near them .
While expressing the deepest understanding of the requests and pleas put forward by the forces of democracy in Albania , we are unfortunately in no doubt that the OECD mission , under Italian control , will not only fail to provide them with any satisfaction or support but will eventually cause damage - not irreparable , we trust -to the cause of democracy , the return to normality and the restoration of peace in Albanian society .
The Commission ’ s own code entered into force in November 2000 .
In those circumstances , the call for the immediate closure of the labour and detention camps , better known as the laogai , has a symbolic value also , as does the call to reopen the case of Wei Jingsheng , on the basis of an independent judicial review open to international observers , to put an end to the emblematic persecution of the most famous Chinese dissident who is being held in sanitary conditions that are a cause of concern .
The Irish government has stated its intention to hold a referendum on 31 May 2001 to ratify the International Criminal Court and to alter our constitution for that .
I assume that in the 2003 procedure we shall be able to find a euro or two to make additional resources available for these areas .
Such a percentage should not leave any doubt as to the legitimacy of his election , were it not for the accusations of irregularities made by the other candidates and the independent national election monitoring body .
The usefulness and value of the Treaty and the Pact depend on the certainty of the rules to which we all – Commission , Parliament , Council and Member States – must adhere .
In this area , a yellow card will probably be issued more frequently in future than we were used to in the past .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
The wonderful thing about most software packages is that there is practically no extra cost involved in adapting them for the disabled provided this is done at an early stage in the development process .
Parliament is committed to this task , which is something this report bears impressive witness to .
What we need is a mergers strategy that works , certainly , but one that also comes with a well @-@ regulated industrial policy strategy and with business strategies that respect objectives relating to the environment and social standards .
I ask the Commission and Member States to cease such deliveries via this ministry , to press the Government of Sudan to remove him from office and to immediately arrest and hand him over to the ICC .
I am of the opinion , which Mr Andrews expressed , that we should not forget how to be grateful .
Twice this request has been refused , contrary to the Rules of Procedure .
I am pleased that the work on a border solution between Croatia and Slovenia is on the agenda and that the Cyprus question is also being resolved .
We were astonished by the Council &apos; s intervention .
The EU should put its political will behind universal primary education by the year 2015 .
There is a need for better coordination of human and veterinarian research on resistance , as well as further research on new antibiotics , alternative treatments and animal disease prevention and control practices .
I must also admit that I do not fully understand the connection that some people wish to make between this aim of developing renewable energies and a liberal approach that often leads to a quest for the lowest cost in the short term , without worrying about the consequences in the medium and long term .
. Madam President , let me try to round up this important debate , to which I personally attach great importance .
Mr President , on 17 October , the Brussels European Council included in its conclusions a statement on Bolivia containing four points .
At a time when the maritime borders of my country , of Italy , Malta and Greece are demonstrating their great weakness , we would like the Frontex Agency to have at least the same capacity for deployment of vessels and resources for controlling and protecting our maritime borders as we are approving today for the Maritime Safety Agency .
Before the vote :
Secondly , I can pass on the news that the Commission has been working with , among others , those responsible for the finance markets on extremely technical matters of financial conventions and denominations , with a view to trying to lay down rules , at the request of the financial operators themselves , to ensure that the euro can be used on a harmonious basis .
Through the medium of Mrs Waddington &apos;s excellent report , I congratulate the European Commission on the presentation of the White Paper .
We worked extremely hard to try to get FYROM back on the rails .
In fact , it is in that context , in a global market , that the euro perhaps offers its greatest potential to Europe for the future and to the single market in particular .
I should also like to warn against judging just one side and apportioning blame solely to the Russian side .
We do have a policy on preparedness and prevention and again , as is the case with the legislation we discussed , the critical issue is for this policy to be turned into reality in our Member States .
This is not , however , an alternative to the DDA : it is an extension of a successfully concluded end to this round .
It appears to me that the ECB , in its drive to be as independent as possible , would like all the benefits of this statistical regime but without the responsibility that Eurostat are placed under by Community law .
It is an important issue , and one that we are highlighting here in the European Parliament through campaigning for the Convention to become legally binding and to be accompanied by an efficient supervisory system , in common with the other six UN conventions on human rights .
Our differences are on two points : firstly the eligibility of this specific proposal in terms of the current funding policies and criteria , and secondly the cost of the proposal both in investment and running costs .
I have proposed here in my report that the next document to be included in this portfolio should be a certificate of computer competence .
For that reason , Turkey must be given a credible prospect of accession .
I have just received a copy of one of the questions the Commissioner referred to .
( ES ) Mr Zapatero , I am absolutely delighted that you are here today and that you have placed such importance on the challenge of climate change and also on the need to act now .
There is no doubt that the European Union was exemplary in the way it chose to proceed with the regulatory and supervision measures .
The overall level of international public support required is estimated to lie in the range of EUR 22 billion to EUR 50 billion per year to 2020 .
The unworkable configuration of communities , ten cantons and a federal government was not its fault , but it is a nonsense .
The Commission is pleased with the constructive attitude taken by French authorities and in particular , I would like to stress , by Mr Francis Mer , the Minister for the Economy , Finance and Industry .
We face wide @-@ ranging reforms as part of Agenda 2000 , and we saw with the MacSharry plans that some countries handled the reforms neatly by devaluing their currencies .
We would therefore ask the Presidency to show greater firmness in these matters , and in particular in the fight against illegal immigration .
Not every government appears to realise this , as was evident last year .
We now move on to the catch @-@ the @-@ eye procedure .
I would , however , essentially take the view that culture must strictly be the responsibility of the European people and that even programmes favouring the so diverse European cultural heritage should preferably not be established at European level .
On the other side , it is fair to say , are a minority in this Parliament who think that the European Union should henceforth work more on an intergovernmental principle .
As a result , the government is reducing pensions and benefits , but the Commission tolerates this .
The more exceptions are provided for , the further the right to regulate is weakened and the more harm is done to the harmonisation and coordination of national organisations in this field .
With regard to the proposal for a directive on the elimination of controls on persons crossing the internal frontiers , the Commission was concerned , as I have already said , to make it clear that it did not intend to promote freedom to the detriment of security .
2 .
I would particularly like to thank Mr Bourlanges .
Obviously there are certain points on which we are not all agreed , myself included : for example , broadening the definitions .
An area which would benefit from cutting back is notification , at least the admission procedure for admitting certain individual claims .
There is a palpable sense of &apos; weariness &apos; with regard to expanding the European Union , but we cannot allow ourselves to keep countries like Moldova and Ukraine outside the European Union for a long time .
I would like to thank the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council for that excellent answer , but I have just a few things I would like to ask him about .
From now on , restrictions on rights in the Member States are subject to European law ; they are no longer national decisions .
The outcome cannot be described as something that has produced a simplification of legislation in Europe , quite the opposite , it has all become more bureaucratic , more complicated , harder to understand and more inefficient , the opposite of ‘ slim ’ , I would call the directive ‘ thick ’ , to borrow the English word .
Aircraft , helicopters , food and medicine must be available on demand and at a moment &apos; s notice .
Finally , I should like to mention the need to recognise vocational qualifications , thereby facilitating the increased mobility of professionals and students .
A substance as toxic as heparin , a rat poison , turns out to be an effective anticoagulant which has saved many lives .
It is a limited study which only covers five different Member States , but it is very interesting and I will supply you with a copy .
This is wasteful and conveys an image of an over @-@ bureaucratic Europe , acting in a totally disproportionate manner .
I would , however , have preferred the Ministers for Foreign Affairs to be present , as at the Europe @-@ Africa meeting in Rabat .
So we have four years left together to really make a difference for women and men .
6 .
The draft Statute provides for a common salary for all MEPs , but the proposal also stipulates that MEPs will pay European income tax from now on .
To conclude , the idea of imposing an EU organic logo on products from non @-@ EU countries , without the indispensable indication of the products &apos; regional and national origin , should most definitely be rejected .
Now more than ever , being an air traffic controller is an attractive career , and one that can take you all over Europe , and I hope that it will be one on which even more young people will decide than they have done in the past .
That point was raised yesterday , Mr Hallam .
This is why we will support the content of these three reports and congratulate the rapporteurs .
Finally , the European Parliament needs to be fully involved throughout the process in order to ensure the highest level of democratic legitimacy .
However , I would like to emphasise again to all of the Members , but in particular to Mr Simpson who has taken such a keen interest in this area and who has put so much work into it , that we are very serious about this particular issue .
The introduction of shorter working hours is a good idea for several reasons , but it is not an effective weapon in combating unemployment .
Mr President , whilst I admire the way my colleagues have pursued the interests of farmers and share their anxiety about the future of farming , I cannot agree with the approach they outline in the resolution .
Mr President , Belarus is a country which shares a border with the European Union but which seems to be 1 000 light years removed from it .
Europe is not addressing the relationship between illegal immigration and terrorism , and yet Al Qaeda members are identified daily in the ghettos of illegal immigration .
In the first of these amendments , we emphasise the importance of reducing the &apos; black &apos; or &apos; grey &apos; economy .
I welcome the adoption of this report , which strengthens the bases of the large European rail freight network which I have been calling for for several years .
It moved in a timely fashion to guarantee liquidity for the markets .
My question to Commissioner Frattini is whether the Commission intends to find out whether Dutch return policy is in line with the European minimum standards for asylum seekers as laid down by the directive that is required to be implemented by October of this year , and whether it is in line with international agreements .
Instead , it is the fault of some selfish , falsely moralistic national governments , as quick to jump on their soapboxes as they are unwilling , as in the case of Great Britain , to relinquish their claim to nearly 30 years of unfair privileges .
Of course , one or two things are up for criticism , and there is room for improvement in terms of the way in which it has been introduced , but I would also like to point out that those who have submitted this question are now shedding crocodile tears .
In France we can confirm flow difficulties in certain areas , such as the Loire district .
I will therefore now ask whether the Members are formally opposed to changing the order of business as I have just suggested .
History shows that the doubters &apos; arguments , both then and now , are almost the same .
Consequently , both for the purposes of external relations and in terms of working within the United Nations system , where the European Union is the greatest contributor , we need to increase our political influence and express our political strength together .
This argument , based on the risk of terrorist attacks , could lead us to get rid of the gas industry or stop drinking water , and I find that absurd .
By avoiding applying the policy to some sectors , Member States would not only be wasting an opportunity for technological change but would also run up a much higher reduction bill for the future .
Mr President , it is very late now and very few of us are left but nevertheless we are dealing with a very important issue .
– Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , a year ago , we celebrated the enrolment of the one millionth Erasmus student .
I do not think we should criticise Member States for having those fears : it is understandable .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this is proof that lobbies do work !
Furthermore , we demand that the Italian authorities respect their obligations in accordance with European Union law .
There need to be reviews not only of current visa practices but also of the many things that happen through diplomatic networks .
We are therefore concerned here with comparatively modest amounts .
So , it is actually taking Member States further than they initially wanted to go when they started off rather suspiciously with a Code of Conduct .
I therefore abstained for these two reasons .
Such an imbalance is an increasingly serious practical and moral obstacle for further progress .
They are signing a bundle of amendments they cannot even understand .
I share the environmental concerns of those tabling the motion for a resolution .
The rejected asylum seekers become stateless people , victims of the open season on migrants , which is no less disgraceful for being regulated .
I hope that the new President of the United States , as he said in his pre @-@ election speech in Berlin in July 2008 , will set a high value on these relations .
Why , when transporting our own troops in our own country , did we have to hire aircraft from the Ukraine ?
I share the rapporteur &apos;s opinion that multilingualism has a major impact on the daily lives of Europe &apos;s citizens , given the abundance of communications , growing mobility and migration , and increasing globalisation .
We are virtually at the end of a legislative period and we also have enlargement ahead of us .
Lastly , I am delighted that this agreement , together with the 2008 / 2009 review clause , paves the way for the crucial reform of the European Union ’ s finances , which is becoming a crucial and urgent stage in European integration .
By specially purchasing information and advertising its publications , the Observatory has become the main source of economic and legal information covering various segments of the audiovisual industry , which is used by members in both the public and private sectors .
In evaluating the dialogue with Iran , for example , the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 18 March 2003 underscored its concern at discrimination against religious minorities - particularly Baha &apos;is - and the need for more progress as regards freedom of opinion and expression .
. Mr President , first I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Grech , for his excellent proposal and the agreeable levels of cooperation we were able to achieve during discussion of the report .
In this connection , then , I would urge the Commission to provide us very quickly with its proposed reform of the COM in sugar .
This is the war of Mr Clinton &apos;s penis , designed to bolster his image in the face of allegations about his character back home .
Almost exactly a year ago , on 10 May 2002 , the ad hoc delegation from Parliament considered that the ban on the ADEP would constitute a substantial step backwards for Turkish democracy .
I believe that , with clearly defined indicators , the work can be carried out in the best possible way .
( FR ) The European Parliament , during its sitting of 13 April 2000 , quite rightly decided to delay the decision giving discharge to the European Commission on the implementation of the budget for the year 1998 .
Mr President , no law @-@ abiding citizen should be worried about his or her identity or their children &apos;s identity being substantiated .
The slogans put up at the most recent meeting , such as ‘ If the government will not pay the police , the mafia will be happy to ’ . go beyond all the accepted principles of independent trade union activity .
In this respect , I welcome the recent European Court of Justice decision clarifying certain rules in the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact .
We would therefore welcome your comments on this .
Of course , we understand the obligation of the State of Israel to defend its citizens .
However , the aim must not be to establish deregulation and privatization as the main principle of our technically imparted social and cultural communication processes , as Commissioner Bangemann still wants ( cf. the &apos; convergence &apos; debate ) .
In the United Kingdom , the influx of workers contributed to economic growth and an improvement in competitiveness .
It is no coincidence that , in the face of the impasses , the Chinese are trying to compromise .
We are firmly committed to the idea that the European Union , too , must do its homework and set in motion the necessary institutional reforms in order to complete the constitutional process , and I can do no other than repeat what Mr Schulz told Chancellor Merkel in his last speech in Brussels , namely that the Council and the Commission must do everything in their power to get this process completed contemporaneously with , and in parallel with , the negotiations with Croatia , so that Croatia will be enabled to become a Member State of the European Union rather than finding the door slammed in its face .
That too is a vast improvement .
I support the terms of the today &apos;s report which states that the European Council should vote for accession negotiations with Turkey to begin without delay and the objective of these negotiations is Turkey &apos;s EU membership .
Nine years ago , everyone thought serious action would be taken to improve the safety system ; yet this did not happen .
I have no alternative but to vote in favour of the report by Mr Sosa Wagner on the need to ensure ethical and secure governance of the Internet .
It has been said that it is important in the single market to have free movement of labour to provide services .
Against this background , we should welcome the fact that a series of agreements have been reached with other countries to promote this cooperation by means of workshops , meetings and seminars , for example .
This is sufficient reason for me to vote against the proposal .
I think it is also necessary to consider the integration of the trans @-@ European energy networks into the European corridors that have been proposed for the land transport sector .
I agree with the report , in that it is important to link up the various methods for treating the disease .
Their long @-@ term impact on sustainable development is undeniable .
Our messages to our citizens and to the Council are muddled and lack credibility .
As a supporting argument , I should like to mention a fundamental issue .
Allow me to comment on the Middle East .
Or to ensure higher education in the Hungarian language .
There have also been cuts to areas such as the social , environmental , agricultural , cooperation , research and culture .
He was a young 25 year @-@ old man who joined the new police service and was killed because of it .
Today , however , we are discussing the financial contributions made by the Community for the comparative tests .
We fear that the building of this dam will destroy tropical rainforest and trample over the rights of indigenous communities in the area .
In particular the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Specific Programme ( EIP ) serves mainly as a policy support programme .
I therefore anticipate that the Council will follow Parliament in agreeing to the outcome of conciliation .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
ALDE believes in a Europe of diversity , where everybody has the right to their own conscience , their own religion and even the freedom from religion .
It is also very important that all of us secure the right climate for enterprise , with less red tape and less bureaucracy , to encourage SMEs and risk @-@ takers to actually consider taking out risk capital in the first place .
Faced with this situation , I think the first thing to emphasize is the need for coordination in that region between all the authorities concerned , including those with responsibility for industry and mines - the precise cause of the catastrophe was the storage of waste water from mineral purification - as well as those directly responsible for the protection of the nature reserve .
Moreover , the victims - that is to say women and children - are often blamed .
European governments which thought that wars had ended once and for all and which often cut the financial resources available for defence and safety cannot , of course , talk loudly about terrorism .
At the same time inflation is forecast at 3.2 % .
This resolution is on 2009 competition policy and contains a global perspective of all state support of the transport sector within the EU , which is fundamental for the existence of a market without borders and for the free movement of people , goods and services .
Indeed , in drawing up its reports on the Next Generation Internet , the industry committee has given a clear indication of the vital importance of the future development of this networking infrastructure .
on behalf of the PSE group . - ( RO ) Madam President , Mr. Commissioner , dear colleagues . I would like to congratulate Mrs. Gurmai for her report and I am convinced that , due to her as well , the roadmap to be drafted by the Commission in the autumn of 2008 , for speeding up the introduction of incentives for intelligent cars , will be more ambitious .
Amendment No 5 : Amendment No 7 describes the objectives of the programme in greater detail without reference to the objectives of a policy on drugs .
You call this document – not necessarily very aptly – ‘ boosting trust through action ’ .
The car industry has applied the brakes , and the Commission is sitting back and watching .
I would like to make three points .
The reference to the negotiations on the EPA and the suspension of all trade negotiations to make way for it are the very illustration of this blackmail .
A year ago I also spoke to you about two issues that were fundamental at that time and which today are even more important .
. ( PT ) We have voted in favour of this report because as a result , the funding of EUR 27 million for the conversion of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets which operated in Moroccan waters will be ensured .
However , it says nothing about the redeployment of the United States Fourth Fleet in the region , the plan for the United States to use seven Colombian military bases , or the intervention operations that are undertaken from military bases in the territories of EU and NATO countries .
Firstly , the European Union must begin a dialogue with all of the parties , including Hamas , in order to promote a stable unity government .
The PHARE instruments , which are primarily designed to support institutional development , provide the framework conditions for promoting social dialogue in the appropriate manner .
We need to see fair and civil trials , if there are trials in Bahrain , and that the death penalty is avoided in all circumstances .
The first is the political one and the second is the technical one .
I voted in favour of Mrs Mathieu &apos;s proposal for a directive on the single application procedure for a residence and work permit for third @-@ country nationals .
The self @-@ delusion of some people who maintain that it is a case of good pro @-@ Westerners on the one side and supporters of the former regime on the other - that , too , is reprehensible , given that the roles of everyone , now and before , are known fact .
They are not good news for staff who refuse to acquire new skills .
The new food scandal demonstrates that the problem is political and that , before any legislative intervention , we need to get to the root of the matter .
If there are no longer any small @-@ scale fishermen , then all of the tourist and economic activity from sales by auction and specialist catering will also disappear .
.Mr President , the plan for strengthening the desired cooperation with the United States has been outlined in an extremely well @-@ balanced manner in the Brok and Mann reports .
The third point is that which gives legal certainty and which , when implemented , helps to ensure that identical decisions are taken in all Member States .
Transparency is a fundamental principle of the European Union .
I cannot speak for Greece or Portugal – their own Members will do that – but my own country certainly does not have an infrastructure in place to be able to meet the targets within the timetable that was required of other countries , although our Danish colleague has suggested that it is not ambitious enough .
I regard the introduction of free movement within the territory of the EU and the waiver of internal border controls as among the most important achievements of the European Union .
We do not believe that a ban on trading in seal products will improve animal welfare and we find it regrettable that the proposal was adopted despite having no basis in the Treaty .
Sustainable development is an all @-@ embracing EU rights principle which should have an influence on all spheres of EU policy , including the development cooperation policy .
If the German Presidency intends to make appropriate use of its dual presidency of the European Union and of the WEU , that is to be welcomed .
We value their help in formulating and applying policy .
There is an evident need to continue to step up dialogue and cooperation with autonomous women &apos; s organisations in civil society , politics and the institutions .
I should nevertheless like to point out that , on the one hand , OLAF must pay very careful attention to this report and that , on the other , Parliament and our rapporteur must pay due respect to OLAF .
Therefore , you see , I am quite happy for us to call for social harmonisation , but I would like to say to our French socialist friends that social harmonisation involves not advocating ideas in France that no one else is advocating in Europe , because that is an exception and our country is suffering as a result .
However , I would like to confirm once more that the Commission has no intention of proposing Community management systems .
Our efforts in promoting democracy and respect for human rights in Tunisia will be all the more effective if we are able to send consistent and coherent messages .
We accept the inclusion of catering waste in the scope of the regulation , but we must clarify that such waste is covered by the proposal only when destined to specific purposes in order to avoid duplication within environmental legislation .
The EU will only succeed in achieving its own climate protection goals if it changes its transport policy .
Finally , I suggest that we postpone the report by Mr von Wogau on consumer taxes , scheduled for this evening , to a later part @-@ session .
Closure of the sitting
in writing . - The southern Sudan referendum took place on 9 @-@ 15 January 2011 , with an overwhelming majority voting to establish an independent state of South Sudan .
Every now and again some self @-@ criticism does not hurt , and the same goes for the other institutions .
A current development is that the Christian south , where European standards have managed to take hold , and which has enjoyed a relatively high degree of individual freedoms , is being subjected to the strict life rules from the traditionally isolated orthodox Islamic north .
( Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163 ( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
Mr President , after listening to my colleagues from Campania who spoke before me , I think it is only right not to repeat the same observations and considerations , which occur naturally to anyone who , like them and like myself , has been to those places and comes from there , and has lived with those people through their drama of despair , profound grief , and great human dignity .
Sadly , however , these are also the vessels with the biggest outstanding debts to the banks .
Some of the problems caused by the market are diagnosed , and greater emphasis is given to environmental and social issues .
The insight shown by the chairmen has always made it easy for us to deal with representatives from the financial sector , those with an interest in policy affecting finance and also with associations , including consumer associations , trade associations , and so on .
What is needed is a single European centre which helps families , teachers , police forces and the courts to pass on the information needed to put an end to this atrocious crime and punish those responsible .
Mr President , firstly I would like to give my reaction to the rather naïve comments made by Mr Martinez about Kosovo .
Why am I making such serious allegations in the European Parliament ?
Finally , the specific situation of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises is also taken into consideration , with the result that the compromise before you today is a balanced yet ambitious package of measures .
And to avoid complaints from all who had declared their interest , twelve were chosen out of the 173 for which they had been invited to submit applications .
Enlargement had an historic and a moral dimension .
It is now a question of going further , beyond what emerges from the reports about what has happened . It is about freedom of expression for employees and about ensuring that future discussion of the EU deals with transparency in a broader perspective , for transparency must apply to all the institutions and involve more than making documents publicly available .
But it does provide pretexts for the politicians who in the meantime colour every debate on security in Europe with the subject of illegal immigration .
Since OLAF may well not be called in to deal with such cases , it would , of course , be necessary to invoke an administrative investigation or a disciplinary procedure .
It is a perfectly good idea to make the use of rapid diagnostic tests more widespread .
So , now some remarks in English about the financial perspectives .
Lastly , I should like to acknowledge the importance of integrating intervention mechanisms introduced by the Prüm Treaty - undeniably important mechanisms in the fight against terrorism and organised crime - into the EU &apos;s body of law .
You could survive on planting coffee .
We had asked the Council to reflect on the inadequacy of the Berlin spending levels for external actions , and we provided indisputable evidence in that regard .
This is important because , naturally , it will be a political dialogue there ; there will be a cooperation programme , and there will also be free trade negotiations .
But that study , to which many people contributed and which cost EUR 3.5 million , has remained a dead letter and failed to worry the authorities concerned , or at least to do so soon enough .
As we have heard from several of you , she has been working very closely with Parliament and has always looked for Parliament &apos;s involvement on different issues .
Is it worth the cost ?
Mr President , I wish to express my satisfaction at the fact that the European Parliament , through the auspices of my dear colleague and friend , Íñigo Méndez de Vigo , shares the opinion of the European Council in the sense that in order to bring about the proposed change to Protocol ( No 36 ) of the Treaty of Lisbon there is no need to call a Convention , given that we are dealing with a minor change , albeit one that is essential to enable the presence in this Chamber , before the next elections are held , of the number of MEPs that should have been here if the Treaty of Lisbon had been in force .
A concluding remark on Croatia .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , many goals have been reached but some battles have not yet even begun .
Now that European agriculture is cutting back so drastically , I cannot imagine how under the Brussels agreement , Bulgaria ’ s and Romania ’ s accession can also be funded with those 26 % .
I can be quite clear about this , Mr Nisticò .
We must find flexible solutions .
Even rare animals in nature reserves and zoos are now being sacrificed to the mad ban on vaccination .
Mr President , we have the awful situation where one EU Member State permits therapeutic cloning , which we have always been critical of .
Those judgments , in laymen &apos;s terms , are that , if you are facing undue delay for treatment , you have the right to go to another Member State , to have that treatment and have the bill sent back home , so long as the cost is comparable and so long as the treatment is normally available .
This report is primarily concerned with regional and European competitiveness and increased productivity .
Mr President , you told us that you take your responsibility seriously as the President of the Commission and we want to take our responsibility seriously as a parliament .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to use this minute and this debate to express gratitude and congratulations to the Board of the ECB and its President , Wim Duisenberg for their steady hand and for being an anchor of stability .
I would just like briefly to explain why .
Certainly , with these three points , it can be said that an instrument will shortly be in the hands of the European citizen that is simpler than expected , clearer than it appears at first sight and supposedly more effective .
As we know , the present energy market in the European Union is severely distorted .
Thank you , Mr Jarzembowski , and I wish you good fortune and happiness for the coming years and your future endeavours .
We are convinced certain resources are being overfished and overuse of driftnets is creating problems , not least environmental ones .
Of course , the Treaty of Lisbon , so frequently criticised , would bring the great benefit of enabling us to work together a bit more , for example , in the matter of energy policy and of the Common Foreign and Security Policy , to address effectively the dangers and risks of this world .
Everyone in this House knows that , of the 15 countries in the euro area , 6 have high public debts and financial deficits .
The forced resignation of the public prosecutor of Van for demonstrating the responsibility of army members for the Semdinli bombing was also very traumatic .
With all these measures , I will no longer be stuck for advice when constituents , facing legal problems abroad , call me asking for help .
We all remember the Herald of Free Enterprise , Scandinavian Star and Estonia disasters , to name but few of the more recent ones .
The main purpose of the Corbett report , even in the opinion of Mr Corbett himself , is to prevent Members who share a belief in the defence of national identity , sovereignty and independence being able to form a group .
In particular we want to consider the problems that the Treaty of Amsterdam presents and the fact that the full financial implications of the Treaty of Amsterdam are only being realised this year and we have to take account of that .
The report that has been submitted to you forms part of the supervision package which , as you know , had already been adopted unanimously in the Council .
Mr President , we see this as a particular additional proof that in the sphere of climate change the European Parliament supports the ambitious policy of the European Union at an international level with its actions , taking care that its political decisions are backed with the latest scientific results .
A number of States have already made preparations in order to be able to send the Members in question here quickly .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Mr Vice @-@ President of the Commission , even though the primary reason why SIS II is needed is that it enables the citizens of the new Member States to avail themselves of their right to unrestricted freedom of movement within the EU , my group will nevertheless be voting against the draft legislation , and there are two reasons why we have decided to do that .
At the same time , some people are saying that , under pressure from the Commission , there may be a further increase .
I will never forget the meeting that we , the chairmen of the parliamentary groups , had with you last December in Vienna .
This holds all the more true because , unfortunately , the Council is dragging its feet on the Greek Presidency ’ s proposal for a framework decision on the trafficking in organs , which we examined in this Chamber last October and , consequently , some information must be provided on this problem in general and more specifically on the tragedy unfolding in Mozambique .
As was the case with decisions previously made on natural disasters , and if the Commission makes a proposal to the Council regarding the earthquake , the Council will treat the matter as urgent .
Signature of acts adopted under codecision : see Minutes
Apart from this demand , which in our eyes is justified , Parliament has been extraordinarily cooperative , both towards the Council and the Commission .
I myself did not vote in favour due to the poor quality of the report &apos; s conclusions .
I have three further comments .
We should not however forget that multimedia communications are opening up new avenues for the reproduction of works within the plastic arts .
To successfully address the global challenges we need to rely without further hesitations on the fundamental values and principles of the European Community , which has been and still is the biggest success story of European history .
Mr President , the Commission &apos;s new @-@ found awareness of its responsibility for long @-@ term conservation of fish stocks is to be applauded and encouraged .
Security firms are already employing migrant workers without papers .
My dismay is that this was not resolved before the first meeting , because this group only meets every three months and the crucial agenda @-@ setting and design of two years ’ work will now have taken place without Members of this House sitting round the table .
The joint long , analytical and preparatory work has resulted , in my opinion , in increasing transparency and tighter management discipline .
Madam President , I would like you to check whether , under the Rules of Procedure , a quorum is necessary for this vote .
This is why we are now proposing regulation for liability .
Member States need to make the necessary efforts to implement provisions if they are to be effective .
I would like to make this extreme inconvenience known .
I think that what is crucial this year is not to stage a cosy , round @-@ table discussion , or some kind of chat show ; what we need to do when we reflect is to see what procedure and what method we should be using .
However , in the face of these challenges on an exceptional scale , the response has not materialised , and I regret that .
Obviously , if business travellers experience undue delays , that is a cost .
Fourthly there is proportionality .
I may even think it is worth us staying as a Member State .
These are operational points which cannot be dismissed .
. Mr President , I would like to thank the Commission for its willingness to withdraw the first proposal and to take account in its second one of what was said in the debate in this House , as a consequence of which we have met each other halfway .
On 1 May 2004 , seventy @-@ five million people from ten countries in Central and Eastern Europe , as well as the Mediterranean - namely Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Hungary , Slovenia , Malta and Cyprus - expressed their pleasure at becoming citizens of the European Union .
But they will also tell us that what we do , we must do better .
I consider myself fortunate to have been able to stay home with my children and my children fortunate to have had me .
Enabling the simplification of bureaucratic language and more widespread use of impact assessments would be very important , as would ensuring that as little time as possible is taken up with conducting complaints procedures .
In other words , it is not a question of one side imposing its will on the other , but neither is it a question of preventing the exercise of a constitutional right such as the right to call for the recall of a President .
That includes serious consideration of the call for genuine equality in the treatment of the accession candidates , including those which are not proposed as members of the first round . But it also includes more detailed attention to employment policy .
Please allow me to use my first words to congratulate you .
While former employees of the Dutch company NXP Semiconductors will receive EUR 3 534 per capita and the Danish former employees from Nordjylland will receive EUR 7 908 each , the Portuguese former employees of Qimonda will receive only EUR 2 867 per capita from the aid granted by the fund .
This is not , however , the time to turn our back on Nigeria - on the contrary ; Nigeria &apos;s stability and development matter not only to its own people , but also to Africa as a whole , and , if the Millennium Development Goals are not achieved in Nigeria , we are not going to be able to achieve them in Africa at all .
Just as many of my French @-@ speaking colleagues would not think of having lunch without a glass of red wine , our traditional Czech lunch without a half @-@ litre of high @-@ quality Czech beer would , for me , be unthinkable .
The solution advocated earlier by Mr Posselt , Mr Kasoulides , Mrs Cornelissen , Mr Chatzimarkakis , Mrs Göncz and Mrs Paliadeli is rooted both in negotiations under the aegis of the United Nations and in bilateral contact between the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Greece .

This means that the Member States must be able to commit jointly to an agreed way forward that also covers bilateral relations , and to speak with one voice in these contexts too .
Let us hope this is not all just an excuse to indulge in rhetoric . In the words of Javier de Luca , an expert who has done occasional work for the European Commission , let us hope this is not a case of doing something just to make it look as if we are doing something , about a question on which we would prefer to do nothing that really takes any effort .
Aside from the fact that it seems inappropriate to allocate funds on the basis of fish catches made by European boats without taking into account either fishery resources or the effects on the local population , the recent events make us fear that these funds will be used for military purposes against the Guinean population .
There are handicaps that are ongoing .
We would also like to have a date for when the first countries will be able to join us .
I believe that what happens at the so @-@ called environmental summits is not as decisive as what we bring to pass in our practical work between the summits and how we get it across to our citizens .
In this debate the focus is on the Council and Commission representatives .
The new international formation for the follow @-@ up period to Resolution 1244 will involve everybody and have a strong EU presence .

Nothing is better advertised than the quick replacement of a product .
We stand for freedom of access to our cultural heritage and daily intergenerational and neighbourly solidarity .
We think it is very important that it can be extended to the new Member States too , although the Commission has signed the agreement on behalf of only ten Member States .
I await the outcome of tomorrow ’ s vote with great interest .
I wish to highlight the clarification of the division of powers between the Member States and the Commission , underlining the need for Union activities always to comply with the subsidiarity principle .
Nobody else has a say .
And we cannot do that just by asking countries to coordinate their policies .
Could we cite the fact that command is being taken of the police , who have become a law unto themselves at local level , or the fact that the role of the army is under review ?
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( EL ) Madam President , it sounds rather ironic and tragic when those who made Zimbabwe a colony , those who plundered its natural resources all these years , are today fighting for its independence and freedom .
However , we are a little disappointed and I ask you to pass this on to Mrs Reding and Mr Barroso .
However , the position he adopts as rapporteur gives Member States a licence to impose very high charges , up to a few euros per kilometre , with the congestion charge and the mark @-@ up on top .
Sound management can also be undermined if cost @-@ cutting takes the easy way out and targets administration .
And if this is true , which it is , then we can welcome the decision of the Council and Commission , that Member States should assess the implementation of the Directives on employment and economic development in integrated Directives , evaluating the two issues in connection with one another .
When we are asked to define weapons of mass destruction , I suspect it is a question which could be put with some benefit to the Kurds in Iraq or to the people who live in the marshes in the south of Iraq , who could explain what chemical weapons do to your lungs .
Quite the opposite , in fact , for a great many social democratic aspects have been included .
Our fellow citizens need to understand the nature of our project and how our monitoring and decision @-@ making system functions , how it uses all the instruments available to us today , in particular the Broad Guidelines for Economic Policies , the Employment Strategy and the Internal Market Strategy .
We find it intolerable that a government described by some Heads of State as a flawless democracy does not allow us to organise a flawless democratic event there in Moscow .
This is both for administrative and legal reasons .
We have not begun to tackle the risks of this , so we need a very good explanation of what PNR data is being used for in the United States and what profiling techniques are being used .
I would therefore advocate that a ceiling of 25 years for the protection of registered design rights would be quite sufficient .

On the contrary , we truly believe that Mr Ferber was a tough negotiator .

The Charter has , rather , the status of a political declaration and not that of a judicial frame of reference .
Mr Berman has tried to find a good balance of measures , but the Committee on Agriculture unfortunately has a bias towards short @-@ term interests .
Morocco , Mauritania and Greenland are great negotiating challenges for the European Commission and we all hope that these negotiations will soon conclude successfully .

Now that two proposals for the Ports Directive have failed , this must be rethought .
My thoughts go to the victims of the explosion , to the men and women who died working at the AZF factory in Toulouse and who join the ranks of all those who die every day in a work @-@ related accident because their companies have given priority to profit over safety .
I would echo what Mrs Marinucci said concerning the scope of the programme under Article 129 .

Agreeing to the integration of the two directives would amount to allowing hazardous waste to be burnt in plants intended for household waste , and vice versa .
It is not , of course , a matter of doubt that Israel is entitled to defend itself against the Kassam missiles , for firing them at civilian facilities and persons is a crime .
The committee under your chairmanship is also a very fine one , with very fine members .
The new element , however - and the Commission is pursuing this possible solution - is Canada &apos;s apparent readiness to contemplate an interpretative statement making clear that Bill C @-@ 27 relates only to the application of the United Nations agreement .
My group , the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , has always backed the Galileo Project and we are now also backing the result that has been established .
We cannot hope to succeed in making these changes unless the Association Agreement allows the Algerian economy , which is already stretched as a result of the reforms that have been carried out over the past decade , to acquire the means to become integrated , gradually and harmoniously , into the world economy , and to acquire the added value which will give it full credibility , particularly from the point of view of increasing the flow of European investment .
All this requires a true foreign and common security policy .

In all probability , Kosovo will declare its independence within two months , and it is still difficult to assess the consequences of this beyond the Western Balkan region .
In her argumentation , the rapporteur completely forgets the basic principle of Community legal intervention ( whether from above or from below ) : the principle of subsidiarity .

One last word , Mr President : this weekend , in front of your European guests - the President of Parliament , the President of the Commission and in front of 2 000 French right @-@ wing business executives - you concluded your speech with words which were interpreted by the trade union movement in its entirety as an incitement - and a very unwise one - by stating that now , when there is a strike , the French people no longer even notice .

The Commission is now as good as in place , but it has had an easy start compared with what is to come .

What you have done here today is damaging to people at grass @-@ roots level and to the political system and to democracy .
It is the people living in Belarus - the students , men and women , society .
We voted for the Committee &apos;s Amendments 4 and 6 - two amendments which entail the removal of two , in our opinion questionable , exemptions for bluefin tuna fishing .
However , like other technologies , the practical results of GNSS applications are inseparable from the economic and social context in which they occur , and from the ends and objectives they serve .
We cannot allow any remaining doubts on this matter .
Mr President , I would like to thank Commissioner Špidla for the fact that we have a social package at all because , as I have said many times before , his task in the Barroso Commission cannot be easy .
In the meantime we await developments on those three factors .
There are essential decisions to be taken that are most fundamental to a whole society , and these decisions must be taken at the lowest possible level , as close as possible to citizens , and not in the ivory towers of Brussels , Luxembourg or Strasbourg .

Europe urgently needs a Constitution and it is within our reach .
When I listen to the Chairman of the Socialist Group , I think I am on another planet .
The bad news is that the President and the regime still enjoy some support among a significant proportion of the population .

Recently too , the Commission on Population and Development of the United Nations Economic and Social Council , ECOSOC , has also come to the conclusion , looking back at Cairo , that population and reproductive health are highly important issues that must therefore form part of development programmes and strategies to combat poverty , and that this would be the only way to achieve the Millennium Development Goals .
In order to be able to better assess the competitiveness of the car industry the Commission has launched a study that we will publish in a few weeks time in the context of our annual competitiveness report .

He makes it clear that European citizenship not only supplements and complements national citizenship but also that the concept should adapt to include the rights of long @-@ term resident foreign nationals .
This is all the more true when we talk about a primarily cultural - and therefore also political and institutional - effort , since in this case the talks must take place first with individuals , rather than with the Arab League or with individual States , not least because I believe that two of the major problems in the Arab world - nationalism and fundamentalism - now concern our European cities , too , which , from a demographic point of view , are also increasingly becoming cities of the Arab world .
The international consequences of a single currency therefore deserve all our attention .
But let me begin by briefly explaining why this is anything but a routine matter in the case of Germany .

( DA ) Madam President , we are here again today with something that has been pushed through by people who have not been elected , namely , the European Court of Justice , which , by means of a series of rulings , has put pressure on the genuinely elected institutions to also draw up this directive that has been voted through today .

I am not sure whether they understood that this would mean the European Ombudsman carrying out tasks currently belonging to the European Commission as the guardian of the Treaty , and to the European Parliament as the democratic forum to which citizens may address petitions .
The various problems raised , studied and dealt with in the Commission &apos;s Green Paper , along with the worthy contribution of the Committee on Development and Cooperation - here I would like to pay tribute to our rapporteur - have led to the drafting of this motion for a resolution , in which Parliament &apos;s desire to see the birth of a Lomé V , whose main objective would be the plugging of gaps in our cooperation , is clearly highlighted .

The people are asking us to do this , and it is our political responsibility to respond .

The proposal made under point 29 of a European year for the islands - with the possibility of a Forum on the islands , in Brussels , for example - seems rather unwarranted .

Mr President , every year , around this time , we live through a period of unprecedented extravagance in the European Union .

The Commission has tabled urgent measures which have actually already been requested in the approved regulations .
I would like to stress that this is the very means by which we will be able to establish the best possible conditions for our consumers , and take an important step closer to attaining the objectives of the European Union .

All our safety measures in the Union have been well received among the European public . Standards and rules are quickly taken up , whether they relate to motor vehicles , boats , trains or aeroplanes .
Mr President , on behalf of the Socialist Group and the Committee on Budgets , I rise to speak on Mr Tillich &apos;s report .

Mr President , first of all I should like to welcome the Commissioner , while at the same time , without wishing to give offence to her , regretting the fact that Mr Monti or Mr Bolkestein is not facing me across the Chamber , because they are of course the ones most directly concerned with this question .
I would be prepared to agree with this if the ELISE programme were the only one of its type , but it is not .
( DE ) Mr President , adopting the resolution banning thrombin in foodstuffs today simply means giving in to public opinion .
Furthermore , the Council &apos;s proposals on &apos; black @-@ list &apos; flags are still too timid .
This violation of individual freedom and personal dignity cannot be justified in the name of any culture or country .
We must , therefore , take advantage of the wealth of our past , our heritage , our roots and our traditions , even the very oldest , in order to prepare for the future . This cultural diversity and wealth will allow us to gain a better understanding of ourselves .
I am concerned that it could be used by some of the scientists and others as an opportunity to curb TACs and quotas when there is disagreement between fishermen and the scientists .
In the future , measures aimed at favouring the integration of ACP countries into the global economy must be taken concerning , notably , the setting up of true regional economic areas , the diversification of crops and produce and the modification of the rules of international trade .
At a time when reunified Europe is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin wall , EU @-@ Russia relations take on particular importance and deserve careful consideration .
I want to make one more common on this .
Why have we dispensed with negotiating a specific interregional market between the outermost regions of the European Union and Cariforum ?
We consider the recent third visit of the Dalai Lama special envoys to China to be an encouraging sign of progress .
I shall not comment on the case in question , since it is sub judice and it is not customary for the Commission to comment on such cases , but I would like to give you a clear explanation of the Commission &apos; s policy on the issue of transmissible diseases affecting developing countries .
However , we must not leave Croatia out on its own .
I believe that an amicable resolution to this dispute is in the interests of both the European Union and the United States and can be reached .
These provide information to parents about the dangers children could encounter on line - including online gambling .
Sometimes , especially recently , and here I must confess that I am as guilty as anyone , the leading role of MEPs and their political debates , even at national or local level , is too influential in procedures where national remedies have not run their course , and may give citizens false hopes that the European Union can resolve everything ; therefore there is a need to set an example that the principle of subsidiarity is crucial to ensure that all bodies , whether at State , local , regional or even European level face up to all their responsibilities .
A great advantage of EU enlargement in the long run is the inclusion of a country such as , for example , Ukraine , whose aspirations to join the EU the Commission is , sadly , ignoring .
The weapons of those who pedal fear is the big lie , eloquently demonstrated here today by Ms McDonald and Ms Sinnott .
We know that .
I feel that you should be very careful and tactful with how you make your announcements on this .
I did not , therefore , want my name to appear on it .
Secondly , would you not accept that the circumstances faced by Fukushima were quite extraordinary and unprecedented , both in terms of the strength of the earthquake - the strongest ever experienced in Japan - and the height of the tsunami , which reached a maximum , I am told , of 46 metres , and had an average height of 14 metres , conditions that we might not expect in Europe ?
We must treat it as a fact that the key to and , at the same time , the only effective tool for the European Union &apos;s economic recovery is research and innovation .
Secondly , as it is mostly a question of state aid , my services must also be notified of this type of matter .
Thirdly , the social dimension of the Lisbon programme is a very skinny beast .
So I think it is very important to make sure that it is high on the agenda at that conference , so we can make anti @-@ trafficking a reality .
It is for this reason that we are not now fazed by this new challenge .
If we create a new instrument after all , why do we not set aside some new money at the same time ?
I would also like to thank Mr Daul and Mr Schulz for calling attention to the fact that there are also floods , today , in other parts of Europe .
This is where we run up against contradictions , however .
Rulers like Franco , Mussolini and Salazar tortured their victims on the example set by Hitler and Stalin .
He should be pleased about that , as I and many others are .
Member States have therefore granted sizeable sums in the form of guarantee schemes , recapitalisation schemes and other forms of financing banking institutions &apos; liquidity , with the aim of providing them with a source of funding and a guarantee against risks .
Belgium is also the country of common sense .
In my opinion products for sale in EU countries but originating from outside the EU should also require this approval , otherwise the directive would damage and distort competition from the point of view of health protection .
According to reports in the Lithuanian media ( Verslo savaitė ) , in Lithuania the number of consumers shopping online has grown by 73 % over the last two years .
We support the expansion of the Petersberg tasks , and this must also include the fight against terrorism .
Firstly , I welcome this process .
She is very committed to her work there , and unfortunately the true message about this commitment is not being properly reflected in the contribution being made here today .
If we take the case of the labour market , positive mobility is essential , yet at the same time the Member States are taking decisions designed to prevent workers from the new Member States from exercising freedom of movement within the European labour market .
If the motion for a resolution were to be adopted in its present form , this category of ports would be excluded completely , which would certainly have detrimental economic and social consequences .
Member of the Commission . - I thank Ms Kratsa @-@ Tsagaropoulou for her question because it gives us the opportunity to refer to this very difficult situation in the Mediterranean .
Recognition of this European citizenship has been a slow process , however , which faces too many obstacles , even today .
It is also important that financial support for CHP should not be restricted to electric power plants generating less than 50 megawatts .
I would like to ask you , Commissioner , whether you personally and the Commission as a whole support states taking a path which goes against the common objectives in this first introductory stage of fulfilling the Europe 2020 Strategy ?
I too can see that this danger exists , but sometimes it is necessary , not least when more countries join in cooperation , to respect the fact that there may be different speeds within that cooperation .
We are interested in delivery .
In the midst of all this , what is being done ?
I would like to ask you whether you intend to create a European framework to increase SMEs &apos; participation in accessing European funds for developing tourism .
We will take a vote on the sections as you indicate .
I should also like to thank Mr Garriga .
I consider the practice to be discriminatory against these women and girls .
Both North and South Sudan must be governed on the basis of the principles of democracy and the rule of law , with respect for human , social and economic rights .
I am sorry that Edward McMillan @-@ Scott is not in the Hemicycle this morning because he has been dealing with this matter for over 15 years .
There are no conclusive indications or evidence of the toxic effects of amalgams if used appropriately .
I think water policy is one of the successes of European environment policy .
That does not always mean that he who is negative is always right .
In order to achieve these goals , it is essential that partner governments in Africa and third countries draw up resource management and land use plans .
I intend to contribute to the coordination of Member States &apos; deliberations desired by the Presidency by sending ministers information , particularly on the Unesco process , in order to stimulate the debate between the European nations on this matter .
Phase three begins once both sides introduce the possibility for investors to set up and control new airlines in each others &apos; markets .
I am sorry that Honourable Members declined to face up to their responsibilities .
– Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , it was in a difficult situation that Ireland took up the Presidency .
COCOBU held hearings for each of the candidates and delivered a favourable opinion on the appointment of eight candidates and a negative opinion in the case of two .
The Danube is a nature reserve and must be protected to preserve its biodiversity , but it is also a protected area for leisure and tourism .
It is clear to everyone that in order to achieve the objectives of the common transport policy high quality public transport which provides a real alternative to dependence on private cars is absolutely vital , and it is equally obvious that improvements in the efficiency of public transport and the transparency of public transport finances are therefore in the economic , social and environmental interests of the Community as a whole .
The fact that the leader of the European Commission happens to be a compatriot of mine makes me proud to vote this way .
Mrs Lalumière rightly focuses on how the Union can produce as effective an external policy on human rights as possible .
Let me conclude with two basic considerations .
Tuesday :
. Thank you for your suggestion .
– I support the purpose of the Single European Sky , which is to improve traffic flow and air traffic management alongside air safety .
My dream is that , in the not too distant future , goods crossing the Pyrenees from Spain into France via a central tunnel will then travel along the Canal de Midi and the network of French canals and finally to the Rhine , whose ideal and wise regulation we are today turning into European law .
The possibility of being able freely to determine premiums undoubtedly constitutes good news for good drivers .
Nothing has been said about the situation of architecture .
Boycotts , hunger strikes , demonstrations , they are normal methods of doing business in Albanian politics .
The proposal before us as outlined in the introduction is a very important one .
We have no authority to decide , which shows the small extent of our power , and the contrasting large extent of the European Central Bank &apos;s .
Mr President , we are lacking an important piece of information .
The approach to adopt will depend on the outcome of the investigation , which we hope will be completed with complete frankness .
In Chapter I , the Court reiterates the call it made in the previous year for a supplementary and amending Budget to be presented in good time .
Of course we would like to see a statute in place but not if that meant sacrificing its very essence : equal treatment for all Members of the European Parliament .
First of all , it is important that in case of doubt , the law is interpreted in the German language version since this was generally the working language of the European Parliament as well as being used exclusively by the Council and Commission for orientation purposes in the many trilogues .
You have expressed your agreement , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office .
Not least , he went to Chernobyl in person , in order to see for himself both the progress made and the condition of the sarcophagus in situ .
You said , Commissioner , that we have to give them some sort of clear signal , but what exactly ?
The mobility of European citizens within the Union , the freedom to travel , is one of the key European freedoms , and any restriction would undermine one of the most tangible benefits our citizens have obtained from closer European integration .
Question No 18 by Susan Waddington ( H @-@ 0585 / 96 )
However , as the quality of the enlargement process is and will continue to be very important , my group abstained during the final vote .
Entry into the euro zone by the other new EU Member States seems to be just a matter of time . The experiences of Slovakia in this regard will no doubt be closely observed by countries in the region that are also thinking about joining the single currency .
I would like to make some political and some professional comments .
Mr Bangemann has asked to speak .
This has now already begun : the forecasts for the current year and the analysis of the status quo are basically optimistic , although they do of course contain a number of risk factors , which I shall come to in a moment .
Participation of Bulgaria and Romania in the EEC @-@ San Marino Agreement on Cooperation and Customs Union ( vote )
However , it can help to resolve crises .
Parliament has adopted the Toy Safety Directive .
Fundamental rights and freedoms are not infrequently called in question .
The history of what has become the European Union is concrete proof that dialogue and cooperation and the rule of law can yield a coherent and sustainable mix of respect for fundamental freedoms , political stability and economic prosperity .
The Commission was the main driving force in adopting the Eurocodes on safe buildings .
The European Union supports the Roma &apos;s integration into society through different funding programmes such as the European Social Fund , the European Regional Development Fund , as well as the Progress and &apos; Youth in Action &apos; programmes .
I have no idea .
With the adoption of today &apos;s resolution , the European Parliament has once again called for protection for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
This austerity plan should improve GDP by 10 % over the next four years .
Where Iran is concerned , we are stuck in a cul @-@ de @-@ sac , and we have helped ourselves get into it .
We wonder when we read that it is these countries , which do not exactly set an example where human rights are concerned , that are calling for Israel and Hamas to carry out in @-@ depth investigations into the human rights violations committed during &apos; Operation Cast Lead &apos; .
The EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007 are having far @-@ reaching effects .
. I voted for the Estrela report on the environmental aspects of natural disasters , but against the creation of a special agency on drought and floods .
The most logical solution today is to reorganize the CMO with a view to maintaining employment and incomes , and even modulating the premiums , while always arguing on the basis of quality .
This will not only allow us to hold a debate on human rights outside the European Union , as is customary in this House , but it will also allow us to hold a yearly debate on fundamental rights and how they are applied by the different governments inside the European Union , as well as to see whether the European institutions are doing their jobs as they should be .
We will be doing that in our group meeting before the vote , as there are differing views among us on the subject .
Just as an example , the report highlights the following objectives : extension of the &apos; European Security Strategy &apos; ; military dimension of &apos; civil missions &apos; ; militarisation of &apos; development aid &apos; and &apos; development &apos; as an instrument of interference ; reinforcement of means of military transport ( A400M military aircraft and helicopters ) ; increase in expenditure on &apos; defence &apos; and military actions , including using the Community budget ; operational capability to conduct EU military actions , and coordination of projects and the armaments industry .
Mr President , we accept this agreement not because it is good , nor because it is the least worst option , but because it is the only option , given that 90 % of the European budget is now financed by the national budgets .
There is today no country in the Union that reaches the reproductive levels necessary to avoid extinction .
The 2002 reform , therefore , must not serve just for us to carry on staring at our own navel in the form of our own Community waters , our own problems and our own misfortunes .
I very much hope that this study will be completed .
I can very easily understand , therefore , your desire to reintroduce many of the amendments which were there at the first reading .
( Parliament approved the Order of Business thus amended )
The opposition , and not just the Kurdish opposition , is blocked , people are imprisoned on the flimsiest of pretexts .
Under the framework of EU values and principles , it is crucial that its CSDP be guided by a transparent and democratic process .
Sustainable fisheries depend upon decisions being taken at a local level and involving those to whom they are addressed .
We can also reformulate and focus the actions for the giving out of information mentioned in article 2 , paragraph 1c , so that they reflect Amendments Nos 17 and 18 .
Mr President , I have a small oral amendment .
We have , for instance , made it clear that we do not wish to take additional commitments on health , education and audiovisual services .
Our group supports the joint resolution .
Let us be clear .
Our rapporteur , Mrs Gräßle , has put a lot of work into guaranteeing independence , transparency and strict observation of the rules .
It must be capable of evolving in step with society because educational systems suffer when they are not rooted in life .
The ultimate objective of the climate agreement is to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius , an objective that was endorsed at the last G8 summit and the Major Economies Forum .
We believe it would be completely premature for the Copenhagen Council to set a date for the commencement of accession negotiations with Turkey .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report I am presenting to you arises from Council Regulation 1969 / 88 , which established a facility providing medium @-@ term financial assistance for Member States &apos; balances of payments .
The people of Ostend will welcome approval of this section .
Admittedly , it was adopted with some difficulty , but agreement was reached about money , which seems to be the most difficult issue and is therefore a test of the usefulness of the existing institutional rules .
in writing . - I support this report which calls for countries which have not done so to enforce a 2002 directive which seeks to strengthen the process of informing and consulting employees within the EU .
However , there are certain gaps in the review . I have attempted to fill these with my amendments to the report .
We must therefore strive to create a kind of global public spirit .
Such a policy must involve monitoring and acting to avoid non @-@ investment such as that which left several companies like General Motors and Opel in impossible situations whereby the workers bear the brunt of the consequences .
Back then to the subject of our debate : Mrs Jeggle &apos;s most excellent reports .
However , there is still more work to be done , with more Community method and less intergovernmental method .
I want to pay tribute to the overwhelming majority of the members of the committee for their attendance , diligence and discipline , which were necessary in order to get a report with a degree of consensus contained in it that will be imperative for that report to command respect from the Commission , the Member States , the Council and those engaged in the transit trade .
I would like to say to him or her : &apos; Go all over the world .
But a gaping democratic hole remains in place around agriculture and foreign trade. in Amsterdam foreign policy is &apos; Brussels @-@ ized a little more , but it has certainly become no more democratic .
At the same time there is also an increased desire for a better quality of life , which means that people are less willing to tolerate additional noise pollution .
It is in this sense that the fight against terrorism must be seen as part of a series of structural operations .
It is obvious that this is a completely unacceptable situation .
But they claim that this is not a vote against Europe .
The debate is closed .
I am very happy indeed that Mr Schnellhardt has said , on behalf of my group , that we will be supporting Mr Pimenta &apos;s report .
We will pass it on to the Council .
I wish you a happy and fruitful stay in Brussels .
As the elected representatives of EU citizens , we have a special responsibility to create the conditions for this kind of trust .
By their action , the Council and the Commission are preventing new technology from being produced .
It is my conviction that every Member State has a duty to do all it can to save human lives at sea , but it is also necessary for the other Member States to realise that we cannot leave Malta , for example , to bear the whole burden of receiving all the immigrants saved in the middle of the Mediterranean by Maltese vessels .
Unfortunately , more often than not , the jobs are poorly paid and insecure .
Decisions which relate to urban policy , to development policy , to forms of production , to a series of policies on territorial balance and other things , where transport simply offers facilities at a certain moment , resolves problems and makes its contribution .
I can offer briefly one or two additional thoughts which I hope will provide some context for the rest of this debate and which , I am sure , Mr President , you were entirely right to call with the agreement of the presidents of the groups .
The vote will take place today at 12 noon .
In this context , the proposed measures aimed at the safe , effective and environmentally @-@ friendly decommissioning of such plants should be included .
Human beings appear to be less valuable than animals , and every year sees an enormous increase in the number of women and children who are trafficked ; in the absence of solid statistics and figures , estimates range between 800 000 and 3 @-@ 4 million women and children every year .
These measures target the fight and resistance of the peoples , their vanguard , the communist movement , and the radical powers which refuse to bow down to the barbarism of the exploitative capital system .
Therefore , at a time when changes to the appendices of the CITES are being discussed , I recognise the importance of also ensuring that there is sufficient protection for endangered wild species without jeopardising or consigning to oblivion any activities that ensure the economic and social viability of many communities .
We must not cast all responsibility on to the weakest sector in Europe , namely the traditional European agricultural sector , which has the lowest income in the Community . It is not for this sector to provide solutions to the problem of world hunger .
As a result , the world closed its eyes for a long time – in fact , for too long – to the seriousness of the epidemic and did too little in terms of developing effective programmes of prevention , including contraceptive advice , of developing health care for the sick and of supporting research into more effective medicines and an effective vaccine .
I will use the normal internal procedures to reply to that question , but perhaps I can make some comment at this time .
Without the cover of a multilateral organization , or an international institution such as the United Nations , which in exceptional circumstances may issue resolutions which have an impact on trade , these unilateral measures are unacceptable , as are the arguments which have been used in an attempt to convince us , after the event , of the worthiness of the objectives .
Mr President , I should like to address a theme raised by the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council which nobody else has yet spoken about but which , for more than one person in this House , is of great moment and significance .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the situation of Guinea @-@ Bissau is nothing more than a specific part of a larger picture in a region of Africa that , like other regions , is continually destabilized politically to the point that there is little real political authority or concrete guarantees for the population .
In Spain we have sports newspapers , which only cover sports , and they are some of the most widely read newspapers in our country - even more than the national newspapers - and they hardly dedicate 4 % of their content to women &apos;s sport , and what is more , the content relating to women &apos;s sport often consists of news of a sentimental nature or on the postures or clothing of our sportswomen .
It is being held towards the end of the summer tourist season , of which we all have our personal experiences , and it is being held for the first time after the recent accession of ten new Member States to the European Union , which they enhance with their exceptional tourist destinations .
I believe that the dynamics of administrative development mean that this is the only way forward that is in your interests and ours .
They are just as important for biodiversity and the pollination benefits that we have heard of - very correctly - about the honey bee sector .
I believe that the local development initiatives must be of overriding importance .
The high level pan @-@ European consortium ...
While it is true that there is no way the measures proposed by the Commission can be a pretext for new job losses and increased exploitation in European industry , at the same time , we cannot ignore the objective difficulties that they will create .
These semantics would not go down very well , I fear , with the thousands upon thousands of grieving motherless children in the developing world , or with those children whose mothers have died in agony because there was no anaesthetic , or with a mother bleeding to death because there is no thread for stitches , or a mother dying because there is not the three cents to buy the magnesium sulphate that would save her from death through haemorrhaging .
Does terrorism acquire any kind of legitimacy if preceded by a long period of injustice - whether ethnic or economic or otherwise motivated ?
Portugal is exhausted and unable to deal with further tax burdens , given that in the end , this tax would be borne by the citizens , as the financial institutions would pass it on to their customers .
Its implementation will get us where we need to go .
Nevertheless , the reference in the Summit conclusions to the specific situation of Portuguese farming was made in such vague terms that it provides no guarantees at all .
I hope not to repeat them .
That too is progress .
Mr Rohde mentioned the example of China .
First , the demographic challenge .
The inspection of industrial fishing units is also mired in controversy .
The report adopted by the Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism is nothing but a paean to the nuclear industry .
What I would like to say , Mr President , is that we have done this because we are convinced that everybody has the unalienable right to the respect for life and this right cannot go unrecognised or be violated .
Secondly , and most importantly , because it does not appreciate the cultural dimension of this subject .
Upon entry into force , the new regulation will enable an entitled person to obtain a binding enforcement order anywhere in the European Union .
Let there be no misunderstanding about that .
In addition , the outcome of the negotiations should be what I would refer to as ‘ developing @-@ country @-@ friendly ’ .
There is no doubt about the usefulness of the programme and the monitoring networks , and to strengthen them would mean a huge increase in the service which the forests offer to European society as a whole .
The subsidies are unfair trade , involve unfair dumping and the use of unfair competition against profitable plants .
The combination of the regulation and the increased , although still far from adequate , budget should now result in a proper programme , by which I mean one with a legal basis .
I must also emphasise that the agreement could have major implications for relations with the other Pacific States , including Australia and New Zealand .
Lending new dynamism to economic growth in Europe is a task for the Member States and the Union , a task that will help to shape the next few years .
I told him , &apos; If I sign , I do so not as Chairman of my group , but in my own name , modest person that I am.&apos;
He went on to say that protectionism cannot make Europe wealthier ; protectionism would impoverish , not protect , our citizens .
I would ask you to try and be a little more realistic before you make such statements , Mr Desama .
To date , the 60 , 000 exiles who have been housed in temporary accommodation since 1992 and the children who have been effectively unable to lead normal lives since then have received little attention in European politics .
I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether we can have the Commission &apos;s position on the amendments in writing before the vote .
There are quite a lot of positives in this report , despite its being developed in the framework of the internal market , which the European Union advocates .
Whilst , to a certain extent , a number of the amendments which have been proposed to the report improve the situation , there are still one or two issues which need to be addressed , in my opinion .
The cuts in social benefits hit this group particularly hard , and we hope that the Commission can continue to monitor the Roma situation in both the old and the new Member States .
The debate about phthalates , which we have already had in connection with toys , must be urgently concluded with an independent scientific risk assessment .
Mr President , there are only a few hundred Hungarians living in Latvia today but if we believe in humane minority rights , however , then we must also mention their deprivation of rights .
The cost of this programme year on year is probably considerably less than is lost to the Community by fraud and incompetence .
I entirely support your reports - and of course I support my report as well , but I am probably not very objective on that .
( ES ) Mr President , exactly eight years ago this November , the Prestige , an oil tanker carrying 70 000 tonnes of crude oil , suffered an accident off the coast of Galicia causing a leak through which the tanker spilled 20 000 tonnes of oil .
It is impossible to work with an own @-@ resource limit of 1.27 % of Community GNP .
That is why it gives me special pleasure to turn to the gallery today and bid a very warm welcome to the ten prizewinners in the Robert Schuman essay competition organized by the Group of the European People &apos;s Party .
It has been a busy six months and the General Outline for the Revision of the Treaties is an impressive working document which is a clear reflection of the industriousness of the Irish presidency .
We will not give up until equal competitive conditions have been established .
The World Food Programme is hampered by difficult terrain , destroyed infrastructure and Taliban policies which prevent female participation , and which have led to the arbitrary arrest of aid workers on charges of religious proselytising and a ban on communications with the outside world , so essential to an international aid programme .
I would like to make it clear that , according to the proposal , the office will enjoy full freedom to conduct internal investigations on its own initiative inside the Commission and other institutions .
I am counting on you .
Leaving aside the jobs which have been undermined in registered businesses , the health implications of this are extraordinary .
The Commission condemns the renewed acts of terrorism in northern Macedonia and urges all the members of the Albanian minority to leave it to the two official Albanian parties to explain the demands of this ethnic minority within a democratic forum , either with the new government or with the special committee chaired by President Trajkovski .
We must be able to live in these areas .
It is , however , important in all cases that there are clear and binding expressions of political will , both internationally and on the part of those who can guarantee world peace and stability , that the non @-@ proliferation of nuclear arsenals is a high and non @-@ negotiable priority .
I should like to invite his Cabinet , or members of his Cabinet , or of his staff , to attend this meeting , which will be held in this House on 1 March .
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , it is a real shame , President Dini , that you arrived late this morning at the debate on preparations for the Florence European Council , as you would have been able to hear President Santer &apos;s speech which brought some politics into this debate rather than simply presenting us with a list of expenditure as you have done : frankly that could probably have been circulated as a working document .
Corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
The Council &apos;s rejection of the compromise solution , which was confirmed by two readings in the European Parliament and supported by groups right across the political spectrum on both the left and right , has come right at the time when across Europe there is an increasing number of jobs being lost , large companies are queuing up to announce their redundancy plans and ever @-@ increasing amounts of taxpayers &apos; money are being used to help banks which are in dire straits and to alleviate the damaging effects of the economic crisis .
Are we serious about this if , at the same time , we can adopt legislation that clearly infringes international conventions ?
Let us not be shy .
For instance , a few weeks ago a compensation fund for family members of CreutzfeldtJakob victims could only be squeezed out by pressure from the European Parliament .
No matter how the outcome of these elections is commented upon , it is a fact that the democratic forces won over 60 % of the votes cast , and , moreover , it happened now : not in a fight against Milosević , but in the fight for a democratic and European future for Serbia and Montenegro .
There must be a rapid improvement , especially in reaching out beyond the main hubs .
I support the general assessment regarding the need for the EU to redouble its efforts in order to prevent violations of fundamental human rights , which in too many cases have been suffered this year by immigrants and third @-@ country nationals who live in the European Union .
Another opportunity for putting general questions to Russia is afforded to the European Union by the human rights consultations between the two , which are held every six months .
We should take this lesson to heart , and not be afraid to say that totalitarianism - whether fascist or communist - is and always will be totalitarianism .
Mrs Barbara Dührkop , therefore , does not have an easy task .
In addition to this principle of carrot instead of stick , a detailed Commission action plan would help to improve the situation .
Mr Barón Crespo said &apos; justicia aplazada , justicia negada &apos; .
There is a clear disparity between the seriousness of what happened in Azerbaijan compared ...
I support Amendments Nos 24 and 26 .
But , quite honestly , we should also admit that the results of the ASEM III Summit in Seoul last year were not so terribly significant .
We must respect each other &apos;s culture and identity .
For months now you have claimed to be studying this question .
On these aspects , we should do everything we can within the context of the Partnership for Modernisation to help their roots to spread across Russia and develop .
As we said in our communication to you on the common position we do not agree with that and we consider that treating sports food separately is neither scientifically nor politically justified .
I hope that the Commission will submit comprehensive proposals to overcome the existing barriers to intraCommunity trade and ad hoc measures to deal with the Member States which do not apply the directives .
&apos;Recommends the Council to demand that Russia immediately sign and ratify the already negotiated border agreements with the accession states Estonia and Latvia.&apos;
I hope that my fellow MEPs are willing to think this through very carefully , as I believe this to be an interesting idea .
I have one question - is it in fact possible , from a comfortable government seat in Paris or Lisbon , to dispatch an appeal for the suspension of capital punishment to regions that are rife with cruelty and violence ?
The issue of climate change and the European Union &apos;s preparations for the Bali Conference have been a recurring theme during these monthly sessions that I have attended .
As to access by the national members of Eurojust , these will have the right to consult SIS data only if this right is compatible with the purposes for which the data were provided .
What we want is a world where no @-@ one will be injured or killed by landmines .
Indeed , it is of direct concern to the citizens of our respective countries , since it discusses European Union finances , and the citizens of Europe are entitled to ask for explanations regarding the use made of their money .
In countries where less than 10 % of the population now lives in rural areas , it is too easy for governments to sideline the needs of these areas , and the message from this debate must be that they do so at the peril of their countries .
I would like to cite two examples .
It is clear that the course we shall follow will fully involve the Parliament and the Council .
Let me recall in more detail the most important elements of these policies , already in place or under examination in this House : the draft directive guaranteeing 20 % renewables in our final energy consumption by 2020 ; the new rules to expand and strengthen the EU &apos;s Emissions Trading System ( ETS ) , ensuring that we meet our target of a 20 % greenhouse gas reduction by 2020 and establishing the ETS as driver for change ; the proposal for reducing CO2 emissions from cars and the Fuel Quality Directive that will oblige oil suppliers to progressively reduce their CO2 and energy consumption in the products they sell ; and , most importantly , the Energy Efficiency Action Plan , covering all sectors , at all levels , from the International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation to the Covenant of Mayors at the local level , to specific measures such as labelling of consumer goods or requirements for the energy efficiency of buildings .
I do not know any country in Europe whose national emblem does not make my flesh creep because of its long and bloody history .
Indeed , the very threat that that force might be established helped to calm things down last February .
The development of the highly specialised oil and financial industry will lead to greater demand for air travel .
These days , the complete dismantling of end @-@ of @-@ life vehicles is economically viable .
That is why we will vote against the Committee on Civil Liberties &apos; amendments .
Unfortunately , that means that company could show a severe degree of prejudice but it could also show a very positive degree of enlightenment .
Once again the EU has proven that it is the enemy of the people , of immigrants and of refugees , by handing the hostages over to the savage exploitation of capital .
For example , the humanitarian office , ECHO , had 38 officials in 1993 to manage an annual budget of ECU 100 million under very difficult conditions .
However , in high @-@ level meetings , as in our daily contacts with our partners , we are confronted with the fact that the European Union is little understood in India and its role hardly acknowledged .
All this is new for good reasons , and we have to be very careful not to overlap with what can in fact be funded through other sources , otherwise the opportunity would be wasted .
I am thinking in particular of U Win Tin , a journalist who , now aged 77 , has been in prison for nearly 20 years for writing a letter to the United Nations reporting the poor conditions under which political prisoners were being held .
This must be implemented using tax deductions , revised tax rates and compensation for fiscal drag in order to reduce poverty , and not just extreme poverty , and to promote consumption and economic growth by providing a counter @-@ cyclical response to the current economic crisis which presages a recession .
At 9.00 p.m. we shall resume the sitting , which will begin with a joint debate .
Among other important aspects , the proposal :
The framework programmes for research and technological development , which have been the main tool in the European Union ’ s implementation strategy , have been found , for various reasons and throughout their existence , to be inadequate in promoting the research and innovation potential of mainly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
I wonder whether the EU Human Rights Agency will provide that .
This would increase the predictability of the European Union ’ s Solidarity Fund decisions , thus reducing the workload in the Member States in preparing applications for support that have little or no chance of success .
I would remind you that the programme of the Irish Presidency contains 2 directives : one is being completed and for the other , which concerns problems in the field of optical radiation , a dialogue is due to start with the social partners , as is the first seminar of the Irish Presidency .
The proposal also aims to guarantee the protection of customers by setting appropriate information requirements .
I appeal to the Nepalese Government to take advantage of this opportunity to remedy the situation on fundamental rights in its country .
The agreement between the EU and Russia must inspire both the European Community and Russia to reap the reciprocal benefits resulting from the scientific and technical progress achieved through research programmes .
Recently , Prime Minister Putin &apos; s 2000 budget was approved but only because he has earmarked an additional billion dollars for the army in Chechnya , which means arms for Chechnya against the vote of the old Communists .
That was never likely to be negotiated with the Council , but we were able to make substantial progress from the Council &apos;s original proposal of 13 years .
I am most concerned by the Commissioner &apos;s suggestion that the option of offering the European baccalaureate outside the current school system should be considered .
Indeed , it is true that a petition can be presented via the Internet , but then written confirmation by the writers is always needed , which in fact makes this method redundant .
I believe that we must look more closely at the details , which means that the three institutions must sit down at the table .
So , relating to Tuesday , I propose that we bring forward the Council and Commission statements on the Turkish situation and enter them on the agenda instead of the statement on Iraq .
We must welcome immigrants and respect the diversity of their cultures , religions and traditions .
The Presidency will continue to raise this issue in the political contacts that take place between the European Union and Israel during our term .
Finally , Mr President , I want to tell you that I hope the Laeken European Council will enable us to give fresh impetus to the major task of establishing the area of freedom , security and justice , in the field of asylum and immigration as in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation , by accepting the gradual and pragmatic approach we are taking .
Such a thing is not commensurate with the importance of this proposal .
If I suppose the reason you use this criterion is to establish that either an industry has been materially harmed , perhaps through factories closing down or people being made unemployed , is it not a bit late then to say material damage has been done when the people are unemployed and the factories all shut .
A large sum of money , EUR 3.7 million to be precise , has been earmarked to support the United Nations and , more specifically , the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights , in order to help fund the participation of non @-@ governmental organisations , especially from countries which cannot meet their expenses .
These increases result in an inability to meet the basic food needs of the populations of all countries in the developing world .
There too , the European Union is doing everything it can .
In this context it deals , too , with a technical procedure , which can result in denying a product access to the market in another Member State , in spite of the fact that it is legally marketed in another country or in the Member State of origin .
The first relates to the geostrategic importance of Turkey , which has certainly increased as a result of the events which have just taken place and by the European Union &apos; s realisation of the need to enter into a coalition to combat Islamic fundamentalist terrorism .
You said that we are all in the same boat , and that everyone has to row ; I do not see everyone bent over the oars just yet , but I hope that will happen .
. – Looking at the conclusions of this Spring Conference and comparing them with what is actually happening in our economies and our societies , the only conclusion one can draw is that the gap between the policies and the citizens is widening .
It stresses principles agreed at the UN conference on environment and development in Rio and the conclusions of the Helsinki ministerial conference on sustainable woodland management and preserving the diversity of forests . The EU Member States have also committed themselves to these .
In the European Union &apos; s territory , in our territory , a whole range of completely intolerant attitudes and behaviour bordering on the fascistic is currently prevailing towards homosexuals .
It is precisely those legal affairs against which UN experts expressed their veto in a recommendation three years ago , that have now been included in the model adopted .
That comment clearly applies to the attempt to extend to wines the taxation applicable to alcoholic drinks .
However , Ireland &apos;s attention to detail had the merit of formally clarifying this point which , as I was saying , now applies to the entire European Union .
One example is Commissioner Wallström , who stated just this week that the Irish referendum actually had very little to do with the Treaty itself , but more to do with ethical issues and taxation .
We should exercise caution in the use of such terms , Mr Batten .
One must obviously deplore the constitutional upheaval brought about by the forces of Hun Sen and above all condemn the fact that human lives were lost .
( Applause )
This is our question , and we naturally want an answer .
The shipment authorization referred to in Article 15 ( 7 ) is the equivalent of an export licence .
Mr President , on behalf of my group I should like to congratulate Mrs RothBehrendt .
In political terms , I find it unreasonable that Parliament , which does not have the right to give its assent to the draft treaty , because it is denied that right by the Member States &apos; governments , should now feel obliged to recommend the ratification of such an inadequate treaty .
Mr President , as the late Tip O &apos;Neill said : &apos; All politics is local &apos; .
The other EUR 100m would enable the governments which are mainly dealing with the refugee problem to take certain measures to prevent destabilisation in their countries as a result of this unexpected massive influx .
So I would still ask that it be 9 o &apos;clock .
Generally speaking , the situation regarding the rights of minorities in the Western Balkans has improved in recent years , although significant progress still remains to be made .
The questions arising concern the nature and purpose of such amendments .
The opposite is true of course .
That will be a great day and an opportunity for celebration .
A second element on which we are agreed , and to which the rapporteur has already made reference , is that it should be clear who should cover the costs of security at airports .
Another issue is the financing of the universal service .
Thus , I have resurrected most of my / our demands from first reading , and once again , they have been unanimously adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights .
Question No 40 by Graham Watson ( H @-@ 0491 / 98 )
I regard the following elements as being particularly positive :
The next item is the debate on the report ( A5 @-@ 0290 / 2001 ) by Mr Radwan , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the
in writing . - ( EL ) The mid @-@ term review of the Financial Framework 2007 @-@ 2013 has been seen as a compromise with the 2005 decision and may be considered necessary in the current situation due to the economic crisis .
Thirdly , clear and strict regulations would eliminate the current distortions of competition when crop protection products are allowed to be used .
Despite limitations on trade and problems with training and access to information , to resources and to units of production , it cannot be emphasised enough that the underdevelopment of the LDCs results mainly from their decision makers &apos; lack of skill and their institutions &apos; inefficiency , as their people are so capable in other respects .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in conflict areas , the use of violence against women is a deliberate tactic .
Current polls in the Netherlands show that 82 % of Dutch voters would now vote ‘ no ’ – a tribute to the level @-@ headedness of that brave people .
It should also be obvious that the requisite funding must be guaranteed for these measures , while the flexibility instrument needs to be mobilised , or the financial perspective reviewed .
We must find ways of dealing with the problem of illegal immigration and fears in society .
Why is it shocked and horrified that the Union has to pay again ?
They paid with their lives for the insane irresponsibility of those who argue in favour of a murderer &apos;s right to life .
I thought to myself , if the Israeli Government has decided to take revenge for the victims of attacks in its own way , the Palestinian Authority &apos; s remaining small margin for manoeuvre will be greatly reduced .
It is said that we do not want to be ideological , but I fear that that is what we are in actual fact being .
I repeat , that is what health safety is all about .
The review of the directive is an excellent opportunity to put a stop to leaks of hazardous substances due to the lack of official collection points , irrational management and illegal shipments .
Einstein was right when he said that peace cannot be kept by force , it can only be achieved by understanding .
My second question concerns the role of the courts : If , as a result of the amendment of the Treaty , the EEC Courts will now determine issues concerning the Schengen Agreement , does this mean that Iceland and Norway are now under the jurisdiction of the EEC Courts ?
author . - Madam President , the clampdown on peaceful demonstrators some weeks ago sends an alarming message about the future of basic freedoms in Russia : freedoms of speech , the media and demonstrations .
The report by Mr Bertens , whom I congratulate on his excellent work , is a major step in the right direction and we must therefore vote in favour of it .
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market . ( ES ) Mr President , I would like once again to congratulate the Commission on having presented us with a raft of proposals intended to facilitate the adaptation of the European Union to the realities of the new European society .
It is always possible to do more and to do it better , but the truth is that , as I have already said , there is a series of legal instruments which duly correspond to this desire to effectively combat this type of offence .
And if I am being accused ....
This is to ignore the reality that what we have at the moment is a discordant , incoherent chorus of European countries and their 14 thousand or so diplomats , compared to the 3 500 diplomats of the United States .
This new legislation will protect those consumers purchasing products on line - customers will now have a period of two weeks in which to change their mind about on @-@ line purchases .
Through its experience , Iceland may also make a valuable contribution to EU policy in the field of renewable energy , particularly in the areas of the exploitation of geothermal energy , environmental protection and combating climate change .
As a consequence , I think that those who voted in favour of this resolution are also in favour of eradicating the principle of compulsory expenditure .
Tribute
The first , to which my colleague referred , is political dialogue .
I hope that Member States will see fit to transpose all elements of this important directive before the final deadline for implementation in order to give parents , as consumers , greater peace of mind .
It also recognises that European residential mortgage markets have different features from other mortgage markets in the world and that they are of particular importance to the European Union banking system .
Just allow me to give you an example involving money from the Solidarity Fund .
Would it not be marvellous if we could do the same with weapons ?
If France – to name but one country – gets what it wants and the embargo on China is lifted , the European Union will lose all the credibility it has .
I think this could strengthen dialogue , not only in spirit .
The big issue is moving forward to create real international governance .
Our current humanitarian assistance is focusing on cholera , using EUR 22 million to cover the most essential needs in terms of healthcare , access to proper water supplies and sanitation , information campaigns , epidemiological surveillance and logistics .
In line with the encouragement by Parliament and expressed in the resolution and during the debate , the High Representative / Vice @-@ President and her services will continue resolutely to promote universal accession to the Rome Statute .
( Applause )
I praise the drafting of this report which , apart from analysing the condition of women in rural areas , also proposes concrete recommendations in order to improve their condition in the context of globalisation and achievement of the Lisbon goals .
However , we are critical in this respect .
We should really push ahead with that and have several ideas on how to better enforce the rules .
If there is no agreement on this , it is because the British Government , whose cooperation we have welcomed on all the issues I just mentioned , simply cannot throw off the shadow of Mrs Thatcher and agree to regulate these matters in the treaty .
In view of the importance of this report and of the vote on Thursday which will be closely followed , with three minority opinions and roll @-@ call votes , particularly with regard to agriculture , I would consider it deplorable if this House were to begin Question Time without at least one speaker per group having spoken .
That is why the President of the ECB will be appointed for a term of eight years .
I would like to stress that this is not only about the rights of an individual victim , but about collective rights , which bring with them the responsibility to remember , so that this type of violation does not happen again .
The key to achieving our ambitions in the area of the recycling and recovery of packaging waste is setting attainable targets based on realistic expectations .
11 .
At that point , the European parties are essentially machines .
The successful candidates were then allowed to compete and , finally , contractors for different lots were then chosen on the basis of cost and quantity .
I am not saying it is simple .
After all , as Mr McCreevy , the Commission &apos;s spokesman and Mr Bolkestein &apos;s successor , has just emphasised , we have to be realistic – there have been referendums in France and in the Netherlands .
Mrs van Bladel did indeed refer to a point in my speech about the kind of force that the United Nations is to send to this territory .
We now know that despite the implementation of an ambitious policy to combat climate change we can only stabilise the phenomenon , and we therefore have to adapt to its consequences .
Yes , women encounter specific difficulties .
This directive is actually intended to deal with illegal discharges from ships made either through negligence , deliberate intent or carelessness .
I would like to say that this is a complex issue .
If we believe in partnership in development then we should respect their wishes .
That comes to almost EUR 3 billion .
Where I differ with the rapporteur , however , is with his concerns on spectrum auctions .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is naturally useful to have a report on arms trade .
The progress already made needs to be followed by further implementation , further improvements and the allocation of both adequate funding and staffing levels .
Mr President , Mrs Győri , Mr Barroso , ladies and gentlemen , what will the European public take away from the meeting of its leaders this Friday in Brussels ?
The next item is the debate on the Commission and Council statements on the EU / Latin American Summit of 17 and 18 May 2002 in Madrid .
They announced this in one single document , which they all signed , so I think we can quite easily call this the resignation of all the members of the Commission .
My group and I have voted in favour of the part on authorisation being adopted , and we did so , even though we are opposed to temporary authorisation for substances being restricted to five years .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work .
That is , in my view , the path we need to follow .
These people have come here to demonstrate against the Services Directive , and this is not the first time that the people of Europe are letting us know that they are not in favour of this liberalisation proposal .
I believe that , in the current challenge , the most competitive advantage will be that part of the world will not only be energy @-@ efficient , but will also be capable of managing demand .
However , we support the proposal to create a lending facility within the EIB , to be evaluated after it has been in operation for a year .
Statistics have to be comprehensive , reliable and consistent .
Hence , it is our duty to protect the freedom of WikiLeaks and to guarantee fair treatment for Julian Assange , who should pay for his crimes , if proven , in a fair trial .
While numbers of applications for protection and of immigrants arriving are low in some countries , there are many other countries that are unable to tackle on their own the pressure their borders are subjected to on a daily basis .
The USA has for a long time been a partner that is accepted by both sides , and we recognise and respect its role and its importance in the region .
Discrimination , however , occurs in all areas of people &apos;s daily lives . It follows that we must adopt a horizontal approach and integrate this factor into all political domains .
That is why we have competition rules and a competition authority which , as you know , is the Commission .
On the other hand , there is the market in traditional games of chance and traditional sports betting , which tend to take place in written form .
I hope that we , the European Parliament and the Commission , will together be able to fill that gap in order to try to achieve a little more consistency at European level , because we do , in fact , need that ambition .
In this context the blending of olive oil with other vegetable oils , in the absence of labelling that will identify each component in the blend , damages the image of the producer , the consumer and the Codex Alimentarius .
The Council regrets that the sad reality in Afghanistan shows that , so far , the Taliban have been unreceptive to arguments and pressure from outside , despite the efforts of the Union and of the international community .
The first question is : why can we not draw from all this such a basic conclusion as this ?
Because to participate , although in a very modest way , in the process of repealing Regulation 17 of 1962 , against which I have fought a long @-@ standing battle and on which I have written repeatedly in a very critical manner , is , I must confess , hugely gratifying .
In the course of European unification , linguistic diversity has gradually become less of a barrier and more of an opportunity .
In this way the resource flows arising from the European Union aid effort and bilateral programmes can be enlarged and vitalised .
I believe that the only way we can tackle this problem is through a global response .
Advertising , in view of its specific national characteristics , is a suitable area for self @-@ regulation , far more sensitively reflecting national cultural traditions , customs and models .
In some Member States the postal sector fulfils a special function , such as in rural areas , and we cannot simply ignore this .
My third point relates to human rights .
It will be aimed at supporting EU citizens ’ networking and participation in the debate on Europe .
So it is not entirely impossible .
As regards Amendment No 4 , the Commission has its doubts .
( FR ) Excuse me , but you have unfortunately forgotten the original wording of paragraph 45 .
I do not think , therefore , that we need be overly concerned about this , and the composition of the Economic and Financial Committee must be as before : it must contain representatives of the central banks of the relevant Member States .
In other words , for example , just as the charges for the use of a mobile phone or a credit card in any part of the European Union are subsequently charged to our bank accounts , we are trying to create a similar situation for road tolls : that the use of an infrastructure in a third country is charged to our bank account .
But the problem with this report is it risks setting aside the rule of law , as several points are not sufficiently clear .
The Council is aware of this and will not shrink from urging the Algerian Government to adopt a controlled approach to the crisis . In so doing it must not , I repeat not , overstep the mark on human rights .
This article states that areas selected for housing operations shall comply with at least three of the criteria listed in the article .
By means of suitable economic and social policies we must transform the Mediterranean into a sea of peace - an area that is completely non @-@ nuclear .
It is a waste in terms of our competitiveness when we compare , for example , the mobility of this type of foreign citizen in the United States , for example , or in China , India or Brazil , and then see the obstacles to their mobility within the European Union .
We voted against Amendments Nos 1 to 13 and the proposal , as we wished the proposal in its current form to be withdrawn .
A blue @-@ card question is not addressed to plenary in general or to the Commissioner or the Council representative .
I could cite other examples , but I prefer to draw conclusions about what can be learnt from a Presidency that has concluded its term of office in a positive way .
And Mr Schäfer is absolutely right to mention the work of the Westendorp Group in this connection , because that was indeed the starting point and that group specifically dwelt on what is meant by the status and role of citizen .
What has been discussed is the fact that the eurozone and the European Union as a whole are growing less than other areas of the world .
I also wish to raise the issue of the agreement on transferring personal data in connection with flights , otherwise known as the Passenger Names Records ( PNR ) agreement .
Madam President , there is a lack of movement in the area of justice and home affairs .
. ( PT ) As the report states , compliance with the common fisheries policy depends to a large extent on the participation of the fishermen and their associations in the decision @-@ making process .
Of course , we also want to use the new possibilities to continue - and maybe to intensify - to be partners in the international arena .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mrs Ashton , ladies and gentlemen , the European instrument for democracy and human rights is the financing instrument that supports human rights , the rule of law , the protection of democracy and the prevention of conflicts around the world .
Somebody raised the question of whether these schools are like ghettos or some place that nobody wants to go .
I am convinced that it will serve as an inspiration to your courageous husbands , just as the interest of the free world was an inspiration for me during the darkest times of my imprisonment .
This latter measure is worth emphasising , because I feel that the EU needs to do more to help SMEs , which are a real spearhead of innovation and job creation in the Europe of 25 .
A unified Europe , without the dividing lines of the past , is the ultimate objective .
In the negotiations , the European Union must not give in to Russia &apos;s blackmail attempts with regard to energy and must clearly address abuses of human rights .
( Parliament adopted the Commission proposal )
Mr President , I raise a point of order pursuant to Rules 127 and 52 .
Concerns over investment , support for small firms , assistance for companies that employ large numbers of people , working conditions , the gradual reduction in maximum working hours and improving the management thereof , wages , social protection , training leading to genuine qualifications and appropriate education systems all give a social meaning to the terms of adaptability and employability , which , without that guidance , would be cynical objectives , concerned only with economics , as I would like the Commission to remember .
It is said , in French at least , that this will not affect the essentially proportional nature of the voting system .
I therefore ask you to approve the proposal I have submitted , which takes the needs of specific new small European Union countries and their societies into account , to support countries , which do not have the capacity to create audio visual products of sufficient quality through grants .
Now , however , crisis management forces actually have nothing to do in the different parts of Europe in which they are stationed .
There is , of course , one thing that we can be sure of . If someone is employed illegally because he can no longer survive in his own country , he does not have the option of going to the police and saying that he is being exploited .
We have sugar refineries : the Commission is going to pay them not to produce anything .
Acting on behalf of the European Union , the Member States must aim at tabling a draft resolution on a general moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty , with a view to its abolition . They should garner maximum support for this resolution amongst the Member States of the UN .
Parliament should pursue the initiative , suggesting responsibly whatever amendments it considers appropriate , whilst strictly respecting the current legal framework .
I believe that we need to give Moldova very clear signals from the European institutions and the European Union as a whole , and provide the necessary support , both financial and economic .
Does the Commissioner have an understanding with Member States that they will not top up their vehicle taxation as a means of recovering income lost as a result of lower prices , thereby wiping out the economic benefit to consumers ?
We really do not need this , considering the serious problems we are facing with integration and resolving the extremely severe problem of the Roma .
At any time , Parliament can obtain further information on request .
However , with regard to the allocation and use of the amount you refer to , and which appears fair to me , I should point out that this is an agreement entered into by the Commission and ten Member States , which means that the Council , as an institution , is not a party to the matter .
Mr President , the Commission ’ s proposal for a regulation contains a methodological flaw .
These changes , however well @-@ meaning , will actually have the effect of setting back the process of achieving equality for working mothers .
That is something you should know .
Only eight months after this request , you have now endorsed the result of the very constructive discussions between Parliament , the Council and the Commission .
This , then , is the underlying reason why we considered it opportune and necessary to revise the framework agreement , the main instrument governing relations between our institutions .
It is therefore with some satisfaction that I have received the assurance of your services that the European Investment Bank did not grant this request and that it considers that its job is to support projects in Jordan aimed at developing wind and solar power , which are energies of the future for our planet because they are renewable .
I am not accepting any more speeches ; I am sorry , but we are in the middle of voting .
Otherwise we will repeat the mistakes made in the TEN @-@ T programme , which has claimed that projects such as Nord Stream are European .
In the last decade , we have seen unprecedented development in the different types of financial innovation and new instrument available .
I have to say that it is not so simple .
I am afraid to say , President Prodi , that your programme is rather vague on this point , not to say slightly rhetorical .
The idea prevailed for a long time that protection of the environment and sustainable development were luxury items that could not be discussed , let alone achieved , until a society had developed to a certain level .
However , having said this , we must not ignore the other side of the coin .
With regard to point 5 ( e ) , as I indicated in July , I share Parliament &apos;s view of the need to strengthen multiannual programming and strategic planning , together with the Council .
We can only hope that the banks really are aware of this .
Now all of a sudden , in the middle of that process , along comes a new instrument , the European Partnerships .
I therefore call on the players in Bosnia and Herzegovina to adopt the anti @-@ corruption act and lay down rules for the exchange of information between the different parts of the police service as quickly as possible .
I await with interest the result of the field trials currently being carried out in my own country , to see whether they provide any evidence on the effects of biodiversity .
As you suggested , Commissioner , preferences for countries such the Windward Islands harm no one and are not aimed at damaging the trade of Latin American exporters or of any other exporters .
Such a step would be a gross overreaction as well as being illegal .
It only needs seven citizens in an organising committee , not 300 000 as the Commission proposed , nor 100 000 as the Council envisaged , seven citizens from seven different countries , that is a quarter of the Member States .
Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating Commissioner Georgieva on the effective coordination work that she has undertaken and indeed the discussions that she is having with Baroness Amos at the UN .
It is also true that this report was , to a large extent , drafted prior to the summit .
An instrument at EU level implementing the WTO decision has great symbolic value as an external demonstration of the EU ’ s commitment to the decision .
On the contrary , in this regulation we have indicated , yet again , that this arrangement is needed only until the final measures have been proposed and adopted .
The European Union cannot sacrifice agriculture for the sake of WTO negotiations , and that the European Union has already done a lot for developing countries – for instance , 85 % of African food exports arrive in the European Union .
I agree in principle with this view , Commissioner , but I fear that the process , including its individual components , will not be at all easy .
It allowed the participants , amongst other things , to take a further step towards resuming a high @-@ level dialogue that could , eventually , restore the trust that would be needed before negotiations on the final status could resume .
Like Monnet , Spinelli offered Europe his vision and his achievements .
( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in principle , we all agree that the SET plan is to be welcomed .
It is perhaps not surprising that we were discussing bananas today because , taking all those things into account , many people consider that we have gone a bit bananas .
If this is indeed the case , I foresee major problems in many sectors of agriculture , and especially in the livestock sector .
There is an urgent need to act .
I view this as one of the tools for ensuring sustainable development of the regions , with emphasis on protection of natural and cultural heritage and its preservation for future generations .
Broadly speaking , we welcome this proposal on the liability of carriers of passengers by sea .
Firstly , to a social Europe , permitting full equality between men and women , but also to a respect for countries ’ different cultures .
Member States are required to fingerprint every third @-@ country national over 14 who is apprehended in connection with the irregular crossing of their border - that is not very precise .
The recruitment procedure for officials of the European Union is governed by the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities and thus solely by Community law .
Furthermore , if we minimise multilingualism in our external communications , we may end up distancing an institution which expends a great deal of energy trying to bring the EU closer to its citizens .
Do you not consider , Mr Kallas , that the aforesaid option A is discriminatory in respect of Italian pupils ?
Finally , you say , Commissioner , that this case cannot be compared to SWIFT because it concerns a very specific investigation , which is true .
I would like to explain that at national level this type of support is a matter for Member States , within certain legal limits laid down in the Treaty .
Adequate exceptions must therefore be included in the directive , hence the proposal that , for airports situated in these regions , the rules laid down in the directive will not apply where they will not guarantee compliance with the universal public service obligations .
The departments have worked hard to get me all the details I need to give Mr Falconer an answer as promised .
The aim of my explanation of vote in favour of the recommendation by the Council is simply to join in the significant debate which we have just completed and which has made us privileged joint protagonists in the chapter of European history that we are writing today .
I would also like to emphasise how much he will be missed in this Parliament , in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , and in the Committee on Fisheries .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , as many of the previous speakers have remarked , I too am obliged to describe the Cardiff Summit as something of a disappointment .
This is also a major success for Parliament , granted that 80 % of the amendments it tabled at first reading have been incorporated in the common position .
I believe your applause is a clear indication of the fact that we are all in agreement that I should announce the indignation of this House to Afghanistan .
As ever , our main attention is directed at the former Yugoslavia .
The first is the serious situation European transport finds itself in at present , bearing in mind too the forecasts provided by all the studies received .
Any crime was justified to bring about what they saw as the ideal world and to protect it from change forever .
‘ Today ’ , he said in 1954 , ‘ hundreds of thousands live in freedom exiled from Spain and the rest live in Spain exiled from freedom ’ .
The Commission considers that suppressing this part of the liability regime is unacceptable since this would weaken the proposal .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would first of all like to welcome the fact that the inter @-@ institutional Conciliation Committee has managed to reach agreement , and that the market in international rail passenger transport services within the European Union will therefore be opened up in 2010 .
Sustainable development cannot be achieved without developing new environmental technology and innovations , especially in the transport and energy sectors .
Does the Charter not endorse human rights , enshrined in constitutional traditions and common to all Member States ?
I believe Europe also has a job to do there .
Do you foresee preparation of something in the way of a programme for realisation of the strategy , a separate document for the Commission &apos;s five @-@ year term of office , which would set out the actions to be implemented ?

At stake are the credibility of our Parliament and the wellbeing of our fellow citizens , who would not understand - and rightly so - if we were to commit them to long @-@ term courses of action that we did not discuss calmly and exhaustively beforehand , taking into account the different national situations and the constraints of our common fight against climate change .
Moreover , it does not matter whether the standpoints from which these decisions are taken are different or whether they can coexist in a single document ; the truth of the matter is that we - in our committees and in our daily work - constantly perform a task of convergence , study and analysis , of laborious recording of the issues , something we are doing now .
The strategy pursues the overarching goal of enhancing coherence between policies at the different levels . In this way , we can give proper , broad consideration to policy decisions that have an impact on our competitiveness and the future prosperity of our societies .
In 1999 we had a budget - I say this to the ladies and gentlemen of the Council in particular , I am reminding you of this because it is a matter which affects us all - in 1999 , Commissioner , we had a budget of EUR 96 billion .
I declare this session of the European Parliament adjourned .
We are faced with the challenge of making the European economy the most competitive in the world and , in my opinion , it is unacceptable to create a burden which will result in the outflow of capital from Europe .
I believe that the Commission &apos;s proposal on minimum standards for the reception of refugees is very significant .
This is the way to implement this agenda .
Stabilisation of Afghanistan : challenges for the EU and the international community (
Madam President , I hope that when I give my explanation of vote I do not provoke the same sort of petty responses that one can expect from the other side of the House .
On that basis , we can talk about what we are , or are not , to do .
I believe we can reach a consensus here : we have a good proposal and this is now to be improved upon by Mr van Dam .
So I am joining in the plea for some European assistance for this area .
It is good that a discussion is also under way in the respective institutions to ensure that everything is ready and can be handled in a formally absolutely correct way .
I am very grateful for this attention to these important issues , which may have also some implications concerning Bulgaria &apos;s standing in the markets .
You will be receiving the Moderate delegation &apos; s &quot; yes &quot; vote tomorrow .
On the other hand , it attempted to lay the foundations of a completely new political system .
The answer is clear : the Reform Treaty strengthens the European Union without doing away with democracy .
Three years after the entry into force of this environmental regulation , the Commission has now presented the European Parliament and the Council with an assessment of the way in which the regulation has been applied .
Instead it is a right subject to conditions , whether procedural in nature or material conditions regarding the definition of the status of the family members in the country to which they have been admitted and regarding the rights that they enjoy .
In an Internet poll , the number of respondents declaring themselves in favour of such a measure was as high as 96 % .
As I said earlier , my fate is in the hands of this Parliament .
I think he has been a good friend to agriculture and the countryside and many others share my view , even if I do not always see eye to eye with him .
We urge America to renounce the deployment of its military forces in Uzbekistan , which requires huge payments that essentially contribute to the further strengthening of President Karimov ’ s regime .
The European Union - and I believe Mr Sylla is right - has no choice but to give its emphatic support to this Government , without , however , misjudging the reality in Somalia .
This demonstrates the excellent work of negotiation and consensus carried out by the rapporteur and the cooperation of the whole committee on this report which was not devoid of difficulties , owing , above all , to the occupation of part of the island by Turkey and the stalemate in the dialogue between the Turkish and Cypriot Governments .
To help achieve this legal certainty , a non @-@ exhaustive list of unfairness categories and a list of examples of banned commercial practices will supplement the general clause .
It means that e @-@ money must be redeemed for cash on request minus any deductions for legitimate costs in carrying out the transactions .
It is anyhow worthwhile to fight for it .
The Commissioner &apos;s reply was at first sight satisfactory , but I should like to put a few supplementary questions , first of all on taxation .
The report as a whole emphasises , however , that the agreements are of benefit both to the EU and to third countries .
What new solutions do you offer in response to the increasing rejection of the galloping ever @-@ growing threat to job security and even to life itself ?
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
The report that has been presented is a necessary continuation of what has gone before , while also proposing the expected changes .
I am also obliged to you for endorsing the procedure we suggested : I know from my talks and discussions in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs how hard it has been for some of you to do so .
Even more important : does the Council agree with this proposal ?
On the contrary , these management committees are a quality check .
Precisely that agreement is of great importance to South Africa because , after the years of economic boycott , South African agriculture and industry need a chance to grow and export , to Europe as well .
We do need to look at our rating agencies , but please remember that they have not got everything wrong .
You have reinforced the aspirations voiced in Luxembourg and you want to add to the value of the results obtained .
And this becomes even more remarkable if you think that certain of these works concern what we are talking about now , namely respect for the environment and the need to address traffic congestion in certain sensitive areas of our continent .
that the necessary broadcasting licence fees are charged and this is not prevented or put at risk by a policy of competition in the audiovisual field that is geared purely to the private sector , and that @-@ important events of what is called mass culture still cannot be appropriated by the private sector or used commercially , i.e. , that important sports events , for instance , can continue to be broadcast uncoded and by public sector organizations.Naturally we particularly support several important Green statements , for instance on the concept of broadcasting , which have been incorporated in Parliament &apos;s resolution since spring 1996 .
There is thus a clearly perceptible trend towards migration into Austria from the Indian subcontinent and Iraq by way of Belarus and the Ukraine .
Why should we have two inspection systems ?
Finally , I agree with Mr Mulder that the Community needs to be very careful about protecting its quality policy in international forums .
in writing . - I voted in favour of this important resolution because it is high time to pay attention to Chemical , Biological , Radiological and Nuclear ( CBRN ) risks which present a new dimension of possible terrorist attacks , accidents , natural disasters and / or pandemics due to their transnational character and mass @-@ scale victimisation .
It is now on the brink of extinction , and we are demanding stricter protection regulations for many parties to the Convention , in particular to prevent the illegal trade in the body parts and derivatives of the tiger .
Our judicial system is recovering in effectiveness and credibility from the damages of war .
That is not always the case , which is highly regrettable .
We have had situations where , because of the lack of rights for homosexual couples , people have been evicted from local authority housing on the death of the other partner who was the named tenant .
In order to undertake this task , the Commission makes use of a range of information from very diverse sources , paying particular attention to the data and statistics from the States Members that it collects from actions undertaken by certain specialised working groups in the Council .
As you have reminded us , President Barroso says we cannot have more Europe for less money .
We must therefore establish the funding requirements in this area , with the aim of increasing the European Union &apos;s competitiveness globally .
I agree with the position set out in the resolution that the European Union should take a leading role in the climate negotiations and actively contribute to a more constructive climate conference in Cancún .
I am therefore delighted that Parliament has voted in favour of these two new States joining the Schengen area .
( The sitting was opened at 09 : 00 )
I should therefore like to thank Mr Medina Ortega warmly on his achievements as rapporteur on this occasion .
It goes without saying that it would be impossible to introduce any new provisions inconsistent with the case law since this could be achieved only by a Treaty amendment .
Eight competences are listed in the report , but I personally believe that the fifth competence , ‘ learning to learn ’ , is one of the more important , because lifelong learning is a process .
Working with the Union for the Mediterranean , we now have a consistent framework for our neighbourhood policy , which is without doubt one of the main priorities of the Union &apos;s external relations .
In practice , people travelling by coach from Brussels to Amsterdam will not be protected whereas those travelling by air will be !
The money is most welcome ; it makes a big difference .
I hope that we can quickly reach an agreement at institutional level on this last point .
In principle , we are sympathetic towards &apos; fair trade &apos; , but we do not think that the support measures should be concentrated on this type of production .
Lung cancer is the most deadly .
The market is essential to wealth creation and it is with this in mind that we want to argue for five more points here :
Honourable Member , I share your concern and support it .
The effectiveness of all those measures is questionable .
Lastly , Mr President , I would like to express my concern at a complex case of hypocrisy which Parliament and the European institutions have failed to address : on the one hand , they regularly , emotionally , bring up the issue of human rights , for the protection of human rights is a symbol of our political prowess and pride , yet , on the other , they are reluctant to apply the clause providing for the suspension of economic and commercial relations with those countries which systematically violate these rights , and not just in the case of Laos .
The extremely varied funding framework in the EU , which is nonetheless indispensable for business , must be kept .
European External Action Service (
In the occupied territories the situation is tragic .
Of course Germany can sell Mercedes because it is a Mercedes , but how can my country , which has no proprietary products , sell to America - the big market - when it can find the same product in a neighbouring country outside EMU for a third of the price ?
But the people take note of these recantations and will , one day , reject them , or indeed the Western world will come to an end .
I totally disagree with this .
The Presidency has also undertaken to improve the quality of public debates and increase the interest these generate , partly through preparing the debates better .
Mr President , Gordon Brown said today that there will be no need for another EU Treaty for at least 10 years .
Corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
The June List does not , however , wish to contribute to any Fortress Europe .
Secondly , if an accession candidate country had an identical law to the unmodified version of the Hungarian law , could it conclude the relevant negotiation chapter ?
Article 18 refers to best practices , by maintaining that the experience built up both at national and at regional and local levels should be disseminated and used in other countries .
I very much doubt whether the Commission currently possesses the resources and commitment to set about strengthening , as other speakers have already mentioned , the Customs systems of these Visegrad countries .
There is nothing in the report about any new legislation , either at EU level or in the Member States .
We will support this at any rate .
Then , there was a press statement from Europabio , which was not very helpful in this regard and , following which , I wrote a letter to the chairman of Europabio pointing out that such an ambivalent position on the patent involved was not at all helpful in furthering people &apos; s understanding of biotechnology .
They and everybody must help to try to stop what is happening in Darfur . It is an absolute catastrophe .
The debate is closed .
In addition , there are air @-@ traffic links with 90 countries that are not internationally recognised to be free of foot @-@ and @-@ mouth disease and infection .
At the heart of our cultural self @-@ image is the desire to fight against Hollywood &apos;s dominance , to show our own films , characterised as they are by European diversity , and to facilitate their production and distribution .
But I find that , once again , the rapporteur and the Committee on Budgetary Control fail to draw the right conclusions from the Court of Auditors &apos; analysis . In fact , just as it did for 1994 , the Court of Auditors felt it could not give positive global assurances on the legality and regularity of the operations underlying the payments for the 1995 financial year .
Can I assure the minister that we all want to look after the citizens &apos; health and the environment , but does the Council agree with the call for a European Commission impact assessment on the effects of food production and food supply because of this legislation in each Member State ?
The discussions at the summit will also take stock of the situation regarding the Financial Perspectives for 2007 @-@ 2013 .
I have one reservation : we cannot have all the Member States , as well as the Commission , working with NGOs everywhere .
On the other hand it has been observed - and this cannot be denied - that the ceiling system actually punishes those hauliers that try to adopt ecologically friendly procedures , as has been said , while instead encouraging bad practice , as you well know , and even fraudulent practices : for instance , many lorries go in with a bill of lading , unload in Austria and then leave , and so are not subject to the points clause .
We must also push economic and social policies to raise the purchasing power of low @-@ income families .
I am for young people : if we were not young once , we would never have been able to grow old .
( PT ) I voted against this report , not because I consider less widely @-@ spoken European regional languages to be undeserving of respect , protection and dissemination , but because I feel that the rapporteur &apos;s approach to this question gives impetus to separatist tendencies within the Member States .
It was Winston Churchill , as we have just been reminded , who sketched out the vision of a United States of Europe – and let me add that Europe could never be complete without Great Britain .
These initiatives , together with effective systems of control , are the key aspects for the future of fisheries .
Market regulations should not replace the requirements of the law - and therefore the duties - which apply to everyone .
Madam President , I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Grosch , for his excellent cooperation both during the first reading and now during the second reading .
All this leads us to the second risk that we must avoid : interpreting the fight against terrorism as grounds providing justification for revising , reducing and altering the scope of fundamental rights .
I am informed when I take a closer look that the information is in fact quite higgledy @-@ piggledy with bits coming from here and there and no clear , proper economic and biological picture emerging .
The indicators show rising levels of debt which pose a real problem , especially in terms of long @-@ term budget stability , across the whole of the Union .
The time we were allotted was very short .
As regards the number of Members of Parliament , Mr President , there was practically no debate : the countries with smaller populations asked for one more Member , taking the number from four to five , and all the other countries assented .
Taken together , all three laws that we are adopting are milestones for the EU &apos;s internal market .
The European Council currently comprises an odd combination of executive and representative authority .
The Commission can therefore accept this amendment in principle .
If our institution fails to take this opportunity offered by the IGC it will bear a heavy responsibility , because if these errors continue the very idea of Europe is likely to be in jeopardy .
This is why we will continue to work in harmony with all the Member States , with the Council and also with countries outside Europe that are particularly involved in combating piracy .
It depends on its exports of iron ore and fishing - just two things .
That is why the Copenhagen process which , since 2002 , has been laying the foundations of greater cooperation in terms of the Member States &apos; policies with regard to vocational education and training , is particularly important .
I was unsurprised by the depth of common ground between us on the crucial issue of the EU &apos;s Aid for Trade .
It should put them under the heading of prosperity , because until we learn that the environment and green growth is part of prosperity rather than solidarity , we will not have the correct perspective on such matters .
The fourth issue concerns ending the random operation of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) by implementing a systemic organisation of the policy with a focus on long @-@ term objectives . The fifth and final issue involves putting a stop to the agricultural decline in the new Member States caused by the CAP &apos;s discriminatory principles , while significantly boosting utilisation of wasted agricultural potential in these countries , the new Member States .
With your assent , ladies and gentlemen , by the summer we will again have a fully functioning Commission under undisputedly competent leadership .
in writing . - We sit here as a House representing 27 nations .
In the case of Amendment No 18 , we take the view that Parliament &apos;s remit to make legislative proposals for a title in the EU budget does not really allow it to propose such an amendment , because it seeks to dictate what the Commission is to do with the money allocated to the budget line in question .
I am thinking of the naming of the European Commissioners , and of our acceptance by majority , under pressure from the governments , of the economic agreement with Turkey .
I would inform you that I have received seven draft resolutions , submitted pursuant to Article 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules .
Holding companies have a guidance function and are in a position to finance investment even in insurance companies by drawing on outside funds .
I was extremely pleased to vote for the legislation concerning working conditions of drivers engaged in road transport activities .
We shall inform him of this request .
Only with a reformed aid system will olive growing be directed towards the often declaimed policy of quality utilized on the market and in an ever more attentive and demanding consumer .
I have therefore voted in favour of the Agreement , which will allow all European Union air carriers to operate flights between any Member State and Vietnam .
The European Council welcomed the four @-@ presidency initiative led by Ireland , the Netherlands , Luxembourg and the UK , which will drive this issue forward as a priority over the next two years .
Shoppers who choose produce with the Fair Trade mark play a vital role in alleviating poverty and supporting marginalised producers in a manner that promotes dignity and self @-@ sufficiency .
In this way , following the Vienna Summit , President Santer labelled the positions adopted by Heads of State and Government as being &apos; purely tactical &apos; and went on to state that the final agreement would be based on the Commission &apos;s proposals .
In that I take pride , and I wish you all the best for the future .
The social dumping practised by the road industry or the scandal involving motorway concessions , for example , are not challenged in any way .
If we have a common European market but we still have to pay roaming bills , it shows quite clearly that we still have a long way to go before we achieve our aim of economic integration .
The same Member of Parliament asked about jurisdiction .
Please could the Commission consider this ?
In so doing , we were basically already anticipating the Council &apos;s reaction to our budgetary requests .
Firstly , I would like to say that the protocol agreed between Guinea and the European Union is beneficial to both parties .
One step at a time , we shall get there .
The Council also decided on the distribution key to be applied in the allocation between Member States of this additional compensation .
Unemployment indicators have begun to worsen .
This workshop will focus on possible policy options for the revision of the Package Travel Directive , including all the issues that have been mentioned during this debate .
The proposals contained in this report are intended to provide the work of the various Community institutions with greater coherence , putting an end to the de facto contradictions and to the particular predominance of the political will of the Council in this field , because in our opinion , the fact that the Union does not have a position of its own , expressed with a single voice , causes us to act on the international stage according to necessity or under the changing leadership of others who do not always share our interests in this field .
We do not accept the constant marginalisation of the Presidents of Parliament and of the Commission .
These are the poles of the axis which defines a sustainable Europe .
Mr Chairman , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of my group , and in particular of my two Irish party colleagues , I wish to express our twofold sense of shock .
Faced with extreme situations , such as that of Nigeria , we can only use extreme measures .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue @-@ card question from Mr Leichtfried under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
As we have not resolved the issue of the retention of data once and for all , which is what the Committee and the Commission had had in mind , I do wonder to what degree we can call this an outright success .
This issue of fingerprinting an ethnic group falls under the competence of the European Parliament and we should firmly decide that the EU countries be subordinated to the European legislation in this field .
We strongly oppose it because it runs counter to the interests of the citizens and to the interests of workers and of European consumers , but also because it jeopardises citizens ’ support for the European project .
in writing . - British Labour MEPs joined with the Socialist Group in voting in favour of this report .
The goal , therefore , is that existing values in the new Member States - in this case rail service - should not fall victim to the opening up of the internal market , but should instead become a valuable part of it .
The EU and the international community cannot , and should not , look on silently .
I have already spoken about putting forward a range of trust @-@ building measures to guarantee the continuation and support of the peace process .
That might be one way of coming to an arrangement .
I fully endorse the reasonable position adopted by the rapporteur , which the Finance Ministers could also live with .
.
Secondly , they must realise that this is not just a question of agricultural prices , export refunds and compensatory payments , important as they are .
This is , of course , a daunting challenge , and one that we welcome .
Four years later , the two institutions have seen fit to amend certain articles of the regulation , in order to improve the assistance it provides from the point of view of both clarity and efficiency .
Up till now , the greatest successes of the Union have been based on the adoption of the Community method .
Asylum seekers must be entitled to have their cases examined on the same basis , irrespective of which country they come from .
It does , however , benefit from having a confident partner with its own vision .
In fact , a short time ago , Martin Schulz had some harsh words to say during the campaign against extremism ; but not only can we speak out about it , we can do something about it too .
Why do we need that proposal at all ?
And then the inevitable happened : Germany and France did not accept the Commission ’ s proposal .
In the same way , some fruit juices are produced by mixing fresh fruit juice and juice made from concentrate .
We are looking forward to the many initiatives that I am sure will be taken in the year ahead .
The question of whether the Ilois people of the Chagos Archipelago would be entitled to British citizenship is a matter between the UK Government and the concerned persons .
The discussions on this agreement have very usefully highlighted the many areas of concern in our relations – concerns that are well reflected in the motion for a resolution currently before Parliament on the situation concerning human rights and democracy in Pakistan .
There can be no question of any lawfully established enterprise in any part of the European Union being closed by the public authorities without its breaking the law .
The report says that children &apos;s rights must be enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty .
Of course , there may well be a few minor flaws but , seeing as the preamble contained an extensive discourse with reference , not least , to Thucydides , I would like to draw the House &apos;s attention to the principle of the ancient Greek philosophers : history is never completely flawless because , if it were , it would not be perpetuated .
At a time when we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome , Europe must show its citizens that it remains for them not just a vehicle for peace and democracy , but above all a vehicle for protecting them against the excesses of all @-@ out liberalism .
Any oil spills which have happened , even in the past , would have a disastrous impact on the environment , causing damage to fishing or tourism as well .
With ALTHEA , we are contributing to the security and stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina , which is important to the reforms in that country .
Bad parking or obstacles on the pavement can still prevent boarding , whilst a simple manual swing @-@ over ramp , built into the floor of each new bus , is cheap and will work time after time .
His description is correct and the Commission agrees completely .
We are making it - here in this place with so little commercial experience amongst our Members - almost impossible for small businesses to employ young women , which is something they want to do .
Indeed , that is the essence of the Barcelona Process .
Thus , 9 @-@ 10 months ago , Helsinki set a procedure in motion , essentially with an eye to resolving the problem which we call Turkey .
A lack of border controls may lead to many negative phenomena associated with criminality and illegal immigration .
Cooperation , however , must not end there .
I should like to have the assurance that that will be the case in the new Commission too .
Indeed , it is not equitable to abide by the negative growth of 2.4 % for the administrative expenses of the Commission alone , as this is the result of rising expenditure due to the redemption of pension rights accruing under institutional arrangements , but charged to Commission services .
This involves , , an increase in Eurojust ’ s operating appropriations and the inclusion of a pilot project in the budget intended to enhance coordination , throughout the EU , of the resources and activities for preventing and combating terrorist threats .
For example , this week the Fisheries Council is debating cod stocks and the common fisheries policy .
It is an important focus of the Irish presidency .
Personally , I cannot see the need for such a note , but I would like the Bank to investigate this in view of confidence in the currency .
Now we have a stability instrument for post @-@ crisis development .
You were given responsibility for launching the euro in coin of the realm .
I would like to remind you that we are not debating Turkey today , but are engaged in the debate on enlargement , and , although Turkey has had candidate status since 1999 , it is not one of the countries expecting to accede in the immediate future .
Despite housing only 7 % of the population of Cyprus , it accounted for over 10 % of the total industrial employment and production of Cyprus .
I very much regret the decision not to grant my request .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am very honoured to be speaking to you today , as I think that the Council , the Commission and Parliament will all have to take important decisions on the subject that we are discussing .

I know that Mrs Wallström and Mrs Wallis , Vice @-@ President of the European Parliament , put forward an interesting initiative and included us other leading women in Parliament and the Commission in the process .
Firstly , we are not judging Ireland against any other country .
( The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m. )
With the communitarisation of its money , Europe has also opted for an autonomous path into the future and , in close association with our transatlantic partners , for an autonomous role in tomorrow &apos;s world .
Even when the Council acknowledges the need to present a declaration on services of general interest , it postpones drawing up such a document until the next Competition Council , thereby forcing these services to obey the rules of competition , which is not acceptable because this heightens social inequalities .
There was also agreement that territorial employment pacts should reflect the institutions and traditions of different Member States .
I find it unacceptable that the European Union ’ s High Representative has not yet had anything to say about Guantanamo ; that is something we cannot tolerate .
It is regrettable that the Member States did not want that .
In this way , we could continue along the same lines as our vote in Parliament in January and , at the same time , ensure greater security for our livestock farmers , that is , if the Council and the Commission have the good sense to support us .
This is a monitoring procedure which the Commission &apos; s report reserved exclusively for the 14 priority projects established at Essen which , as we know , are not the only ones on the list .
It would indeed be a great step forward for Europe if citizens in my country , Austria , as well as in Germany and in other countries , only had to pay the same amount for pharmaceuticals as their fellow citizens in other EU Member States .
Let me tell you , then , Mrs de Palacio , Mr Coelho , that we want to see firm negotiation .
However experience in countries that have implemented lobbying legislation shows that this should only be one part of a broader range of guidelines and measures .
Under our current organisation of the market , we have a commitment to guarantee a specific price for skimmed milk powder and butter .
Finally , the UK Consumers ’ Association published its own report into these issues , concluding that there was a genuine consumer problem and that the cause of that problem lay in the manner in which the English Football Association Premier League jointly sold the rights to Premier League games .
We need to be very careful not to behave like ostriches on the question of language and ensure that we concentrate on a core language so our people really can achieve that flexibility across the whole of Europe .
I think we have reached some important agreements on principles ; now there are a few points to be finalised .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I thank the Commissioner for the comprehensive and exhaustive speech she made , effectively explaining what has already happened in this area .
He believed that any political system that could give Europe a hope of avoiding just three or four wars in a century would deserve the very greatest respect .
In contrast , non @-@ governmental and non @-@ profit @-@ making organisations in post @-@ communist countries introduced voluntary activities only after the democracies had been installed .

But just as we declined yesterday to talk again about Turkey , so we shall not always be able to give our approval to this resolution . Because , if you demand in recital G an open and continuous dialogue with China about this question , then it makes no sense to pass a resolution against China at every sitting of this House .
In view of this , we must ask ourselves : why is it that , faced with the worsening economic situation , we are not at least using the funds provided in the multiannual financial framework ?
I will now conclude , Mr President .
in writing . - ( SV ) Junilistan considers that the EU is a union of values and should therefore play a role in promoting democracy and human rights in its neighbourhood .
Although these states are not yet Members of the European Union , they are all members of the European family .
Though I commend the rapporteur for the work she has put into this report , I have to disagree with her . We should be advocating fairness - equitas - a principle which dates from the earliest days of Roman law .
The question that is being asked is &apos; What can Europe do for me ? &apos; . I think it is important that we make health care available if it is not available in the home country .
In the past , there have been hundreds of cases of Members who have made a mistake in voting , have had it recorded in the Minutes that they have made a mistake , without it changing the result of a vote .
There is an interinstitutional framework agreement for parliamentary access .
We join with the rest of the European Union in calling upon the rebel movements themselves to declare an end to the killings and banditry that sully their cause .
I welcome the proposal for a recommendation of the Commission on joint programming of research in the area of neurodegenerative diseases .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Schulz , I understand your anger that a group , albeit one modest in size , has been set up on this occasion .
Secondly , we were by no means able there to confirm and clarify decision @-@ making conventions in the European Union .
I note in today &apos;s votes that , again , all the votes are roll @-@ call votes .
I have heard this in a different way .
In this context , the Council welcomes and strongly supports the resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly at its 60th session in September 2005 , which emphasises the role of both formal and informal education in the achievement of poverty eradication and other Millennium Development Goals .
We can change fear into productive awareness and care .
Secondly , I will address the formation of these monopolies and the fight against cartels .
If we wait until January to come up with a very searching , very balanced and very detailed response , we will find that nobody is listening any more .
Internally we have just changed the rules on the so @-@ called &apos; career development reviews &apos; .
Madam President , it would be true to say that August 2005 was a black month for civil aviation , and it is a good thing that we are again giving our attention to air safety . The Member who has not been following the debate has to be told that – as the Commissioner said – Europe is not reinventing the wheel .
( Applause )
This is a crucial change in comparison with earlier reports . It is a result of reform and simplification of the CAP .
In Spain , a policy of full recuperation of water costs would clearly not have the same effect as in the countries of the centre and north of Europe .
Its strength in peace , freedom , democracy and the rule of law was the force that attracted these countries , so that they ultimately became Member States .
I would like to finish off by saying , as some fellow Members have already pointed out , that our political persuasion is really not relevant in this case .
There are , however , two points I should like to make .
With China , we know that it does not respond to health and safety concerns , but it does respond to economic threats .
I do not know whether or not it conflicts with Article 1 of Annex 2 , which governs the reimbursement of duly substantiated expenses , but in any event it deals with the same subject .
The debates will be resumed this evening at 9 p.m.
It is well @-@ known that the investment services directive is the bedrock of the EU legislative framework in the field of securities markets .
Strictly speaking , it could be said that , in political terms , Mediterranean policy should today be the main priority of European Union foreign policy .
You said the rising GDP is also a sign that we are on the right track , that the Lisbon Strategy is the right one .
As Vice @-@ Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , I should have liked the language to have been clearer .
If members of the public know where money is being spent they can act as our ears and eyes .
The US government has halted the transport of nuclear materials , and the EU government should also immediately halt the transport of nuclear materials , including MOX fuels .
The participation of women in scientific research within the EU continues to be too fragmented .
I think that the way in which the staffing discussion has been conducted is not good for the future credibility of the independence of the European central bank , and I hope that before the end of the year a solution may still be given in this area , so to speak as a Christmas present for monetary peace .
That does not require any special justification here in Parliament , given that no @-@ one except Parliament need defend its budget rights .
The Council , in its own draft budget , has cut EUR 8 billion from the payment requirements put forward by the Member States .
The French Government has used all possible means to try to make progress on a question which is not its direct responsibility , but that of a company , as I would repeat .
It also signals respect for the European Union &apos;s fundamental treaties .
On &apos; Legislative procedure and planning : mutual cooperation &apos; it includes improving the involvement of Parliament , the review of all pending proposals at the beginning of a new Commission &apos;s term of office , taking due account of the views of the Parliament , and the commitment by the Commission to report on the concrete follow @-@ up to any legislative initiative requests pursuant to Article 225 TFEU .
Today , 21 Member States have not yet fulfilled their promise to provide 0.7 % of gross domestic product in development aid .
Over the last five years , growth in Denmark has been twice as great : 20 % instead of 10 % , and the rate of unemployment has been halved .
We know that he did not initiate the SIS project ; he inherited it when he accepted a change of portfolio at the request of President Barroso .
In Europe there is the Brussels @-@ based European Committee for Standardization ( CEN ) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization ( Cenelec ) , which is also based in Brussels .
The amount now approved , however , is clearly insufficient given the costs of the direct damages , more than EUR 1.3 billion , and , in particular , given the total costs of the eligible damages , around EUR 104.3 million .
This is part of the much bigger picture .
This ban unfortunately makes it clear that the Turkish Government authorities continue to keep this debate shrouded in complete obscurity and entirely outside the law .
It goes without saying that this must be brought about in a democratic manner , but what I ask myself is when is something at last to be done ?
It is quite clear that the Committee on Development and Cooperation is content with the operations under the European initiative for democracy and human rights and it is understandable that two @-@ thirds of the money should now be released for next year .
At the moment , Parliament is working hard on the Sixth Framework Programme , in which the participation of SMEs must be guaranteed at the same - or , ideally , a higher - level .
What matters in the first place is that some sort of stable balance be established between the ethnic groups , with it being ensured that all of them participate in political life and are represented in the armed forces , in the administration and , as the amendment so rightly puts it , in the justice system above all .
They were children who , between 1936 and 1939 , fled Spain , the fascist bombardments , who were evacuated and who found solidarity and care in families in Belgium and the United Kingdom .
- ( EL ) Madam President , Commissioner , we all agree that Copenhagen must be crowned with success , because both the credibility of the political world and the survival of future generations are at stake .
Ladies and gentlemen , we can ensure that labour law is protected by deleting Articles 24 and 25 .
It at least indicates that in Greenland waters we do not have the vast abundance of fish that was once indicated .
I would like to underline that an ambitious approach in the decision @-@ making process depends on the political willingness of Member States .
Many evoke the crisis of 1929 , although the Second World War that followed in its wake divided Europe between two different paths .
The PPE @-@ DE Group supports the differentiated approach .
Trade agreements must not be misused in order to curtail the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals .
Too often , the majority populations of the EU Member States now wish to ignore their regional and national linguistic minorities .
We welcome the release of democracy activist Saad Ibrahim and share the satisfaction of all true friends of Egypt that this long @-@ running saga is over .
( NL ) I should like to congratulate Commissioner Barnier on his appointment as Member of the Commission , and also to warmly welcome him here , as there is a great deal on the agenda .
The situation in Eastern Europe is also far from reassuring .
This is why , based on the amendments proposed , I have called on the Commission to examine the possibility of creating certain intervention mechanisms at Community level , independently of any specific aid granted for crop insurance , to prevent and combat the effects of global warming .
It is the European Union &apos;s general attitude on Albania which is wrong .
Certain areas need special protection from noise and other emissions , and this option must exist .
Let me explain how I have followed up the action in my area of competence .
The Commission proposal is not consistent with this ; quite the contrary , in fact - it even appears to contradict this gas directive .
People marched in their tens of thousands today to oppose this , but we put governments on notice : the struggle will be at its most intense at national level .
Thanks to the economic absurdities of this place , as well as of national government , we cannot rely on the generational support system any longer .
To that extent it was already topical in 2008 and what was said is particularly unfortunate .
Our legal status is therefore international rather than constitutional .
It is a phenomenon which will cause much greater changes than the very creation of the EU and the progress we have seen during its construction .
Jonas Burgos is one of hundreds of people who have disappeared or been killed in the Philippines .
It has at its heart the ideal of free trade contributing to poverty reduction in the world .
President Barroso said earlier , &apos; If it ain &apos;t broke , don &apos;t fix it &apos; .
The most obvious discussion relates to the inflation criterion .
For example , EU citizenship is impossible to renounce .
Her tragic disappearance also , and above all , reflects a profound unease in our societies with regard to the countless nationals of third countries who , wanting to escape poverty , persecution , violence or violations of their rights , often do not find the legal means to do so .
This amounts to saying – and this is my fifth and final point – that the road to a reduction in customs duties is a dead end that should be consigned to the past .
Anyone who is familiar with the Treaty and the complex nature of our relations will be aware how difficult it is to coordinate these various institutions even to some extent .
We put our cards on the table and said , excuse me , but we have a contribution to make to this procedure .
Mr President , I welcome the statement by the President @-@ in @-@ Office .
I hope the Minister does not believe the sanctimonious claptrap he read this House .
. Mr President , this debate comes at a critical stage in Iraq ’ s political transition .
7 .
It is time we mustered the courage to say this , certainly now Prime Minister Erdogan has been arrogant enough to seek to impose restrictions on the free expression of opinion .
Thanks to the support of those good people , leaders such as Havel , Walesa and Čarnogurský were prepared for the fall of communism .
We voted today for greater clarification of competition rules and greater legal certainty , in order that maximum benefit can be derived from all the measures that have been taken to improve the effectiveness , transparency and consistency of this policy .
It is a step towards the unification of criminal law and , at the same time , it is a new step which leads to equality in the eyes of the law between citizens of the Member States , wherever they may be within the territory of the European Union .
Once the people of Zimbabwe have their freedom restored , and genuine democracy and the rule of law established , I feel sure that the international community , including the EU , stands ready to come forward with generous assistance .
I too , as a Member of Parliament and as a European citizen , expect to obtain full access to all the correspondence that has taken place with France and possibly other Member States .
Regarding the first issue , I would like to point out that Russia is still using the supply of raw materials we use to produce energy as a political tool to influence both European Union Member States and third countries .
. Air transport is the most commonly used method of long distance travel , and this has had a serious environmental impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions .
So , I think we have made progress on those issues .
Many people coexist there .
The people of Europe can do without higher defence budgets .
But perhaps one of the most crucial issues is the whole area of the food chain .
Mr President , I should like to tell Mr Colom i Naval that I do indeed know how to lose . But that is not by any means my problem at the moment , because we will certainly know one way or the other on Thursday .
Citizens of the Member State concerned must have a guarantee that their cases will be referred to the highest level and that this will result in a decision .
I am tempted to tell the European citizens affected by the LRAU that we have heard them , that we are appalled by the situation and that we are here not to judge , but to try to bring pressure to bear to ensure that they are all listened to and respected , and that , in the end , a fair and balanced solution will be found .
Foodstuffs are not products on which one can speculate on markets disconnected from any form of reality .
It is therefore impossible for poorer countries to increase spending on health without external assistance , as was also noted by Mr Goerens .
They must enjoy increased access to EU funding , financial engineering instruments and other credit sources .
I do not share the opinion of Mrs Trüpel that we have given way - quite the opposite !
One area is competitiveness , which includes the research and development framework programmes , even though this was regarded as a priority until now .
It expresses a major responsibility and a strong commitment for this House and our communities .
Creativity and culture are values of the European Union which we have strengthened and have to maintain .
Circumventing these merely by subdividing projects into stages , into sections or tranches , is not possible .
At the IMF , Mr Strauss @-@ Kahn alone is not a guarantee of a sensible policy .
I should also like to express my respect , however , for those who do smoke , and to defend their right to smoke .
We trust , however , that it will develop into a cooperation partnership , free from the fetters of the past , which may be read as a reference to colonialism .
This also means that I can see two developments in this field , which cause me some concern .
Opinions may differ on this , and I think that we should have a different starting point .
But how much more credible would words such as democracy and the interest of the people have been if those people had actually been represented .
The crisis management fund does not need additional resources , but it does need to be outside the operational programmes , otherwise there will be total confusion .
At all events , Mr President , I would like to say here that we do not understand and cannot grasp the reason for the rejection of certain amendments , when we note , and I say this with all due respect , a certain lack of consistency .
At the same time we have to consider even at this point what we really want to achieve in terms of a common energy policy and a shopping list like the one the Commission has proposed and which Parliament will probably extend tomorrow does nobody any service .
There are significant differences in the development of our regions , but if we look into it more deeply there are even greater chasms between individual areas within the regions .
In the perspective of the positions set out by Mr Nordmann , these seem to me to be extremely correct .
As I know the area better than Mr Hory - I have been in it constantly for seven or eight years - I have long been afraid that the dead quiet existing in Kosovo is about to come to a very bloody end .
It is that too , but it is above all the unquestionable crisis of a liberalist idea : not to formulate an alternative idea of Europe would truly be unforgivable .
They also take no account of the fact that the European Employment Strategy defined in November 1997 , included in the Lisbon Strategy as defined by the Council in March 2000 , has been the main instrument to promote the flexibility , adaptability and mobility of the workforce , wage adjustment and changes in wage composition , and the opening up to private interests of the bulk of social security services , including pensions and health , which had a negative impact on the quality and security of the jobs created , on workers ’ rights and on income distribution , as well as on the general level of productivity .
The second point relates to the agricultural sector .
Until now that openness has been missing .
Keeping these birds in a humane way , appropriate for the species , involves letting them fly every day .
Any preparations which can be completed today will mean less worry and stress tomorrow and will make the whole project that much safer .
We believe it would take ambitious proposals at the European level for us to make any headway in international negotiations on any issue , including external protection .
The German health services sector will profit from cross @-@ border patient mobility , if patients from other EU Member States make greater use of our high standard of medical services , for example in rehabilitation .
That is the debate , and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference , its agenda or its method .
To those , like me , who are retiring , I wish fulfilment .
The politicians in Europe had better be careful about using this crisis for their own political ends .
The fate of Russia and that of the rest of Europe have been interwoven for centuries .
I am also pleased that things have been kept in balance , for we are in fact going back to the years 2004 to 2006 as the reference date for the allocation of certificates , but we have been very reasonable in setting the cap at 97 % and 95 % and by initially allocating 85 % of the certificates free of charge , with only 15 % to be put to auction .
We are now beginning to discuss the proposal for a European food authority .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Roche , I should like to begin by thanking Mrs Boumediene @-@ Thiery for her good work on an important report .
Mr President , the ELDR Group would like most sincerely to congratulate Mrs Hermange on her report and on the unanimity that it achieved in committee .
I would like to add to the list of this presidency &apos;s practical achievements , which have not already been mentioned , the European Institute of Technology project adopted in Lahti .
We only just managed to prevent the election of Belarus .
The Union has always emphasised the importance of complementarity between European action and Alliance action , especially in relation to the Petersberg tasks .
With the three reports under discussion today , the European Parliament is giving a very strong indication of how it means to achieve these objectives and guarantee security .
What we are talking about is employment . I would like to emphasise that aid should be given during periods of restructuring , and that it should always be temporary .
In the first place , I am pleased that not only representatives from candidate countries for the Eurozone and the rapporteur , but also my German fellow Member , Mr Schwab , noticed the problem that the understanding of the reference country with regard to the inflation criterion for admission to the Eurozone - that is , all Member States - is different to the one we use in setting the ECB target , which implicitly applies to the 13 Member States .
Despite recent reports of unrest and disturbances because of the current electoral process , I believe that this African nation will be able to recover its stability with European Union support .
That brings me to the vodka compromise .
It is clear that this is not the time for a false crisis .
We are getting closer to the opening of the world trade negotiations in Seattle and we urgently need the support of the public to be able to go forward with globalisation .
I think that the Council &apos; s proposal is acceptable because an evaluation will take place within four or five years .
This state of affairs , already unsustainable , may well get even worse after enlargement in 2004 .
The debate is closed .
I then found out that this was an agreement by the two large groups .
I believe that problems of this kind should always be viewed from the standpoint of the common good - the defence of local communities and of the public interest .
If one talks of the Lisbon Strategy , one must also refer to the Commission &apos;s White Paper on Financial Services Policy ( 2005 @-@ 2010 ) , which relies on the integration of the European financial services market into the global financial services market and on the corresponding articles of the Treaties of Nice and Lisbon which , on the one hand , prohibit any form of restriction on the free flow of capital and , on the other hand , are pushing the financial institutions into putting an unobstructed flow of financial services in place .
For this reason , I hope that tomorrow &apos;s vote will show that the compromise that has been sought is supported by Parliament .
I join Sophie in &apos; t Veld in calling for an EU road map to combat homophobia and discrimination and I call on everyone across the political spectrum in this House to unite in support of the whole range of human rights .
Unfortunately , the offers in financial services on the table so far are mostly disappointing .
( PL ) Madam President , a debate on the energy package for the internal electricity and gas market is very much needed .
We abhor Taliban misogyny but say nothing about the rapes carried out by the so @-@ called Northern Alliance - a highly dubious alliance - on a massive scale .
Our question is this : where is the European Dot @-@ Force - similar to the agreement adopted at the G8 Summit - to promote the developing countries &apos; access to global communications ?
I do not believe that the compromise agreed with the Council in this respect is adequate .
( DE ) Then paragraph 11 will stay as it was .
We ask only one thing and that is that this House should set things right itself .
The signals coming from the Council are , however , conflicting and hypocritical and help weaken the international struggle to get the Chinese régime to change its policy .
There are important items on the agenda for this and our group hopes that they will receive due attention .
However , we were always aware of the difficulties that needed to be overcome , not only because they required significant financial resources - it should be remembered that the ESFRI roadmap identifies 44 projects that should be implemented in the next ten years - but also due to the technical and organisational complexity of the issue .
Madam President , I should like to take up the point which has just been made by the previous speaker .
As would seem logical , I informed you about the Commission &apos;s legal opinion in my reply .
Thirdly , they secure for the European Union more favourable treatment than Israel has hitherto accorded other third countries , by offering further economic opportunities to European suppliers .
The broad outlines of the approach recommended by the Commission for the continuation of SIS II were accepted .
In fact , where Member States used to decide how to organise their access agreements with companies themselves , now only the market will decide .
That relates to controls on Community funds .
I hope this will provide a new stimulus to intensify action against human trafficking .
Therefore , since the EPLA is a body of autonomous jurisdictions blocking and holding up the implementation of the European patent , we reject the EPLA and we advise you …
It is best if we simply do not buy these products .
That is what many of us believe in , and for that reason we are very happy to support the presidency and wish it success .
In other words , nothing is agreed until everything is agreed .
One aspect particularly close to my heart is the construction of trans @-@ European networks .
A few suggestions that may be included in such a strategy are , for example , that the Council could develop its own human rights indicators that could be used in connection with trade agreements .
Despite these new objectives , however , the reform proposed by the Commission would cause serious problems for Europe ’ s farmers , not least the swingeing reduction in the price of sugar .
We need to acknowledge that all these fine objectives will demand that we support the supply side in developing countries , because they simply will not have the capacity to deal with these fine objectives .
The report considers the painful consequences for small and medium @-@ sized farms to be a success .
In 2002 the Council decided to introduce restrictive measures against Zimbabwe &apos;s leaders declaring that , as long as human rights continued to be violated the Council would deem it necessary to maintain restrictive measures against the Zimbabwe Government and against those responsible for such violations , and for infringement of the right to freedom of opinion , association and peaceful assembly .
Europe is clearly experiencing a demographic crisis .
Unlike Mrs Cederschiöld , I think it important – and that was also subject of the debate that was held earlier this evening – that enterprises should not simply be the property of shareholders .
. Mr President , I would like to join Minister Schmit in congratulating Parliament on taking the initiative to hold this debate .
First lesson : our agriculture , with all frontiers open , is in danger of sliding down the slippery slope of levelling down , whereas , in accordance with the spirit of Article 100a , we should set a high standard of quality for ourselves .
The Green movement must feel our support , as the opposition is once again looking for options for how to organise legitimate protests against the Iranian authorities at the risk of their own lives .
But it is unfair to expect ACP countries to make long @-@ term decisions on liberalisation and regional integration without having a long @-@ term view of the amount of assistance that would be available to help them put together the regional regulatory frameworks to instigate new methods of collecting government revenues to make up for the loss of the tariff income or to construct a type of infrastructure which we know from our own experience in the EU is so important to developing our regional economy .
The actions about to begin are designed not simply to eradicate terrorism , but also to eradicate an evil regime .
Eight and a half years it has taken you to get this treaty through , and on 1 December you will have it .
B4 @-@ 0762 / 97 by Mr Dell &apos;Alba and others , on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance , on the situation in Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina ; -B4 @-@ 0765 / 97 by Mrs Aelvoet and others , on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament , on the situation in Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina ; -B4 @-@ 0774 / 97 by Mr Swoboda and others , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on the situation in Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina ; -B4 @-@ 0782 / 97 by Mr Cars and Mr Bertens , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democratic and Reformist Party , on the situation in Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina ; -B4 @-@ 0789 / 97 by Mr Oostlander and others , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party , on the situation in Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina ; -B4 @-@ 0791 / 97 by Mrs Pack and Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party , on Sandzak , former Yugoslavia .
There are no common parties with members who have signed themselves up , who voluntarily pay their membership fees and who are involved in the creation of election programmes .
We have endeavoured to produce a text which , to a large extent , extends the 2003 implementation procedures while incorporating the requirements of the new Financial Regulation in terms of sound financial management of public funds .
I think we have to demand a high level of protection against these substances .
Transparency is the basis of our budgeting .
In fact , the Italian Government seems to be practising a gelato caldo , or &apos; hot ice &apos; , strategy .
Some people have proposed switching to a substantial lessening of competition test , a principle used in the United States and in some Member States .
Will it be less or will it be more ?
These are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities , since they must be taken into consideration , under each of the objectives , to different extents in accordance with the specific situations of each of the Member States and regions .
The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions to the Commission :
It would mean that the merchant @-@ based system of licensing and control in Ireland would be allowed to continue .
Those Member States that remain courageous enough during this economic slowdown not to give in to easy solutions and undertake the necessary reforms of employment legislation , social security schemes , and so on , deserve not reprimands but encouragement and incentives for their ability to reform .
The mechanisms for ensuring this already exist in the form of the United Nations and its various agencies .
Today , on the basis of the agreed text , all flights to and from the European Union airports will be fully included in the European Union emissions trading scheme from 2012 .
What sort of situation can this anonymous mass of people be in , if even those who are helping them are harmed in this way ?
Warfare with the aim of averting danger would nullify international law &apos;s prohibition of force , promote political instability and , in the final analysis , shatter the foundations of the whole system of an international community of states.&apos;
I believe that as a democratic body , it is our duty to show particular sensitivity towards any criticism offered in good faith .
It will not : on the contrary , it will result in deflation .
That is indeed reprehensible , given the urgency .
I should like to take advantage of the Commissioner &apos;s presence to ask him if there have been any evaluations on the part of the Commission on the loss of jobs in European aviation companies over the last eight months since the economic crisis broke and , if there are , what measures do you believe could be used to reverse the situation ?
Illegal logging is very often the first step towards the general exploitation of natural forests .
Some of the amendments emphasise the gaining of experience , which forms part of the basic principles of the programme . Some call for greater involvement of the public and NGOs , and then there are some which strengthen the environmental aspects .
Most recently , in September 2001 , Parliament &apos; s Committee on Petitions received a petition signed by me and 17 000 of my compatriots , demanding an overhaul of the illegal tax regime .
I would point out , however , that Question Time to the Council has been removed from the agenda for Wednesday .
Amendment No 35 is already implicit in the text of the proposal and is not necessary .
I would also say in advance that the United States and the EU signed an agreement on large civil aircraft in 1992 . It actually functioned very well until the United States departed from the terms of the agreement by calling upon the WTO Dispute Settlement Body in 2004 .
As a result of this development , particularly in view of the slender budget funds available , cohesion policy , particularly that of the European Regional Development Fund , has focused on economic competitiveness concentrated in the larger urban centres or the most active regions , while the EAFRD is concentrating its resources on improving agricultural competitiveness .
We must stress the importance of the fact that lifelong learning also involves an all @-@ round educational element and not just a professional one .
This also includes the European Court of Auditors and our DG , so there are different layers of control as well .
Mr President , as you all know , the aim of this proposal is to introduce new provisions concerning vehicle fuel tanks made of plastic material , to extend the title and scope of Directive 70 / 221 to include tanks for fuels other than liquid fuels - gaseous fuels , for instance - and to amend the directive adapting it to technical progress so that in future , technical provisions for tanks for all kinds of fuels may be introduced and modified by the committee procedure .
The presidency has many tasks on the international front ; carrying forward the global war on terrorism is the most difficult and the most important .
A small country with just 200 000 citizens , as well as more than 600 000 immigrants .
As part of its preparations , the Commission conducted , between July and October 2007 , a public consultation on the potential SPE .
I also think it is right to make the reform more flexible and progressive , to the benefit of the producers . And I think it is good to be bold when it comes to investigating new uses and varieties of tobacco .
I am delighted , and I thank you that the Committee on Budgets has this week agreed to this transfer .
The Council and Parliament share a common language but I am not quite sure that we yet share a common philosophy .
To do so would send an important message of stabilisation to the entire region , since Croatia &apos;s achievements in both the political and economic spheres are in no respect inferior to those of the next two accession countries .
I am therefore giving it a special mention in the resolution .
The Fourth Directive made great strides in dealing with these problems .
Whether you are talking about our Benito Mussolini , Saddam Hussein or any of the others , the right of peoples has always prevailed over the right of individuals .
Freight traffic in Europe has become a problem due to the enormous increase in the number of lorries on our roads .
We must pool our skills and our resources in external matters , but , in view of the fact that there is still no Constitution , the Commission presented a document a few days ago that contains practical proposals designed to increase the effectiveness , consistency and visibility of the European Union in external matters .
Struggling businesses should also carry on receiving support from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund which should be permanent and have its own budget .
In addition , reference is once again made to Article 152 ( 5 ) of the Treaty which stipulates that &quot; Community action in the field of public health shall fully respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care . &quot;
The European Union has been endeavouring , with the decisive contribution of the European Parliament , to improve the rights of passengers in all transport sectors over recent years .
In addition to our mutual solidarity , the geographical and economical capacity of the Member States must be the primary consideration when dividing up the cost .
I am not saying that a 7 % unemployment rate is not a sufficiently ambitious target , but we do need short term goals so that we can monitor our success .
As regards volume , one might think that we are holding a virtual debate here because , between EUR 22 billion and EUR 24 billion , and allowing for the remaining balances and the under @-@ spend , there is little point , when all is said and done , in fighting for EUR 2 billion that might not be spent .
Well , the Commission &apos;s proposals did not address this issue , and the reason is that nearly all Member States insist that they are not in a position to take commitments in that regard , even though they acknowledge that public financing of aviation security should be permitted .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the planned agreement is in accordance with the longstanding desire of this esteemed House to finally create binding minimum standards and legal rights in respect of data protection with the US .
( IT ) Mr President , Mr Špidla , ladies and gentlemen , I should also like to say how satisfied I am with this important measure .
Finally , Mr President , convergence is not an aim in itself .
That would be sensible .
Mr President , the two reports by Mr Deprez on Europol provide an opportunity for the European Parliament to demand that it be given responsibilities for control over this body .
We have heard the input of all the stakeholders .
Definitely , because we in Italy are not dealing with it .
The coming elections offer no democratic guarantees , so it is up to the European Union to act as a reference point in ensuring that the citizens of Peru and the democratic parties of that country receive those guarantees .
It is claimed that Vietnam is pursuing a reform course .
Fourthly , Member States and the European Commission should develop methods for coordinating the international currency and financial market , which is vulnerable to speculation because it acts spontaneously .
I shall conclude by referring to Goethe , who said that when he read a good book he felt as if he had made a new friend .
Given that El Salvador is one of the countries most afflicted by economic and social difficulties in Central America , it is imperative that the European Union offers a massive level of support in order to tackle the social chaos caused by this natural disaster .
However , it will then also have to be seen what resources are available .
It rightly provides that the Commission can make observations to the Member States for reasons of Community public interest .
However we must also take action to ensure that there are fewer victims in the future .
That is an achievable goal .
I thank the rapporteur for his outstanding report and for the pleasure of working with him .
Both these alternatives have their difficulties .
The directive is not about the working conditions of temporary staff , for those are provided for in the Temporary Employment Directive .
I am ready , on behalf of the Commission , to make a commitment : &quot; The Commission will review the draft regulation amending Regulation 1139 / 98 within one year of its entry into force .
Despite the fact that the budget ’ s heading IV ‘ External and Development Policy ’ faces great financial constraint , I believe that the sums put forward by the Commission are compatible with the financial limit .
This does not mean that they have to be acquired in the same form everywhere in the European Union . It means that we must mutually recognize knowledge of equal value , without a lot of bureaucracy .
Up to 100 sustain mutilations to their hands every day .
In short , we have attained a modest and reasonable budget , which will do no damage to the revenue provided by the Member States .
Mr President , I would like to commend the Commission on its serious and balanced work . Too often , when we broach the subject of immigration , passions , excesses and political ulterior motives prevent us from reflecting objectively and making progress .
It would most certainly be perceived in that way by the population of the European Union .
This is why I want this discussion to be included in the debate on the European Union &apos;s own resources .
Even the European Data Protection Supervisor had to submit his own opinion after he realised he was not consulted .
Citizens are calling for initiatives and sanctions , and for customs controls to be stepped up , to prevent the European CE marking from being improperly exploited .
For the first time , the 2000 @-@ 2006 payments could even be higher than forecast and I anticipate asking for at least EUR 1 billion more in objective 1 appropriations when the overall end @-@ of @-@ year transfer is made .
Can we please have a consistent ruling on this matter ?
All things considered , we hope that the debate and the votes on the amendments will produce a well @-@ balanced resolution .
I believe it is very important , particularly in the light of the Lisbon agenda , that Europe should not leave these new technological developments , this navigation system , to the United States or China but that our aim should be to play our own self @-@ assured role in the world and in the global marketplace .
I have already said that I find this completely acceptable .
It supplements Paragraph 16 and reads : &quot; Favours the convening of a Euro @-@ Mediterranean conference on agriculture , with the participation of representatives of the institutions , members of the agri @-@ foodstuffs industry and representatives of farmers &apos; and consumers &apos; organisations &quot; .
This amendment is aimed at delaying a review of the Eurovignette Directive .
I would like to ask whether the Council might remain for another quarter of an hour or twenty minutes , or is there a trade union for Council presidencies that forbids them from answering questions after seven in the evening ?
That is positive .
- The next item is the report by Mr Florenz on behalf of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change on 2050 : the future begins today - recommendations for the EU &apos;s future integrated policy on climate change .
How do you intend to explain the new cooperation to the governments ?
This is particularly true of the high @-@ tech areas of the sectoral directive , where in order to secure its future as a strong global player , the European Community must remain competitive when markets are opened up .
I should like to ask whether this really is true , and whether all 15 of our Member States can shake hands on it before all the conditions which you have described are fulfilled .
Although this is clearly not the only theme of the report , we must use this explanation of vote to highlight the rapporteur ’ s statement that ‘ abortion must not be regarded as a family planning method ’ , but also her call for ‘ legal and medically safe interventions to be possible ’ .
Furthermore , the EU Parliament has shown that it does not accept secrecy and that it cherishes an open Internet for all .
The Commission actively promotes the principle of religious freedom as part of our dialogue on human rights with the Russian authorities .
When it came to voting either for or against , we abstained .
I therefore believe that the right approach lies not in laying down new laws but in pushing the world of football towards forms of self @-@ regulation that can encompass all those directly concerned - all participants , including football supporters .
The trust and confidence that we assume from our citizens is fading away .
Finally , Madam Vice @-@ President , I would like to ask what is happening about the announced withdrawals of legislative proposals .
( PT ) Madam President , Mr Bertrand , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am very pleased with this report which concludes an issue pending since 2002 .
Nice is not , at heart , about enlargement but about shifting power from electors and elected representatives to officials and ministers .
There are now rules which apply to volatile organic compounds which are released when filling up with fuel , as well as for substances of this kind used in industry .
Given the huge resistance on the part of a number of Member States , it was clear from the outset that the negotiations would be tough .
The fundamental pillar of the new international rules must be the notion of more equal opportunities to be involved in revising the rules as well as playing by them .
I propose that the Commission try to set up a European fund for this purpose with the non @-@ governmental organisations in the social sphere .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I am also very grateful for the atmosphere , the debate and the real openness on this issue .
Under the terms of this text , an increasingly aggressive form of capitalism will become entrenched , society will be structured along neoliberal lines , everything will be commercialised and people will become increasingly devalued .
Of the 189 amendments in the report of the Environment Committee and the 26 tabled in plenary , the Commission is able to accept well over half fully or in principle .
The admission of displaced persons into the European Union has so far been uneven .
Mr President , I should like to pick up on what Mr Harbour said .
A new kind of cooperation is needed .
Amendment No 9 allows each Member State to introduce more favourable provisions than those set down in the directives , and insists that these new rules will not lower current standards of protection .
I voted for the European Parliament resolution on preventing trafficking in human beings as I believe that it is extremely important to step up the battle against human trafficking , which has assumed alarming proportions and constitutes a serious violation of fundamental human rights .
( The President cut the speaker off . )
Mr President , as I follow today &apos;s debate in the House I find myself being reminded of the miracle of the strange enlargement of the loaves .
In this respect , we wish to reiterate our desire to have an annual plenary debate on the subject here in Parliament .
The question initially asked by Mrs Thors did not refer to this special problem , so the Council Secretariat could not provide me with any documentation on this matter .
That is the single largest UN appeal of this year .
However , this Council must play an important role in regulatory harmonisation , bureaucracy reduction and the elimination of barriers to trade - so that our companies can do business more easily in the United States and our markets mesh better with each other .
Our final demand is that no major distortions of competition within European agriculture should be allowed to result in the event of the exemption under Article 58 being chosen .
The headline reads : &apos; &quot; States that reject the Treaty may have to leave the EU &quot; says Prodi &apos; .
If we do , what will the consensus be ?
Not only for industry , but also with regard to health care and food safety .
Meanwhile , no demands have been made of the most highly polluting countries ; on the contrary , China alone has announced that it is going to double its energy production by 2020 and , therefore , since it has decided to stick with 80 % carbon to 20 % other energy sources , it will also double its emissions .
China remains , by and large , the main source of unfair trade ( around 35 % of cases launched by the EU are against China ) .
I know that these elements were all @-@ important to Parliament at first reading and in the committee this time round .
The second @-@ reading compromise consisted , therefore , of appropriate guarantees given for some herbs and spices that exempted them from limits set out in Annex III .
The credibility of the European Union is at stake .
I wish to express my special appreciation for the article on minority rights , which could form the basis and starting point for an EU legal framework for the protection of minorities .
If the Treaty fails in one country , it fails in the entire Union , and that is not in our best interests .
Police cooperation and education as such are not foreseen in the immediate future but that could , of course , be discussed once Ukraine has carried out the necessary reforms .
B5 @-@ 0111 / 2001 , by Mr Van den Berg and Mr Sakellariou , on behalf of the PSE Group , on Chechnya ;
The proposal put forward by the Commission concerning the Mining Waste Directive and published , if I remember rightly , on 2 June concentrates more upon the management of waste .
Let us either create a transparent chapter for wine within agricultural legislation or reject the report .
For example , there is a project on including a message in national passports which would inform the holders that they can ask for consular protection from any other Member State embassy or consulate in a third country , provided their country is not represented there .
We think that every sinner should be allowed to reform rather than being put to death , and so we welcome your conversion .
Secondly , any support mechanism that is considered must be realistic and consistent , but must , above all , fit into a stable and appropriate legal framework if it is to achieve the desired effect .
The goal is to put neo @-@ fascism in a good light and condemn communism .
In a developed Europe , it is important to achieve the target of collecting 85 % of electrical and electronic equipment by 2016 ( according to the draft amendment that I tabled in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and which was adopted ) and recycling between 50 % and 75 % of that .
If shipping companies look at their bookings and find they have fallen , that might lead them to consider bringing their vessels up to the latest standards in order not to lose passengers .
We support the plea regarding the simplification of MEDA &apos;s management procedures and the strengthening of its strategic and integrated approach .
Although the dates by which this directive was to be implemented , a core element in it , presented plenty of difficulties , this issue , too , eventually proved capable of resolution .
Madam President , when you look at the Commission communication on nuclear sector related activities for CEEC and NIS states and at the Court of Auditors &apos; report , you could be forgiven for thinking that they were about two totally different subjects .
The financial contribution is , in total , ECU 1 , 746 , 750 , which is an average of ECU 582 , 250 per annum .
The Heads of State or Government decided unanimously that treaty change is required to establish this mechanism .
Even though she failed to have the European Union Cultural Heritage Label established , the European Heritage Label is still excellent , as is the project itself .
Developing people @-@ to @-@ people contact , as you have already said , is essential for democracy and stability in the region .
I do not think that is inconceivable .
Concerning the amendments tabled for this Parliament , the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 , which will improve the clarity of the text .
I would point out the central role of SMEs in all of this .
We must focus sharply on securing the supply of raw materials to European industry .
The Tampere Council specifically stressed this priority , and I quote : &quot; The European Council stresses the need for more efficient management of migration flows at all their stages .
This European Parliament resolution of 9 June 2011 on misleading business directories warns the Commission of the need to step up its activities regarding the revision and improvement of the directive and other relevant legislation in order to put an end , as soon as possible , to the misleading practices used by publishers of business directories , namely , through the compilation of a specific blacklist of misleading practices used in business directories .
We should continue to pursue the positive initiatives here and use alternative sources of funding to defray the costs of informing the public .
This is the crucial point , and this is an important contribution to the fight against terrorism .
in writing . - ( HU ) According to some people , the crisis in the Caucasus started with President Bush &apos;s speech in Riga in 2005 , when he announced that a new Yalta Agreement was needed .
Every year , the fourth Sunday in November is a day for commemorating this genocide and this mass starvation .
Of the 25 very senior appointments that have been made by this Commission since last September , 4 have been of women officials .
The Commission should clarify this and propose that , in principle , all who have opted for the level of protection intended for professional investors , that is to say , a lighter level of protection , should always be able to benefit from the country of origin system in cross @-@ border services .
Secondly , it is justified by the EU &apos;s own interest in contributing to the financial , social and political stability of our neighbourhood countries as a condition for their development and democratic consolidation , as this is also a prerequisite for our own political stability .
Mr President , I too should like to thank the Commissioner and our rapporteur for their work on this issue .
I suspect that this principle is being seriously violated in the Member States .
The vote will take place on Thursday , 26 March 2009 .
The European Union would thus have a single major piece of legislation to protect one of its essential natural resources .
With this directive we can provide the market with the right key to achieve this .
I shall just give you one example : there is a very recent videogame called Rule of Rose , which is a really serious problem in that the main characters in the game are children , and many of the images are on the borderline of sexual perversion and sadism .
The German deposit system – as most Germans agree – is not an attractive solution .
Our aim is to improve the information of companies about the single market , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises which do not always have all that is needed to obtain the necessary information .
The success and stability of the euro , and not least its acceptance by the citizens of Europe , will depend on a social and ecologically @-@ oriented economic policy .
Total remuneration would be halved while administration costs would rise considerably .
The fundamental condition for Serbia on which this report is based is full cooperation with the tribunal in The Hague in order to progress on the path to EU membership .
There was nothing to report , sadly .
In Turkmenistan , the lack of freedom of expression and of democratic debate , the impossibility of maintaining an effective opposition to the government and the non @-@ existence of any programme of structural reform are major causes for concern .
Yet does this type of report have any real impact ? This is a frequently asked question .
( EL ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I congratulate the rapporteur on her comprehensive and cohesive report , which objectively assesses the progress made in implementing the European Action Plan 2004 @-@ 2010 while at the same time taking note of shortcomings and new data .
Therefore , the European Union should help Moldova and bring about an improvement in the country &apos;s situation in terms of stability , security and prosperity .
I actually agree that we should not simply consider the views of industry .
There is a strong need to consolidate the experience of &apos; A to G &apos; and involve industry , not by force , but by really involving them .
The built environment consumes approximately 40 % of our energy , 99 % of which is accounted for by existing buildings .
The Lifelong Learning programme and the Youth in Action programme are good examples .
But it is equally true that attack is the best form of defence .
I think the question of geographical balance , which is emphasised so often , could have been resolved in a much better way .
We have also adopted all the amendments that could represent progress in relation to the current situation .
Generally speaking , what is known as the Basle Convention appears to be working reasonably well .
There are other reasons for this apart from air traffic control .
We have raised the problem during several meetings with the competent transport ministers .
One of the major problems in this area was that if you do something wrong , especially when it comes to revenue of the European Union , then this will be termed an irregularity in one country and a crime in another .
The civil and military stocks must be declared and placed under the control of Euratom and the IAEA .
One particular problem is the agricultural budget .
The issue of the Balkans - i.e. the former Yugoslavia - is important for the European Union , as is the establishment of a security belt , and economic development on the European Union &apos;s borders is integral to this process .
– Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in the case of the economically backward countries such as Spain , Portugal , Greece and Ireland that joined the Union later , the Union adopted a consistent policy encouraging the development of entrepreneurship and competitiveness .
In recent months , different groups have continuously called for either bringing the discussion forward or postponing it .
Arguments about the threat to the European social model are completely rebutted by the directive adopted almost ten years ago concerning the placement of workers in the services sector .
I do not really understand his reasoning , which seems to me , in any case , to be heading in the wrong direction .
The report describes the current situation and , I regret to remind you , we have 60 million poor people in the European Union , and this is unacceptable .
People should not live in small or big prisons for their thoughts .
Lastly , while I agree with Mr Jarzembowski ’ s idea that the rail package constitutes a whole , and while we all agree on promoting rail transport , and moving forward in this direction , I do not think this necessarily entails liberalisation .
It will be a great relief to be rid of them .
The important message in both those files has been that we , via the codecision procedure , really want to take political decisions in this area , and that it is also important that we ask the Commission , and really insist on this , to present legislative initiatives on which we can decide in codecision with this House and with the Member States and their parliaments .
The European economy has a huge margin for growth ; it is true that the European economy can become more productive , but we need to be bolder in the way we go about it .
They will place their trust and their future in the hands of those leaders and those leaders must respect that trust .
Questions to Commissioner Diamantopoulou
The arrest and forthcoming trial of Mr Öcalan provide an opportunity to demonstrate that even in the most sensitive of trials , Turkey &apos;s judiciary can act in a fair and transparent manner , fulfilling its international obligations .
We need to be capable of establishing types of criminal offence that are not cumbersome , because if the courts consider that there are difficulties , presumption of innocence will always prevail , and we must not waste this opportunity .
But at the same time we must not forget to include in the discussions those players who operate in this market in order to get their view of the problems and to find out about possible solutions .
The same , though , is true for exports , and not just in Germany .
That explains our opposition .
There are three principles that we see as indispensable .
In so doing , we pray that our small action may help restore sanity and dignity to our nation.&apos;
We have often regretted the lack of a strong industrial policy in the European Union .
I address those words to the Council as well .
Do we know enough about the ships travelling along our coasts ?
We are aware of your revolutionary enthusiasm , Mr Pannella .
From this standpoint I think that the existing common organization of the market for olive oil was essentially constructive , despite certain problems , and that we should categorically reject the European Commission proposal for aid per tree .
I realise with deep regret that we have to withdraw our compromise proposal and are thus forced into a conciliation .
In some countries , it is even touching 21 % .
This Green Paper should trigger wide @-@ ranging debate on the subject and maybe lead to a plan of action at European level .
Maybe it will then be a little easier for us , members of the government , to convince our national parliaments of the accuracy of some of our claims when they hear those expressed by their colleagues from other countries , and particularly from developing countries . I welcome this development with open arms .
Thank you , Commissioner .
We must continue along this road .
There is the peer review where we are talking about weeks , then it has to come back after that to the Commission , and there will then be the internal process .
But the World Bank , not exactly known for its anti @-@ American pronouncements , has praised Cuban healthcare and education .
In so doing , you have sent out the right signal at the very outset of your presidency , and that is something of which we Social Democrats are very much in favour .
Mr President , we must not forget Afghanistan .
You could influence those who have the ability to change this . We have the ability to change this .
The fact that fundamental rights have come to be guaranteed under constitutional law over the past 200 years is largely down to the impact these universal documents of fundamental rights have had .
Secondly , we need to avoid exclusive concentration on protecting those still in work at the expense of those who seek it and those employers who seek to provide it .
The EU has adopted the objective of doubling the use of renewable energy resources by 2010 . At present they account for 6 % , and the aim is therefore to attain 12 % .
That is why we need to establish a genuine 28th system , by which I mean an additional , autonomous European protection mechanism to go alongside those available in the national courts .
The security and progress of these countries serve the interests of the EU directly , as this is where the decisive part of the natural gas imports and a significant amount of the electricity imports of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic come from .
The people of Albania have taken up arms because we let them down and did nothing .
To continue , I must stress that it is exceptionally important for the Natura 2000 network to be completed on land and at sea and for effective management and adequate financing of the network .
There is competition between the Member States on labour policy and the standards of the European Social Model which does not contribute to the achievement of the objectives which we say we wish to pursue and the conditions which , in theory , are guaranteed .
The high degree to which the Community &apos; s fishing opportunities are exploited is impressive and worth emphasising .
But they are arrived at by applying the tests of the general clause and must fall within the scope of the proposal .
We must prevent divisions , divisions between the regions of Europe , between the households of Europe and between the individuals of Europe .
However , if I may be so bold , I would like to touch on two or three elements .
The risk is that in the heart of old Europe we are seeing perpetuated the situation that Luigi Sturzo described when he said that in every state all of the citizens are disarmed and only the government is armed .
At present , we are only dealing with food available to the consumer .
Foolishly , we have rejected Amendment No 41 on grape juice , or to be technical , metatartaric acid , which makes it possible to return acidity to grape juice and to improve the flavours of grape juices .
We have had a system for trading emission allowances in Europe since 2005 .
Generally speaking , the countries where companies are at the top of the scale also seem to be the most dynamic .
Copenhagen must also enable developing countries to move in the direction of low @-@ carbon models .
Why is it that our children are overweight ?
Certainly not .
I assure you it is no more popular in my country than it is in any of one of yours .
Nobody believes that !
I therefore believe that we must not isolate Russia , but rather try to establish dialogue and cooperation with her .
I am calling on the European Union to condemn these remarks and raise the matter with China .
rapporteur ( BG ) . - Thank you , Madam President , and thank you for that reminder .
Would different terminology not make application slightly complicated ?
If we want to make headway , then we need to adopt the opinion expressed by the European Parliament at first reading , because it deals more fully with the problem which , as is already quite clear I think , is a particularly acute problem .
On many occasions during this presidency the Council has tried to put pressure on the parties in the Middle East , including Prime Minister Netanyahu to try to persuade them to take action on the issue to which the honourable Member refers and indeed many other issues .
This is an issue which affects aspects of everyday life .
And I stress this because many people are now questioning the wisdom of holding the elections on the date which is planned ; of holding them throughout Bosnia ; of applying the principle of conditionality ; of bringing firm pressure to bear to remove those accused of war crimes from public office , arresting them and bringing them before the International Tribunal in the Hague - something which some people even believe might be considered a provocation .
We urge all those involved to take a step away from the policy of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth and towards one of cooperation , peace and mutual understanding .
However , there is still one fly in the ointment : we wanted certification of toys by independent testing institutes , so that we can also be really sure .
I think there is some muddle .
Energy efficiency programmes have the potential to create jobs .
Since last year ’ s Thessaloniki Summit , the European Union and the countries of the Western Balkans have a shared agenda for progress .
The Reform Treaty promises Parliament a real say on external action for the first time .
We are talking about partners here and partners have mutual respect for each other &apos;s values , views and interests and do not haul the other partner before a WTO court on account of that partner &apos;s values .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal for a directive on the right of EU citizens and their family members to move freely and reside within the territory of the Member States results from the new legal and political state of affairs created by the introduction of citizenship of the European Union .
It would be if he were an employee , but he is an employer , and that makes all the difference .
How I enjoyed your denouncement of Communism as a dangerous ideology - and I noted the pride that you took in the fact that Hungary was the first country to take up arms against the Soviet Union .
Generally speaking , I am very interested in the amendments tabled on the role of the data protection officer , such as Amendment 9 , and those concerning data protection .
This House has always taken the fight against fraud very seriously , more seriously , I would even dare say , than some of the Governments which accuse the Commission of extravagance .
Otherwise , we will not be able to find the right balance to enable us to achieve the objectives of the policies .
Otherwise they could have made the Hennegau a better objective 2 area .
Those are in fact also the ones who scream loudest that the first candidates should become members of the European Union around the year 2000 .
The main points are firstly , the appointment of a terminal representative , secondly , the drawing up of a loading and unloading plan and thirdly , the right of intervention by the competent authorities in the event of a disagreement between ship and shore .
If we fail to include it then the path will be much more difficult .
What does he mean by this , and what can we expect in this regard ?
Thank you .
We have been discussing this package for many months and now there is 98 % agreement with the Council .
I am referring to the fact that government discussions are underway , and six months after they are concluded , we must commence membership negotiations with the Baltic States .
In my view there is no substitute for the quality of beef , lamb and pork produced by European farmers .
There is , however , work to be done ; we have European neighbours that have not fully abolished this practice and it should remain our focus to continue our efforts toward complete abolition .
Of course , more needs to be done in future even in this direction , especially to respond to the request for solidarity voiced by the countries that have just joined the Union .
But - because I myself was a target for the attacks and because it always amuses me , so I remember it clearly - in the early debates the issue really was : are deregulation and liberalization even possible at all , or are they just fantasies conjured up by these ultra @-@ liberals ?
That is saying quite a lot , perhaps , although Russia is on the right track and this is consequently a step towards accession to the World Trade Organisation .
On behalf of our group , we wish to put ourselves firmly alongside those who favour a common European statute for Members of the European Parliament , simply out of respect for the parliamentary office we hold and which our successors will hold after us .
In addition to the rules concerning the European authority that I mentioned previously , the agreement therefore also contains a provision stating that the system must be appraised by an independent appraisal body .
I regret to say that Belarus is the only country in Europe which still applies the death penalty in practice .
It must not be a relic from the Cold War , merely issuing recommendations that do not lead to any measures being taken .
This , however , will undermine the sense of security of other , smaller countries in the future .
This sum amounts to EUR 51 million .
Perhaps we could simply all try it together once more , Mr President .
We have to look forward rather than revert to the old politics of revenge ; I see it as very , very important to stress that .
The Commission must modify its draft agreement text to ensure that European citizens &apos; data protection rights are protected .
In this paragraph , my friend , Mr Catania , who is looking at me at this moment from his seat , states that he calls on the Member States to do all they can to facilitate and improve access by young people , the elderly and the disabled to the labour market .
&lt; empty &gt;
It ought , moreover , to be possible for the Union and the Centre to have a role in supervising the domestic production of drugs , as one of the previous speakers mentioned , for we cannot get away from the fact that many of the drugs that are in circulation today , and which young people encounter on the streets , are synthetic drugs , produced in the Union and nowhere else .
I was not the one who invited Mr Ben Ali to the European Parliament .
I think that the fundamental explanation lies in two figures : between 1991 and 1996 public debt went up from 56 % to 73.5 % of GDP .
Embassies and other vulnerable buildings also received better protection .
I conclude by saying that we are facing the critical decade from the year 2000 to 2010 for the survival of our species .
We call on the Commission and the Council and of course all the Member States to raise these matters in contacts of all kinds with Saudi Arabia .
Mr Janowski explained this particularly eloquently just a few minutes ago .
4 .
There are also some other areas which we want to tackle . These were listed in the letter , which I have mentioned , as set out by the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , and they were also contained in the letter , which your President has just sent to the Council .
Finally I want to thank our colleague , Charlotte Cederschiöld , for the valuable work she has done .
Instead of clearly acknowledging this asset , we put pressure on women to get jobs and go into business .
We should give some thought to the fact that while some of our fellow Members , chiefly from the EPP , worry about whether we will support a certain type of aircraft - I am no military expert and have no idea what this debate is about - then I believe we should pay far more attention to what Mr Arlacchi is talking about in this report , as it is very important .
According to the principle of collegiality which governs the Commission work , all the members of the Commission are jointly responsible for decisions and actions taken .
The issue was brought to a head at the end of 1999 with the expiry of a transitional period for fixing MRLs for established drugs .
Order of business
But this is basically not a Commission issue .
The fishing industry also means safeguarding people &apos;s economic and social living conditions .
If this House is unable either to organise debates so that they keep to time or else that some time is actually left between the vote and the end of the debate , then we really should think about other ways of doing things .
And as you will have noted , the common position includes most of the amendments adopted by the European Parliament at first reading , as Mr Desama reminded us when he said that 80 % of the European Parliament &apos;s amendments had been accepted and are now included in the common position .
However , it does not appear that anything is being done , given the rising crime rate at all levels in Italy , ranging from anti @-@ social behaviour to organised crime , not to mention the steady inflow of illegal immigrants into our country , and above all the fact that some people who come to Italy with study , work or tourist visas are not returning to their own countries when these expire .
In addition , the increasingly ageing population is having a major impact in many Member States , because they do not save as much as the Dutch .
The aim is to achieve a high level of protection based on the actions of the most generous Member States , such as Austria .
I urge the Commissioner , when he goes to this meeting in Accra , to make sure that the European Union is singing off the same hymn sheet .
What matters is getting the mechanisms moving and getting employment moving .
Sooner or later , however , we will have to listen to the people .
We take note of Parliament &apos;s motion for a resolution regarding the individual case of Mr Troy Davis .
They will select the pacts and they will inform the Commission .
Mr President , I am among those who are critical of this report in its present form , and that for several reasons .
In my opinion , what is now happening in Belarus and the kind of actions that Mr Lukashenko has dared allow himself to take when it comes to the Polish minority in this country are signs that he also is looking more to Moscow than to the West .
I am delighted that the European Parliament has drawn significant attention to the fact that we must facilitate the integration of people with disabilities in the areas of education and training .
It was the Cotonou Agreement that first acknowledged that corruption was an obstacle to development .
Some amendments , Mr President , offer a glimmer of comfort , but apart from Amendment No 5 they are all theoretical .
This underestimate is made deliberately .
Mr President , ideally GMOs should not be released into the environment .
Cooperation on problems extending beyond national borders is one of the great added values of the work carried out by the European Union .
I hope it will be sustainable .
Mr President , Commissioner , Andalusia is one of the most tolerant and multiracial regions of the European Union .
I congratulate Mr Diamandouros on his worthy representation and effective conduct of the role of defender of transparency and honest administration in the European Union .
The main problem was with extending article 113 &apos;s area of application so as , if need be , to clear up any ambiguities that might exist as to the respective jurisdiction of the Union and the Member States , and to place the Union in a position to speak in unison at the negotiations of international organizations .
On the other hand , the option is given to any European institution or to any Member State voluntarily to receive opinions from the Agency , with the competences of the different parties being taken into account .
Once again , the Commission is very clearly concerned about the need to make the solidarity fund faster and expand its scope .
For example , unemployment is very high in Réunion and in the West Indies . Therefore , we should not devote our efforts to integrating unlimited numbers of immigrants .
At the same time , flames continued to devastate the districts of Aveiro , Bragança , Guarda , Leiria , Santarém and Viseu .
The European Union and twelve Mediterranean countries were consequently pleased to adopt the famous Barcelona Declaration in 1995 .
Do you understand what we are facing ? We really are facing the future of a structure that must be as international as possible .
I make no apology for having loyally worked alongside these Heads of State or Government .
The simple agreements between Member States promoted by the Council are therefore inadequate .
We need to share experience .
I hope the Commission is prepared to respond on this point .
I congratulate the Presidency @-@ in @-@ Office on the success of Barcelona . Congratulations are also due to the Spanish Government .
At international level , too , Europe is the right level for action .
It must be obvious at the moment that the best thing is for them to work together with us to maintain peace in Europe .
Some inconsistencies were found , though these were due to the fact that the Joint Undertaking concerned is still in its start @-@ up phase .
In our opinion , the decisions adopted at the Bali Conference are appropriate .
I would remind you , too , that the regulation will include a minimum core of rights that will apply , without exemptions , from the moment that it comes into force .
I would suggest that the price of a stable Iraq exerting a benign influence regionally and nationally is worth every effort to attain .
A passive attitude will do nothing to encourage growth .
Two days ago Mr Aznar told Mr Sharon that the Palestinian conflict could only be solved by political means under the premises of the mutual recognition of the States of Palestine and Israel .
Mr President , the debt crisis in Greece has raised questions about our ability to maintain the stability of the euro area .
The island regions also need the progress of the information society for their qualitative growth and progress with renewable energy sources to make them less dependent on traditional energy sources .
The Council , Commission and Parliament should all share responsibility for this .
The vote on the three reports will take place today at 12 : 30 .
The most important issue , as you , Taoiseach , and every other speaker emphasised , is the draft Constitution .
The truth is that the whole of society suffers as a result of mental health problems .
I would also like to thank the two rapporteurs , Mr Surján and Mr Maňka , for their constructive cooperation and express my gratitude to my colleagues in the Ecofin Council .
I hope that is the idea of us meeting here and both putting together what we are proud of in the history of the European Union , and formulating our hopes for the next 50 years of European cooperation and integration .
Let us simply clear everyone out of the buildings , lock the door , throw away the key and give that EUR 1.7 billion back to the citizens who have earned it with their own blood , sweat and tears .
Let me tell you that I know that Parliament is a directly elected body - after all , I was also a Member ; but there are legitimate leaders , ministers , in the Council as well .
As for the fund , there has been a significant amount of financing .
The report calls for a stronger UCLAF to be set up as a matter of urgency to tackle this problem and also demands the establishment of a new institution - call it what you will - and the name European public prosecutor perhaps gives the wrong impression here .
A terrorist is a man or woman or , alas , a deluded child who sets out in the morning to murder innocent men , women and children to make a political point - the propaganda of the deed .
As Mr Coleman of DG SANCO stated in a letter he wrote shortly after that : &apos; A clear majority of experts from the Member States have expressed the position in both the Commission and the Council working parties that the reduction to 350 mg / l is not sufficient , and wish to go further.&apos;
I do not therefore see how we can possibly understand this , if the logic of your energy policy is supposed to be fair , treating all forms of electricity production alike .
The euro is used in the financial markets , in the debt markets and in the capital and money markets at world level to a degree that is disproportionate to the relative weight of the eurozone ’ s economy within the world economy .
However , the majority of the Irish continue to acknowledge and fully appreciate our EU membership , particularly at this time of unprecedented global economic difficulty , when marginalisation and loss of influence cannot be an option for us and when unfettered access to the single market of 500 million consumers is critical for Irish exports - including our delicious pig meat by the way - so we can trade our way back into growth .
Nevertheless , these efforts do not appear to be sufficient , since the parallel constantly increasing demand in this sector almost cancels them out .
Why are you doing this ?
The crisis is a structural one , and has not been caused merely by current circumstances , as you have said , but by the successive deregulations .
This is not a question of instruments for the communitarisation of debts , as would be the case with Eurobonds .
( NL ) Madam President , I was one of the MEPs who voted in favour of Turkey prior to the opening of the negotiations , and to my mind , these negotiations are , in reality , an exercise in conflict prevention .

Firstly , I welcome paragraph 6 and Mr Monti &apos;s remarks that we should move away from hard infrastructure towards soft infrastructure .
The law does not prohibit homosexual acts , only &quot; habitual debauchery &quot; , of which there was scant evidence .
There would also be the question of the public authorities interfering in the work of such an agency .
In view of the negative effects of the fluorinated greenhouse gases in air @-@ conditioning , I would like to call for them to be phased out as soon as possible .
Financial incentives in this area have in the past produced positive results .
in writing . - ( EL ) The report uses the existing problem of organised crime as a pretext to promote a harsher policy to restrict fundamental individual rights and strengthen the police state and the uncontrolled action of the repressive mechanisms of the ΕU .
Why have we got into such a situation ?
Our expectations change , but it is vital that we keep up with these changes in our thinking and our policy making .
The Commission is , therefore , seeking to better clarify these criteria with the American authorities , in order to prevent future cases of false positives .
Few people are aware of the impact of budget policy decisions on women in economic , social , and societal terms .
That is why I would ask the Commission whether it is prepared to bring pressure to bear on the Netherlands to grant legal support to Ivory Coast and also to ensure that , in consultation with the UN , an emergency fund is set up for the victims of this disaster .
This is something that all these regions have asked for .
However , as we can all see , this is going to be far from simple .

In my opinion , the European Central Bank should cut the interest rate tomorrow by one percentage point .
The method for meeting the necessary accession criteria , especially those coming under Chapter 23 , justice and fundamental rights , marks an important milestone in this country &apos;s progress in achieving European standards .
Finally , it is essential to note that important safeguards are built into the system of delegated acts , such as the possibility of objection by the two colegislators , Parliament and Council , with respect to specific acts adopted by the Commission under its delegated powers and the possibility of completely withdrawing the delegation if they are not satisfied with the way in which these powers are used by the Commission .
All of these events and problems have one common thread : no European country , not even the very biggest , can handle such problems alone .
. I welcome the Estrela report .
In this regard , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs Gill , my dear friends here today , I strongly recommend that , tomorrow , we adopt the amendment concerning precisely these new technologies , which we in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance tabled together with Mrs Buitenweg and which was adopted by a narrow majority in committee .
But no matter how many people we appoint to OLAF , fraud is , at best , only going to be slightly reduced .
Our main objective is to obtain , in the short term , an exclusion and / or compensation package , which may mean further time will need to be spent at the negotiating table , and we shall , as agreed with the Council , report back before 19 July on the progress made on this issue .
We are not able , as of now , to say how many kilometres of roadway we built last year .
It has now transpired that Indonesia , Vietnam and possibly China , have probably waited many months before informing the OIE .
We did not meet the Prime Ministers of Malaysia or Singapore as they were both away but we met the Foreign Ministers and we were very well received .
We thank the Commission for tackling those complex issues we did not at first expect .
No .
He was Prime Minister when Britain joined the European Community in 1973 and since then he has been an unswerving advocate of a strong and effective European Union .
The lords of the EU have decided to usurp the budgetary powers of the Member States and they have done this not in the name of solidarity , which is a concept that is increasingly alien to them , but in the name of the stability that the great powers demand for the euro ; this is an intolerable affront to democracy and the sovereignty of the peoples .
We therefore propose that Annex VI , XX ( Powers and responsibilities of standing committees ) should be clarified and that relations with the European Ombudsman should be included among the responsibilities of the Committee on Petitions .
One point in the conclusions addresses the upcoming WTO negotiations , and I concur with that stated .
If , in the Treaties , the Commission has been granted the right of initiative , it is because it has to represent the general interest .

Taking driving as an example , we cannot hope to influence driving practices in Sicily or Finland from Brussels .
I should like to refer to the general report which occupied us in two sittings last year .
In particular I support the call for Russia to &apos; fully respect its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations &apos; , guaranteeing the protection of embassies and diplomats .
They need to get a grip on the interior ministers &apos; circus and start to construct a real European area of freedom , security and justice .
I maintain that the reputation of the European Union , Parliament , and all EU institutions has been tarnished .
SMEs and craft sector
Mr President , I am happy to pass on the message of this debate to my colleagues , Mr Lamy and Mr Nielson .
In my view , it is for this reason that the intergovernmental conference stands at the apex of the enlargement , intergovernmental conference , foreign and security policy triangle , whereby it must be made perfectly clear that at no stage , be it with 12 or with 13 candidate States , can the Copenhagen criteria be watered down and that this Parliament will not permit any such watering down and will not ratify any such treaties .
We have case law .
With a view to the informal European Council to be held in Lahti on 20 October , I have written personally to the Heads of State and Government underlining the need for such solidarity .
Illegal fishing ( vote )
As for the discharge of the three agencies , we rightly express concern at the fact that their responsibilities can still overlap and that duplication of effort can still occur .
We now expect both communities to approach the matter by focusing less on past injustice and more on future solutions .
If this year has taught us nothing else , it is that politics - and politics alone - can create prospects for peace in the Middle East .
In summary , there are three areas in which I want EU action to be very effective and very tangible , although when I speak of three areas , that does not mean that they are the only three areas , but I think we could perhaps make out of those three areas our main goals .
Selecting topics that are only to the advantage of one partner is not a sufficient basis for a strategic partnership .
This is , however , an extremely reductionist point of view , because in this area security concerns are and must remain predominant .
We in the June List would like to make the point , once again , in this House that education policy is a policy area for which the responsibility rests with the Member States .
This development , which has been decisively condemned by the workers , has been systematically supported since the beginning of the 1990s and bears the stamp of the European Union and Greek governments .
The ban on whaling is part of the body of EU law , which every new Member State has to accept .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
I would like to talk to you about the resignation of Mr Pelinka from the Management Board of the European Monitoring Centre , Vienna .
We know that lead , mercury , cadmium and hexavalent chromium present high toxic and health risks and numerous Community directives have succeeded in restricting their usage without any risk assessment being made .
Mr Hatzidakis , there has been no change in the Commission &apos; s position .
You surely do not entertain the notion that Parliament will agree to delegate regulatory powers and jurisdiction without the facility to call them back if things go wrong ?
That is what Mr Needle &apos;s report seeks to do , and consequently we are happy to approve it .
I welcome the fact that many like Jonathan Evans and Commissioner Verheugen and colleagues around this Chamber worked very hard on this issue to try to move things along .
We have already had an exchange of opinions in ECON consultations , among the Three and in interparliamentary meetings .
. The report before us highlights the danger to public health of the use of certain substances , as raw materials or as intermediary materials .
I welcome the results and we will be voting in favour of them .
I think that it is also fair to say , on the record , that the era of relatively low food prices is over and that I think that the Commission should not fool people by saying that we are going to go back to lower food prices .
We must give our support to principles , freedom and democracy in this world .
Mr President , Mr President of the European Court of Auditors , first cordial thanks for your explanations , for a constructive report which the Commission will also follow up , as we have just heard from Commissioner Liikanen .
The report focuses particularly on the area of so @-@ called reproductive healthcare for women , and abortions , sterilisation and also , if I may quote , &apos; pain @-@ relief by life @-@ shortening means for terminally ill patients &apos; , which means active euthanasia .
This report also highlights the discriminatory system which , from the earliest age , forces women into a marginalised and subservient role .
Progress towards a common market in the area of security and defence has been achieved .
Your report , Mr Moraes , has drawn to our attention the need for further steps to solve the problems of discrimination and the situation of minorities in the European Union .
The &apos; bush meat &apos; phenomenon is already enjoying wide public attention in Great Britain , but not yet elsewhere .
Given the safeguards of the free movement of persons , however , this percentage will definitely go up in the future .
This also illustrates the fact that we are not properly fulfilling our role as legislators .
We must avoid falling into the &apos; culturism trap &apos; in all respects , not only with regard to human rights .
We all know that not having the appropriate legislation or having bad legislation always leads to high costs ; costs which , in the final analysis , are always borne by the European public .
I should , however , like to point out that the fears about the consequences for people ’ s health are not unfounded .
Not only did the ministers fail to decide on the headquarters of the agency , but they even called into doubt previous promises made by the Council .
The rules of that time were designed for the use of live attenuated vaccines , which were the only vaccines available at the time the directive was adopted 10 years ago .
We note that biotechnology is unable to develop that great potential particularly well in Europe .
As regards the Member State committees that work in parallel with the Commission in the management and implementation of the development programmes , we believe that their key role should be to discuss political priorities and overall strategy with us .
That was such a comprehensive reply that I cannot think of a supplementary question , so I will not ask one .
If the deaths of migrants in freight containers , on the undercarriages of trains or in ship holds in recent months demonstrates anything , it is that responses to economic migration based solely on the monitoring of the illegal movement of people will not prevent people from resorting to desperate measures to travel to Europe .
However , we must not give the impression that this will be achieved very easily and quickly .
We also take the view that the report provides too much detailed regulation and that the Member States are called upon to make data available within too many areas .
It was mooted in Athens 20 years ago as a spur @-@ of @-@ the @-@ moment idea , and subsequently taken up by other European cities .
In any case , the crisis is here and it will cost the European taxpayers .
That is why this Commission proposal and the report are needed .
There are two options open to us .
We have already said on many occasions that , for Europe genuinely to be able to play an important role in Latin America , it must say something different from the United States .

It is equally important that both countries adopt structural reforms that will contribute to increased potential growth , especially reforms of the labour markets and pension systems .
These were targeted checks , specifically based on information supplied by the Member States in the framework of police cooperation , concerning supporters likely to pose a threat to public order .
You champion human rights , but we should not limit ourselves to defending the rights of minorities .
We all send her our very best wishes .
Alongside Mrs Fischer @-@ Boel , we could , moreover , do slightly more to destroy our agriculture , such as it is ; Mr Mandelson would obtain an agreement in Hong Kong and , for our part , we would have slightly higher levels of unemployment .
I endeavoured to make the concept of added therapeutic value acceptable in order to encourage firms to carry out research into substances that are genuinely innovative , and I came up against the opposition of all of the institutions .
In my opinion , zero tolerance is the only way to systematically tackle any infringement and efficiently penalise any breach .
In this respect , may I wish you , Mr Commissioner , a pleasant and successful trip to America , which you will be embarking on tomorrow , I believe ?
There must be no obligation to install solar panels when building a house , carrying out reroofing works , building an extension or replacing a heating system , such as is the case in the Marburg model .
The values referred to in the decision by the Ministers include equality , universality and equal access to health services for everyone - and of course that includes children - regardless of their financial circumstances and these values will be taken into account in all the relevant initiatives by the European Commission .
We must bear in mind that SMEs are also consumers , and the European Union must promote the use of these new technologies and encourage SMEs to participate in on @-@ line markets .
The directive must also naturally be seen as a complement to the environmental impact statements on projects , but these come much later in the decision @-@ making process .
I believe that it is very important that we make more progress in this field and I hope that there are genuine concrete results .
After all , if they were approved and if then the Commission &apos;s draft were rejected , the situation of women would not be improved .
Mr President , firstly I should like to thank you all for a very useful and comprehensive debate .
Regarding the timing , we hope to have a formal communication ready in time for the Spring Council , but I feel it would be better only to have the formal conclusions at the June Council .

We may be able to call on our friends from the Council of Europe too to consider a suspension .
We have a clear responsibility here and we must ensure that information technology does not create a class @-@ based society for future generations .
Madam President , the honourable gentleman &apos;s first question can be answered only with great difficulty .
I have already touched on the issue of regulating working hours , and I will not go into the incredible cost @-@ cutting tactics adopted - even on the roads - by means of artificial self @-@ employed status in the road haulage industry , nor into the &quot; Willi Betz syndrome &quot; and associated regulations , which have also been mentioned several times , nor into issues relating to tariff classification , also including , of course , the issue of external costs .
( The President cut off the speaker )
Transported through energy @-@ efficient , high @-@ voltage direct current cables , that power could be fed into a European supergrid , taking renewable energy from across the EU - tidal power from coastal regions , wind and wave power from windswept north @-@ western Europe , and biomass and geothermal power from wherever they flourish .
This regulation comes at a very appropriate time for the European Union to demonstrate its determination , when other large donors , such as the United States , are pushing for a reconsideration of the commitments made in 1994 at the Cairo Conference on Population and Development .

All sides in this civil conflict – the insurgent Communist Party of Nepal , Marxists and the Nepalese Royalist Army – are committing human rights abuses on a massive scale .
There is no apparent reason why we should have different legal bases for stationary air @-@ conditioning systems on the one hand and for mobile ones on the other .

Madam President , Commissioner , a great deal of money is spent in the agricultural domain ; just imagine that all the money that has been poured into agriculture in the past had gone towards this second pillar we are discussing here today .
Coastal fisheries must be enhanced to give smaller boats a special status .
Forty percent of diseases are linked to unhealthy lifestyles , and a third of cancers are also preventable . One of the main messages in this report is the call on the Commission to prepare an ambitious plan of preventive measures for the entire five @-@ year period .
I have two basic concerns : firstly , much of the evidence suggests that developments on embryonic stem cell research may not deliver the results we all want in terms of progress on some of the most serious illnesses that afflict many members of our society and many of our own families ; secondly , in the course of this research , we will allow people , and in particular , women suffering from infertility to be exploited .
The whole idea behind the Bonn Agreement was that transitional arrangements should be based on traditional , local , national and religious structures in Afghanistan .
A reform of this point was therefore also necessary .
The most important thing is for the seat of the EU to be restricted to one site .
As there cannot be a lack of courtesy at work here , there must be a misunderstanding .
The largest obstacle to promoting this potential is the inadequate R &#91; amp &#93; D infrastructure which is a prerequisite for shaping and retaining scholars and researchers in remote regions .
Overly strict and complex customs regulations impede access to international trade for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises in particular .
The Commission &apos;s approach based on cost @-@ effectiveness failed to take account of more recent research showing that small particles pose an enormous threat to health .
Madam Commissioner , I would like to ask a question about the future of the RECHAR initiative which , it would appear , will no longer be included .

We made this explicit pledge to Parliament and the Committee on Budgets .
All I wish to say is that I completely agree with Mr Schulz and that what we have heard today , in this House , is uncalled for .
– Mr President , Commissioner , ethnic and religious violence in Nigeria has concerned our Parliament on countless occasions .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I will be very brief .
We may agree with many , although not all the opinions .
This is to highlight the fact that customs officers are also in the service of the European Union and have important European tasks to perform .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Andria on his excellent work , first of all , and secondly on his political courage in this difficult matter .
The need for haste , however , must not impair the quality of the legislative groundwork .
At the moment we are lacking the means of researching and intervening in these issues , as Mr Whitehead quite rightly described , and for this reason we are lacking the organized will to carry it out .
In the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , we have the chance to implement the next stage of the political project known as the area of freedom , security and justice , provided appropriate monitoring is carried out by the European institutions .
They quite rightly emphasised the difficulties caused by these attacks for our representatives on the ground , and I join you , Commissioner , in praising the dedication and bravery of these representatives .

Agriculture may also be a source of contamination and cattle and livestock can pollute rivers and lakes .
The definitive strengthening of Parliament ’ s role as co @-@ legislator might also be mentioned , this being something that we need to promote .
Rather than put it the way you put it , I would say that it does not necessarily follow that blood from a remunerated source is any less safe than blood from an unremunerated source and the studies that have been produced more recently on this issue tend to support that proposition .
The conflict as to how much degressivity we need - how much less , how much more - must be continually managed and it is logical here , I believe , for us to say the less the degressivity , the greater the legitimacy .
There should be a fair appeal process .
One out of forty four , I ask you .

While it keeps the institution of the library user @-@ friendly and recognises it as the best cultural institution with such limited funding , it also puts forward an appropriate solution for the future development of copyright .
Madam President , it is not only necessary for the overall thrust of ideas and initiatives to be right - above all the detail must also be right .
There are things that they want us to take seriously .
We must continue to fight for them to stay alive and be free .
In general , parliaments propose additional and supplementary features . This increases still further the political significance of the position of our group and of other groups that will vote in favour of these amendments on the grounds that the bridge is economically and environmentally unsustainable .
We are already doing this in the fight against climate change , with our commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 % by the year 2020 .
As one of our Presidency objectives , the United Kingdom sees this as a significant step for Serbia and Montenegro on the road to the European Union .
Formal sitting - 20th anniversary of German reunification
Mr President , I would like to thank all those who have contributed to this debate .

The fact is that when there is damage as a result of a hidden defect , it is generally discovered at the point when the damage occurs .

The era we live in is not an era of globalisation ; it is an era of imperialism .
However , whatever the sins of omission of the international community , which we deeply regret at this time of sadness and remembrance , let us not forget the sins of commission by the attacking Bosnian Serb forces .
I am shocked to hear from Commissioner Barrot that Member States do not apply maritime law uniformly .

He is a gentleman by the name of Chenjerai &apos; Hitler &apos; Hunzvi .
Extending this would cost EUR 17.4 million per year for each further week .
. The problems of the Middle East are never far from our political sight , and nor should they be .
My political comment is that today we are witnessing a rare moment in the European Parliament : complete unanimity in all wings of the House , from the right wing to the left wing , on the direction in which Parliament wishes to take a specific legislative initiative .
There have been few practical results , and the greatest benefits have been reaped by western consultants and local middlemen .
If you recall - again in the votes today - we voted on the Globalisation Fund .

Because for those who are friendly with Serbia or with Milosevic as the President of Yugoslavia , now is the time to put this friendship to the test , by speaking up for peace .
We will closely monitor this appointments policy , which must be open and decisive .
At the same time , if we are to believe the promises made last summer by the President of the French Republic to the Prince of Monaco , the Council and the Commission are seriously envisaging granting the Principality the benefits of the euro - at a time when the Principality is promoting tax evasion on a gigantic scale , to the detriment of the interests of the Member States - without there being any requirement on the residents of Monaco to make the slightest financial effort .
Rules which all the Member States must incorporate in their national systems and abide by .
Finally , I want a pact which will achieve stability in the eurozone , not unequal treatment of Member States , a pact with a long @-@ term strategy , not knee @-@ jerk reactions , which safeguards the Lisbon objectives without sending the economies into a vicious circle of recession .
Norway has tacked this problem with a policy of containment rather than slaughter and the question must be asked whether consideration should be given in the European Union to alternative methods of combating the disease .
What will it cost when two wild hamsters are removed when an industrial park is built ; who can pay for that ?
This week we are debating the milk quota system in a remastered form .

Mr President , yesterday an opinion poll was published in Scotland that included a question about the draft EU Constitution .
Fine !
I should like to know what you base these assurances on . I would also like to know if it would be possible to introduce economic sanctions , especially having seen how pointless it was to believe that approving the customs union would help the country return to democracy .
This pattern should stop as it undermines the work of the EU and this Parliament .
The current system , with so many exceptions and derogations , has become complex and opaque .
And then it would be curtains for the rule of law !
Let me give you an example from my own country . The switch to low @-@ solvent paints and coatings has meant that solvent consumption in Austria has fallen by about 50 % since 1990 .
Madam President , let me start by saying that the Commission is deeply shocked and saddened by the helicopter accident yesterday in which 10 foreign officials working in Bosnia for peace died and , among them , our very much appreciated Deputy High Representative , Dr Wagner .

Some of the ideas put forward , such as those included by the rapporteur in his initial amendments , deserve to be properly studied in the context of the future review of the regulation on the allocation of slots and - I repeat - the Commission staff , whom I thank again for the valuable contribution they have made in these weeks of difficult work , are willing to do this and are indeed in the process of drafting the new text .
It is certainly looking for the things that the Commission was seeking consultees from about whether the current regulations have become too legalistic , too bureaucratic and could be simplified .

For example , in Finland and Sweden we long ago reached the stage where the forest is used as it grows .
No action was taken , there was not a trace of the zero tolerance policy promised us at the beginning of this period .
To be frank , I regret to say that many of its opponents are hiding behind the argument concerning Europe .
With regard to the amendment proposed by the Committee on Fisheries represented by Mr Souchet and Mr Jean @-@ Pierre on behalf of the Europe of Nations Group , I would point out that as a liberal and as spokesman for the Committee on Development and Cooperation , I am against it .
I do not have much to say about the resolution , but I think it is becoming increasingly clear that the European Union needs to equip itself with stronger legal instruments for the enforcement of fundamental rights .

The sum of 35 million euros , if we can keep this for a number of years , will go a long way to clearing the world of what has been an horrendous scourge for millions of people in the developing world .
One example of this is the recruitment of over @-@ qualified people for less high @-@ powered jobs .
It is also very important , in the current difficult phase of the Middle East peace process , that Europeans should continue to pull in the same direction and that they spoke with one voice in the Middle East declaration of the Heads of State and Government on 25 March .
People do not take so much notice any more .
Precisely because this is the case it only works if we say that , in the ratification process for Amsterdam , we need to ensure that the next intergovernmental conference takes place with the European Parliament enjoying codecision .
With regard to the standard of Turkish prisons , the EU has repeatedly demanded a prison system in Turkey which conforms to international standards .
Secondly , who can apply for a licence ?
To use one of the few political clichés that has not been used this week , the current Commission is drinking in the last chance saloon .
We therefore constantly stress in this report the need for active employment policies and lifelong learning systems .
To a large extent , this sector is one towards which the public is favourably disposed , and there is also support for amending the Treaty in nearly all the Member States &apos; governments .
Secondly , the financial burden .
These fishing agreements should be primarily negotiated by the industry itself .
I should like to point out that we demand more in this House in that regard than many parliaments who are states of this Union and who have parliamentary democracy at their core .
Unfortunately I pressed the plus key by mistake .
With last week &apos; s launch and today &apos; s debate we are leaving &quot; the follow @-@ up to Nice &quot; behind us and instead entering into the debate on the future of Europe .
I would like , therefore , to spend half of my speaking time on questions to the Commission .

That is not because Moses was lazy , did not have a computer and had to engrave it all laboriously in stone - it is a simply a well @-@ drafted text !
This approach also allows the SESAR system to be implemented in ideal conditions at minimal cost .
The Commission proposal also guarantees budget stability and in particular is also more consistent with WTO objectives over all .
Last July &apos;s code of conduct was a first small step , and now we need further steps .
However , some countries need to cut back on their budgets and others – like my own , Ireland – need to spend more on infrastructure , because they have a deficit , but that is not allowed under the rules .
It is an opportunity for fair , sustainable and joint development .
Special thanks on behalf of the Council are owed to the rapporteur Mrs Jäätteenmäki , the chairman of the AFCO committee Mr Leinen , and Mr Méndez de Vigo MEP .
The European Union of the Deaf has made clear its view that there has to be a uniform standard for text telephones in the whole of the EU .
You have said it very clearly .
The common position is , in fact , quite a significant step forward but it does not deal with all the problems .
In addition , authorities will be encouraged to promote environmental education of the public , which will also undoubtedly be in the authorities &apos; own interests , in that the extent to which people participate effectively can only improve through education .
Or we are in danger of making extensive use of a herbicide , with the consequences that can entail for the water in which that herbicide is soluble .
For example , the European Union is one of the world &apos;s largest producers of starchy products , which are essential for nutrition .
We have given the subject much consideration together with our defence colleagues in the European Union and we agree that the fight against terrorism should not fall within the Petersberg tasks , as I previously anticipated .
As Mr Patten knows better than anyone , we live in a complex world , in which the European Union has both internal responsibilities , such as the birth of the Constitution or enlargement , and also external responsibilities : the new relationship with Russia , our continuing problems in the Balkans , our responsibilities in Central Asia , Iran , Iraq and Afghanistan , the Middle East problem and taking relations with the United States in a new direction .
It is therefore time to do something about this .
However , we do know that in many cases freedom of expression cannot always be taken for granted and I now appeal to China to move towards greater democracy and openness in this area .
We would wish Mr Prodi and his Commission that success in 2004 .
The Hague programme is being used to serve the policy of separating its citizens from those of third countries , who are being constantly photographed as a source of more evil .
In addition , it is striking that the North Sea emergency measure does not prohibit targeted fishing of cod with stationary nets , in which precisely those fish ready for spawning are caught , within the twelve @-@ mile zone and within the plaice box .
It is now our former Austrian companions from the Christian Democratic Union who are in difficulty because of elections in their country .
It is already clear that we need to fight terrorism .
Foremost amongst those priorities is policy coherence between external commitments and internal policies .
I hope you will take this point on board and reject any such procedure in future .
Secondly , now is the moment , instead of simply ending the critical dialogue , to take advantage of the situation and reconsider a comprehensive global policy as regards Iran .
We shall now proceed to the votes .
In some countries , when reactors have had to be shut down , there has been a loss of electricity which has caused severe hardship .
To prevent the situation from escalating I wish to refrain from commenting , other than to say that the Conference of Presidents has taken the matter in hand .
Well then , I would like to know whose fault it is .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , since 1 May 2004 Belarus has been a direct neighbour of the European Union .
It will be clarified very soon .
Any Christian denomination based on the Bible knows that abuse of women cannot be covered by the cloak of charity .
I personally had a meeting scheduled with him and am saddened that this has not taken place .
( SV ) Mr President , I would like to start by thanking all my fellow Members in Parliament and in the Committee for the support they have given me in my work on this report .
That is simply inadequate .
I therefore fully share the comments of the PPE @-@ DE Group and will make every effort to bring about effective cooperation with all of the institutions between now and the entry into force of the Treaty .
We must also call polluters to greater account and strictly apply the &apos; polluter pays &apos; principle .
On numerous other questions , it was rather up to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to express an opinion .
This is best done in relevant international conventions and in the Charter .
I must , however , express my frustration at the JPA ’ s inability to exert any positive influence over the situation in Zimbabwe .
Nevertheless , in this matter , we fought alongside President Barroso at the European Council to have the objectives complied with and to have the timetable complied with .
Madam President , Commissioner , I am happy to add my own thanks to the Commission .
The debate is closed .
Of course , this must form part of an overall policy on migration and immigration .
Oil is an outdated source .
The two protocols concerning certain fisheries concessions for Iceland and Norway for the period 2009 @-@ 2014 provide for the renewal of the previous 2004 @-@ 2009 protocols with unchanged concessions for Iceland and a relatively modest increase in concessions for Norway , on the basis of which Norway will renew the fish transit agreement .
The public can no longer follow the development of security and defence policy , and neither can Parliament monitor it properly .
There are , however , also successful examples of restructuring where new jobs have been created and regions have been able to survive and even progress , with longer @-@ term employment .
We appreciate your assistance very much and we thank you most warmly for it .
In other words , it does not mean that every Member State will have to reduce its usage by 50 % but it will depend on what a Member State has already achieved .
This is the essential difference between the Amendment No and the original text of the resolution as passed by the Social Affairs Committee .
The issue of decommissioning funds is one that has been rightly raised and is of great concern .

As there is no time here for a detailed analysis , I would like to make just a few comments .
Therefore the REX Committee is proposing to the Commission and the Council to extend the Community quota for sea bass and sea bream .
Therefore , Mr Sterckx , I would ask you to utilise your proven capacity for finding a consensus and to make every effort to find a solution to the problem of the committee , which cannot be a committee of inquiry - although you call it a temporary committee - not only because it would go against the Treaty , Mr President , but because it would cancel out your excellent work and that of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , robbing it of content and resulting in it not being worth the paper it is written on .
A Deputy Prime Minister has been appointed to ensure the overall coordination of the process .
As was said in the debate , East Timor will also be able to benefit from the &apos; Everything But Arms &apos;Initiative , helping it to develop its foreign trade .
However , we believe that it is more important that those measures become reality , and that they do not face technical and artificial obstacles .
Therefore , the European Union must cooperate intensively with Ukraine , strengthening democracy in this country and speeding up its integration in the European Union .
That must be the message on 1 January when , hopefully , the new programme can come into effect .
I shall focus on just a few areas in the short time available to me . Setting up a free trade area might seem the obvious way of stimulating the economy and ensuring that the people of the southern shores of the Mediterranean are not dying of starvation whilst on its northern shores we are being killed by cholesterol .
The exclusion of non @-@ professional sports shoes and children ’ s shoes ( which can also include women ’ s shoes ) is also unacceptable .
Mr President , I would like to say to the Commission that once again we are faced with a problem which relates to Mediterranean agriculture ; an agricultural problem - fruit and vegetables - in which Mediterranean production in particular is directly involved .
I would ask you to make it clear to the Member States that supervision cannot be had for free .
in writing . - ( SV ) I am voting in favour of this motion for a resolution , demanding that the problems associated with body scanning be investigated before a decision is taken .
I must again point out that I cannot of course be in two places at once and it goes without saying that it is part of the budget Commissioner &apos; s duties to take part in the trialogue in preparation for the conciliation procedure for the 2002 budget .
Millions of Europeans rely on the Internet , whether directly or indirectly , in their daily lives .
in writing . - ( LT ) The trust of Europe &apos;s consumers is essential for the internal market to work efficiently and thrive .
The European Union can and must act in this area by supporting restructuring and encouraging the introduction of cleaner @-@ burning , more fuel @-@ efficient vessels .
In this case there has been a series of coincidences which have inspired an enthusiastic solidarity movement in our country in which the Government , all the political parties and the rest of society have taken part .
It is a serious problem .
Two years ago , three out of every five Gazans depended on UN assistance ; it is now four out of every five .
I think that the Groups should congratulate ourselves on the agreement reached with regard to the recommendation , but it should be of concern to us that , even though we are not part of the conflict , it should have cost us more than what is reasonable to reach it .
It is because an excessive intake of vitamins and minerals can cause damage to health that safe maximum amounts must be laid down for the addition of such substances to foodstuffs .
I think the honourable Member accepts that one is looking for steady trends , rather than being too nailed down to specific figures in specific years in specific countries .
We believe the European Parliament should be involved .
Amendments Nos 1 @-@ 3 I accept in full .
We know that the Structural Fund regulations integrate the Community URBAN initiative into the basic programmes .
Over the past few weeks some of you may have heard the former director of the International Monetary Fund explain in a previous report , from three or four years ago : &apos; We said at the IMF that the crisis was going to happen , and we explained how to prevent it &apos; .
Without that faith it becomes much more difficult to put well considered and effective management tools in place .

Mr President , I endorse the statements made by the rapporteur and Mr Kindermann and there is no need for me to repeat them .
I want to respond to the motion for a resolution , not least since I suspect that in it are the bones of the discussion that we will be having between the Union &apos;s institutions on CFSP over the coming years .
Another peculiar thing is paragraph 52 where the Commission is being urged to take advantage of the momentum , as it were , for the enlargement process .
Mr President , Commissioner , when in 1988 the European Parliament , acting as a budgetary authority , managed to have the funds intended for cooperation with Latin American and Asia allocated to separate budget lines , a decisive step was taken in the regionalisation of Community external relations ; an approach which has been consolidated as the one most in line with the idea of functionality and specificity which governs Community policy and as the most effective in terms of development .
This push for liberalisation is currently presenting more risks than benefits in our ports .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the main object of the initiative of the Republic of Finland which we have before us today is to reserve to the Council implementing powers with regard to certain detailed provisions and practical procedures for examining visa applications .
Mr President , this is not a point of order .
The conciliatory message that the European Union has recently sent to the Russian Federation regarding stepping up relations on various levels is not , and must not be , separate from an invitation to dialogue and to implementing all possible measures to try to resolve the worst crisis of the post @-@ Soviet era without causing casualties .
Although the idea of introducing a tax on financial transactions seems to support the general public , even if the G20 leaders failed to agree on setting such a contribution at global level , I feel obliged to mention that this could have an adverse impact in the medium and long term .
We can but hope that the little drop will be a revitalising one .
Written Statements ( Rule 142 )
I also support the rapporteur , Mrs Ewing , to the full when she asks for priority attention to those of less than 50 employees .
( The President cut off the speaker )

It is not very many years since the French security service sank one of Greenpeace &apos;s vessels in a New Zealand harbour .
So our aim is multi @-@ faceted , we need a better deal for agriculture in developing countries , but we also need to strengthen targeted support for certain aspects of European agriculture .
Mr President , I should like to inform you that a few days ago in the rue Wirtz , a woman was raped and then murdered , and I support your efforts to secure the establishment of a police station , which is urgently needed and would be greatly welcomed by those who live and work in the surrounding area .
Furthermore , unless I &apos;m wrong , you already received a written reply at the beginning of the month on a question similar to the one that you have just asked .
And this is a perfect illustration of the situation we are living in in our country .
Survivors of the holocaust should not need to hear that people in Europe are chanting &apos; murderers , murderers &apos; when there is a gathering to show support for the state of Israel .
The very nature of this kind of forum , a private structure , unfortunately prevailed .
Additionally , it is worth pointing out the fact that there are people living in Latvia who , as members of the Interfront group , fought against Latvia &apos;s independence , called for the preservation of the evil empire that was the USSR , still deny the fact of Latvia &apos;s occupation , still excuse Soviet totalitarian crimes in the Baltic states , and voted against Latvia &apos;s membership of the European Union and NATO .
Tobacco , we are told , kills half a million people each year in the European Union but do we ban it ?
&lt; empty &gt;
The proposed action plan , the joint inspection structure and any new fisheries control agency must involve all the stakeholders in introducing a harmonised code of conduct for inspections .
I feel , therefore , that there is unfairness in the way this matter is being addressed .
I hope and wait for the Commission to be strict here and we shall soon see how – with one eye on Italy – it approaches the new Pact and if it is worth the paper it is written on .
It is far preferable to encourage legal and legitimate organ donation .
Madam President , I would also like to congratulate our colleague Mrs Gröner on achieving the 323 signatures .
( PL ) Mr President , I am speaking straight after Mr Rack and Mr Savary , and I would like to thank both of them for their work in the European Parliament .
This would leave room for flexible solutions in all the Member States , solutions that might be different in Germany from what they are in Great Britain .
Therefore , there is a continued need for a strong cohesion policy based on solidarity .
Poland produces half of all soft fruit in the EU , including cherries , currants and raspberries , and Polish Members of this House have called on the Commission on several occasions and via a number of channels to put protective measures in place for the soft fruit market .
It is not a case of denying responsibility . It just goes to show that there are even difficulties on the cooperation front sometimes , which are partly structural in nature .
As regards employment , I am no fan of deregulation - quite the reverse .
I am grateful to the rapporteur for his report .
Paragraph 32 of the draft resolution should be read against this dark background .
The Commission is backing water access projects and programmes in several countries .
I would like to give the example of Portugal , which has launched an ambitious programme of construction of childcare facilities .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
in writing . - I followed my group in voting in favour of this resolution , although our amendment on speeding up a review of type @-@ approval legislation was not adopted .
Many complain that it is impossible for them to monitor the programmes that their children watch , and parents will need help to become considerably more media @-@ literate in the future , if they are genuinely to protect their children .
This is a delicate and difficult matter which concerns the reputation of a Member of the House and that of this House as a whole .
Why should we , as high income earners , not have to pay the same taxes as everyone else in the countries where we live ?
My congratulations to Mrs De Brún for this report and , of course , for this procedure to begin a new era .
Yet exactly the opposite has happened .
The two countries were opposed right up to the last minute : the United Kingdom - I mention this as a reminder - and Germany .
We left many issues to one side but now we should perhaps revisit them .
This proposal now forms the basis of the review by the working party , together with the ideas presented earlier by Klaus Hänsch .
Basically there are two states , with separate economies , trade , industry , agricultural policy and employment policy .
Over the last decade , their role has been considerably strengthened .
We are evidently debating a highly technical subject matter , namely the interoperability of both high @-@ speed and conventional rail systems .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in discussing this resolution we should be aware that Congo is larger than Europe . A country containing some 300 tribes , some of which live in total isolation , as the communications network is virtually non @-@ existent .
I believe it is essential for public servants to be answerable to the public , which is why they must give objective and detailed accounts of how the public funds made available to them have been used .
That said , as things stand , everything points to the conditions being fulfilled within the timeframe laid down .
The Maastricht Treaty includes a separate title on public health , and the Court of Justice , with the Decker and Kohll judgments , has ruled on the Community dimension of certain social security services .
In order to take this issue forward , we have decided to invite the Chair of the Convention , Mr Herzog , to contribute to this high @-@ level exchange of views which , I am sure , will stimulate the Convention &apos; s work of drawing up the Charter .
It has been decided that this circulation is to start on 1 January 2002 .
We therefore feel it is crucial to take account of the activities of those working in creative arts and to improve their social status .
What this means is that Europe should abandon its individuality , or a large proportion of it anyway , while Turkey is allowed to stay an Islamic club .
Lastly , this process has a great deal of potential in terms of promoting economic openness , development , democracy and respect for human rights in Turkey and this should not go to waste .
The &apos; miracle &apos; of EMU signalled new austerity programmes and new programmes to reduce the purchasing power of grass @-@ roots families , massacre the social and political rights which the working classes have fought for , keep unemployment high and cut social spending under the Stability Pact .
President @-@ in @-@ Office . - ( SL ) Mr Dillen , a Member of the European Parliament , said that in the situation concerning the food market , we should not just alleviate the symptoms , but cure the illness .
This consultation preceded the submission of the Commission &apos;s legislative proposal .
At the last but one meeting the Italian Presidency took the appropriate steps to safeguard our budgetary rights , and I hope that position will survive through to the end .
in writing . - ( LV ) I have been in touch with beekeeping organisations in Latvia .
in writing . - ( PL ) I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a Council decision on the multiannual technical guidelines for the research programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel - C6 @-@ 0248 / 2007 - .

The so @-@ called European idea is not thrown into jeopardy by those who reject the Lisbon Treaty .
For us , it is the direct expression of the inalienable rights of the citizens of Macao .
We do not want to undermine the European Parliament &apos;s right and duty of political control .
That is why we put climate change on the agenda of our EU summits with China and India .
I voted for the proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the European Union @-@ Brazil Strategic Partnership because I feel that this is beneficial to both sides and can contribute to the development of ties between these two entities with the aim of promoting the common good in both areas and throughout the whole world .
We abandon what we know how to do in order to import what somebody else is doing cheaper , not because it is more profitable , but because there are less costs , less taxes , less social constraints .
With finite resources fast depleting , Europe will have to radically re @-@ examine its patterns of energy supply and consumption .
As the author of the question is not present , Question No 40 lapses .
The first point is the strong consensus for the proposal to deinstitutionalise psychiatric services ; the aim of abolishing the internment and segregation of the mentally ill is seen by the committee as a step forwards in affirming the dignity of the person and , for that reason as well , Europe is fully entitled to deal with it .
We therefore have to be careful and to weigh up all the consequences of the measures to be taken .
I disagree with the previous speaker that charging for books would not cause people problems in seeking information .
Last Friday , as Paulo Casaca told us , their executioners took a 23 @-@ year @-@ old girl from her cell and led her to the gallows without first allowing her access to her parents .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Mann on his interesting report .
It is also suggested that the blue card should not be restricted to highly @-@ qualified employees .
It is true that Europe has too often been reactive with policies that proved to be wrong with regard to Iran .
In the last few days , we have witnessed considerable progress in terms of talks with the Council .
As honourable Members will know , no provision is made for such penalties under the fund rules for the period 2000 @-@ 2006 .
The new LEADER + programme now covers all rural areas in the European Union , which will open up greater possibilities for potential projects .
These funds were then used to provide subordinated loans to the business community and universities , thus giving tremendous momentum to investments for the coming years at this point in the crisis .
Was he not invited , or is this an error in the minutes ?
Your question was not relevant to the present subject .
I have looked at the various estimates of what this would cost the industry .
Mr Mulder constantly hides behind this argument .
They should be very well aware of the extent to which olive oil is a source of livelihood and business throughout the Mediterranean cultural area .
There is more coordination and a better relationship between them and I believe that we are achieving very positive results in practice .
This would have been superfluous if the other authorities had completed their work in good time .
What is left , for example , of the right of Austrians to choose their own destiny , if that choice is dictated on their behalf by those who decide what should or should not be done and if their duly and legally elected leaders are received in an insulting manner , as they were recently by you in Portugal , Mr President of the Council .
It is vital that environmental economic accounts contribute to policy evaluation , making available data concerning the environmental impact of economic activities .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development . - ( BG ) As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development , I would like to say how pleased I am with the final version of the European Energy Programme for Recovery .
The meeting gave the European Union the opportunity to confirm its conviction that internal security is complementary to justice and respect for human rights , and that the strategic partnership between the European Union and Russia continues to be based on shared values such as democracy , the rule of law , human rights and freedom of expression .
Votes
This procedure , based upon obligations under Directive 79 / 409 / EEC on the protection of wild birds and Directive 92 / 43 / EEC on the protection of natural habitats and wild fauna and flora , reached the stage of reasoned opinion – the last step before bringing the case before the European Court of Justice – in April 2003 .
There is unemployment ; there is confusion .
This leads me to the conclusion that subsidiarity - countries &apos; ability to arrange things themselves within a much broader range - is not being sufficiently respected .
Yet the cost need not be prohibitive , and our report points to examples of inexpensive interventions and changes of local practice which can make a significant difference .
Madam President , last April , when we received Commander Ahmad Shah Massoud in this Chamber , he told us that the fall of the Taliban regime was inevitable given that the Pakistani government would find itself unable to provide it with any political and , in particular , military aid .
We are not giving a completely clean bill of health to the Commission and we retain our criticisms .
I think you have an opportunity to start anew .
Thank you for your attention .
The European Parliament is rightly emphasizing its links with Asia .
Now , by extending European youth and education programmes to Turkey , the EU is taking another step down this road .
The same could happen in other cases , such as that of Johnson Controls , which is threatening to move to Romania , that of Lear and those of many other firms relocating to Poland and other EU countries .
Otherwise we will essentially only have lost ground during the unofficial negotiations , and not gained anything at all .
This will result in overall cost savings for many businesses .
I agree absolutely with this assessment , if and insofar as the reference to economic success concerns businesses .
I have lost my voice and so I do not know whether I will be able to deliver my usual explanations of vote tomorrow .
First of all , I have to say that , although holding the summit in Vietnam is naturally a showcase for the reforms achieved in that country , it nevertheless has to be noted that there is still a yawning chasm between the dream of an effective and honest trading environment and reality .
We have failed them , failed to give them the proper tools of knowledge and information to be able to cooperate and deal with the new opportunities that are available .
We also need an appropriate balance between large and small states .
But then , here in this Parliament we have a couple of &apos; Pavlovs &apos; : Mr Schulz , Mr Daul , Mr Verhofstadt , all absent now - they have run away instead of speaking here to focus the budget on quality rather than quantity , for example , by limiting regional and cohesion funds to the poorer Member States , saving 30 % of those funds , and investing that money in innovation and future oriented policies .
SMEs should now , however , be granted legal protection that would not only keep them from the risk of the insecurity caused by bank failures , but would also enable them to operate from a position of greater competitiveness and improved economic , financial and employment stability .
We should pay attention to assessments of any alternative solutions , such as land routes , which should take into account construction costs as well as ecological safety .
For the European Parliament , codecision making will increase dramatically , covering up to 95 % of the legislation in areas such as freedom , security and justice , agriculture , fisheries , research and structural funds .
The remuneration and taxation of MEPs is therefore a national affair .
I feel that the paragraphs entitled &apos; Defining the future of Europe &apos; and &apos; Relations with the enlarged EU &apos;s neighbours &apos; are the key to the realisation that we need to start laying the foundations for the Union &apos;s future political outlook as of now .
There are so many other things which Parliament has to discuss , but it is exceptionally important that today we should have a chance to discuss the Mediterranean and the Middle East because the directions we set for our policies in this region in the coming months should be thoroughly discussed and debated here ; they involve fundamental decisions on how we are going to develop our relationship with our neighbours ; and they involve fundamental decisions which will affect the whole relationship for the first part of this century between Europe and the Islamic world .
If , for example , there is to be any marked increase in the birth rate , both mothers and fathers need far better legal safeguards .
The risk in harmonising legislation is always that progressive countries may be forced to lower the standard of their provisions .
Can the Commission rapidly earmark funds ( for example for residual balances entered against the CSF and other Community programmes ) for immediate preventive checks on the structural resistance of not only public premises such as schools , hospitals etc. but also premises on which large numbers of people are employed , ( for example factories ) throughout Greece , to establish how well they will stand up to major earthquakes ?
The debate is closed .
The emergence of new technology should also be used to ensure that it is easier for more people to use the internet , in more societies .
Tourism may appear buoyant today , but as it is growing in the shadow of globalisation , it will be eroded as a result of that very same growth and expansion , unless we take care to provide it with a framework establishing conditions of sustainability and guarantees of security , quality and diversity , as well as a high level of professionalism and the necessary stability of professionals and workers .
I am always hearing that the Bosnian Government is cooperating with the Tribunal , the Croats distinctly less so , and the Republika Srpska and Serbia very little indeed .
( FR ) Mr President , please excuse me , I may be mistaken but I thought that when votes were about people they had to remain secret , which has not been the case .
The biofuel solution , then , is one possible way of achieving control of European production of arable crops .
However , Greece is also the victim of its bad neighbour , Turkey .
The Garriga Polledo report deals with cases under Member State responsibility in which a failure to enforce Community legislation on securities and guarantees harms the Community &apos; s interests .
We are in fact convinced that respect for the trade rules established at international level and within a multilateral framework is the mainstay of economic growth and , more generally , of the peaceful relationship between nations .
To enable Europe to hold its own in global competition ?
In the case of such a fundamental expansion , would the Council also be prepared to increase resources for this programme correspondingly ?
. Mr Czarnecki , one can , at present , do no more than speculate on this issue .
At the time of our intervention at first reading on the Community action programme on customs , we welcomed this initiative designed to better coordinate national customs controls at the Union &apos;s external borders , while at the same time being concerned at the direction taken by the European Parliament : its amendments tended to &apos; communitize &apos; the national customs and to promote the objective of a &apos; domestic market &apos; which is even more unified than the present single market and which would virtually deny countries any margin for manoeuvre in their legislation .
I know Mr Ferri feels very strongly about commitology but it seems to me there are much broader issues . This links in with my own report , as I mentioned earlier .
I would ask you to stand by the original , namely ‘ sociological characteristics of Chechen society ’ .
However , it would be more proper to increase the percentage for research funds from 1 to 2 % .
( HU ) Thank you , Madam President .
We have therefore asked for the creation of new budgetary lines in areas of spending that are very sensitive for Parliament , such as agencies , rural development and other categories such as external action , with a view to , I repeat , a very clear commitment from Parliament and from the Committee on Budgetary Control , which was to contribute to maximum transparency , which is what public opinion demands of us .
Estonia is a full Member of the EU .
You don &apos;t find yourselves wasting European money every now and again ? &quot;
We cannot base our efforts to protect the climate on hiding pollution away for future generations .
The launch of independent radio broadcasts currently depends purely on the goodwill of the European Commission .
I supported the report by my French socialist colleague Mr Le Foll since it defends the idea that European agriculture must continue to adapt , as it has already begun to do , to the consequences of the changes in climate taking place and to prepare for the impact that these changes will have in future for many regions of the European Union .
It is a country of great natural beauty and boasts an abundance of water , which is a great natural resource in that part of the world .
The Commission &apos;s document refers to the alleged need to develop further legal immigration policies to alleviate the perils of demographic ageing .
The next item is the Commission statement on the import of poultry carcases .
We must ensure that no treaties are signed with the EU and no financial aid is provided without a commitment to respect human rights and to protect minorities , in particular Christians .
However , here we have a situation where members of staff appear willy @-@ nilly to be able to demonstrate and Members appear to be denied the same privilege !
In the Kahn Committee Mr Ford and I did our very best , for these reasons , to argue that existing projects of the European Community should be used to further the aim of countering racism and xenophobia , just as we often do with projects concerned with education , culture and media and the cause of equality between the sexes .
Now to implementation .
I would refer here once more to Parliament ’ s criticism of Russia .
The aim of this initiative – as already mentioned by the presidency – was to define which types of conduct should be punishable in all Member States and to establish minimum rules relating to the penalties for such offences .
Implementing and continually improving the high standards for nuclear safety is a top priority for EU regulators and operators ; but the very concept of continuous improvement implies that we need to draw the lessons first , despite the fact that the accident was caused by external factors and not by malfunctions at the plant .
Provided two individuals have consented to have such contact , there are no grounds for condemning them .
I would therefore urgently request that you make this announcement today , and I would also point out that this is the consequence of the procedure followed with documents received , which is that the President says that documents have been received and refers to the Annex that is later attached to the Minutes .
We have different roles to play , but we have the same ambition : to make Europe united , so we can defend our values and interests .
We have not , then , had any response regarding the varying assessments of the scientists , and I would like to hear your answer to this .
We have finally adopted the financial perspective for 2007 @-@ 2013 , which is also good news for the candidate countries and for countries of the Western Balkans .
We should renounce those Member States which obstruct the work of the Committee on Petitions . There are some and we all know who they are .
Today we are commemorating two of them who were not members of a government , who did not sign treaties , who did not work in the spotlight reserved for the powerful , but who were great men of vision and exponents of integration , that is , Jean Monnet and Altiero Spinelli .
Petitioners have to wait too long for a reply , or for the solution to their problem .
In public infrastructures , the name of the game is now long depreciation periods and low revenues .
We are fed up with constant changes to the agenda and postponements at short notice .
However , protectionism further hurts international trade and the EU &apos;s interests directly .
The basic principles governing our action to manage the situation in Iraq , however , remain unchanged . The territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country , the vital role of the United Nations and the right of the Iraqi people to determine their future .
We Europeans must engage in international politics , whether in the field of foreign policy , where we must work to prevent conflict , or in the sphere of internal security , to which you have referred , where we must play our part in a concerted effort to combat international crime .
( PT ) Mr President , although the MEDA programme is quite new , it has already had positive results on the ground , on the other side of the Mediterranean .
We expect a great deal from the democratisation process , and the Commission should not , in the report it is preparing on all aspects of the situation in Lebanon and on EU @-@ Lebanon relations , overlook certain key issues that are fundamental for the future of democracy . These include the return of the death penalty ; the tens of thousands of people who have disappeared in Lebanon ; Lebanon ’ s adoption of the Rome Statute on which the International Criminal Court is founded ; its adoption of the GenevaConventionRelating to the Status of Refugees ; a solution to the issue of Palestinian refugees ; and also certain individual cases of great concern to this House , such as that of the lawyer Mr Mughrabi , who is in prison today as a result of statements he actually made in this Chamber to Members of the European Parliament .
In this respect , the visit to the region in April by the British Prime Minister , Mr Blair , only served to confirm the serious nature of the crisis in the peace process .
I have often criticised some of the initiatives that we discuss in this place , but I think this is a positive move .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is not exactly crowded in here .
However , measures by the EU alone are not enough to ensure that global warming does not exceed two degrees Celsius .
This is perhaps a rather unusual way for a President @-@ in @-@ Office to inform Parliament of something .
Adequate guarantees to consumers can be provided through comprehensive information , and declarations to competent authorities and pro @-@ forma registration can be accepted for healthcare professions .
The joint debate is closed .
Developing countries should be free - as we are - to choose whether or not they have privatised or public utilities to provide their water services .
Therefore measures must be taken in all European countries and in countries where it does not yet happen .
Due to lack of time , I will not expand on this subject , but I consider that , in order for the report &apos;s objectives to have beneficial results in the economies of all 27 countries , not 25 , as specified in the text , it is necessary to perform the comparative review of their economies and , according to the results , to adopt a set of actions that would create equal conditions for developing the effects proposed by the project .
I hope that the Council of Ministers for Social Affairs , which is meeting on 5 October , will incorporate the conclusions of the House in its decisions , as the single mothers on whom this report concentrates need action to be taken urgently .
Lagendijk report ( A5 @-@ 0394 / 2001 )
Mr Chichester , I can tell you that the report has been included on the order of business for the November part @-@ session in Strasbourg .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , Prime Minister , you made a fine speech .
Food additives
We have come in for some criticism from the WTO panel ; we now have a weapons agreement which we must adhere to and allow for .
It is called money .
I ask Parliament to give resounding support to this proposal , too .
Whoever is beaten will also have his role to play , and the winner will have to take this into account .
According to the United Nations Development Programme report , Montenegro is capable of fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals , including the eradication of poverty , universal primary education and a reduction in infant mortality , by 2015 .
The next item is the report ( ? 5 @-@ 0111 / 03 ) by Mr Morillon on the new European security and defence architecture - priorities and deficiencies .
I do not mean that everything here is not justified - but tell us the story .
I would like to thank the European Parliament and the Commission , which have accepted a set of important proposals from the Greek Government .
A Danish official is deprived of her brief and is marginalised for drawing attention to instances of maladministration , by which I mean what went on at Eurostat , to which our report makes reference .
Unfortunately , we do not have space for everything and that is why we were forced to vote against some of the amendments to the resolution .
I must say that I found this embarrassing .
People need to know about the value the euro adds in terms of growth and employment , in terms of lower credit interest , about the ways in which it benefits the EU ’ s stability and the good it does in the wallets and purses of ordinary members of the public .
It is relatively clear just why this is such a pressing matter : as Mr Cramer has already mentioned , there are currently , in Europe , over 20 different signalling and speed monitoring systems , the cost of which is measured , firstly , in space on board , not to mention money , and also , of course , maximises to the utmost the possibilities for error and ultimately constitutes a safety problem .
Let me cite just a few examples : its protracted recruitment process , its excessively long investigations , its failure to inform the Supervisory Committee as required , and above all the poor training and the failure to adequately respect the defence rights of the individuals under investigation .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin my prepared statement by thanking Commissioner Verheugen for discussing the subject of the Bene ? Decrees and thereby , as Parliament has already done in many resolutions , clearly pointing out that this issue very definitely possesses a European dimension .
For this reason I will be voting in favour of Amendments Nos 250 and 251 by Mr Arias Caete , Amendments Nos 256 , 257 , 259 , 261 and 268 by the GUE Group , Amendment No 273 by the ARE Group and the Green Group , and Amendment No 274 by the ARE Group and the I @-@ EDN Group .
– The next item is the continuation of the Commission statement on the Commission &apos;s legislative and work programme for 2006 .
As regards the financing of the trans @-@ European transport networks , its importance is universally recognized by us all .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
It is used for the public sector when it is aiming for change , development and ongoing renewal and when it needs to be able to change its methods of working to keep pace with accumulating experience .
Women pensioners are the worst off of all ; fully 25 % of women pensioners in the United Kingdom today live in poverty .
I firmly refute , therefore , the accusation that the Budgets Committee is blocking the posts necessary to improve security in Parliament .
A second important point appears to me to be the introduction of a sound supervisory system .
When the people have their say , their opinions are often wholly incompatible with the decisions taken over their heads by an elite unfamiliar with the real world .
( ES ) Madam President , Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten &apos;s report which we will be adopting today is a serious report , generally balanced , and also a demanding document .
We shall get the advances which the people of the Union deserve and the people of the Union have the right to expect .
B4 @-@ 0974 / 96 by Mrs Maij @-@ Weggen and Mr Moorhouse , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party , on the situation in Burma ; -B4 @-@ 0975 / 96 by Mr Telkämper and others , on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament , on the situation in Burma ; -B4 @-@ 0976 / 96 by Mrs Kinnock and Mrs Jensen , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on the European Union response to the situation in Burma ; -B4 @-@ 0978 / 96 by Mr Dupuis , on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance , on Burma ; -B4 @-@ 0982 / 96 by Mrs Baldi and others , on behalf of the Europe of Nations Group , on the situation in Burma ; -B4 @-@ 0984 / 96 by Mr Pettinari , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , on relations between the European Union and Burma .
The proposal in the resolution to convene a New Millennium Conference in which European partners and organisations would also participate and provide structures for such negotiations is , therefore , very important .
I also apologize to Mrs Flemming , but please understand that I am governed by the Rules of Procedure .
The days of the dictatorial and technocratic East are over .
Every week , we read at least two reports about this sad state of affairs .
These partnerships will have the positive and immediate effect of supporting the discussions on a multilateral climate change regime post @-@ 2012 .
Intense negotiations are currently being conducted with the candidate countries on these matters .
Up to birth and beyond , we do not develop into people , but as people .
I would call for entirely practical measures to be taken , as Mr Pronk does in his report and the Social Affairs Committee does as well .
In Finland we have developed the notion of &quot; age management &apos; , which means taking age differences in the staff into account when managing work .
Everything has been said and all the measures have been laid down , but what we now need to do is apply them .
If you will allow me , I would like to use the speech I am to make next as an opportunity formally to welcome our colleagues .
For those who came into this House in 1995 , I am referring to the area of the external offices which were performing many tasks for the Union .
All the evidence so far points to the fact that European industry is on the decline and is relocating beyond our borders .
The timetable is extremely tight ; practically each day counts , irrespective of the different dates advanced for the finalisation of the process .
UKIP has abstained on these two amendments and the final vote because , although we do not support any EU State aid laws because it should be up to national governments to decide on subsidy levels , giving greater flexibility to Member States and lengthening this period is beneficial and much more democratically accountable , putting power back in to the hands of governments to make these decisions .
Research funding in this area should be on a massive scale .
We also support the idea of a national ceiling on trade , and we want effective sanctions .
Mr President , it appears to be a platitude to say that European development depends on the youth of Europe .
Are there any comments ?
The Euro @-@ Flower is just one element of the broader environmental strategy that is needed to save our planet .
The Lisbon Treaty clearly recognises that humanitarian aid is a separate chapter of our international action and I feel that this should be reflected in an institutional structure .
I should like to finish off by addressing a few words directly to President Obasanjo , who once received the Liberals &apos; Freedom Prize for his work in aid of democracy in his country , and to urge him once again to make an effort on behalf of all Nigerians , including those who are homosexual .
But it can also be completely wrong . You may be applying such rules to people who would entirely reject the idea of being treated as a dependent worker , who are looking for and wish to have independence .
Fears have also been voiced regarding institutional matters , such as whether growth of the EDA would not result in a reduction in the size of certain Member States &apos; armies , and whether there would be a clash with the remit and objectives of the European External Action Service .
This peaceful Europe is our joint achievement but it is , therefore , all the more important to remember those who did not taste happiness and peace .
Nevertheless , we felt it was important to remind the Commission of the principles that should guide the consolidation of this sector , which is so essential to a robust and smoothly functioning European banking system and thus to the financing of our economy .
This was not the case 70 years ago when Europe was at war .
Nice is no use .
This is very important , as technical standardisation is something that , astonishingly , is frequently entirely misjudged in the mind of the European public .
I say that I welcome possible military action by NATO because I realise that a political solution , however desirable it may be , is becoming increasingly unlikely .
Madam President , Commissioner , the Commission &apos;s initiative on the reduction of methane emissions at European level is essentially correct and positive .
Secondly , in the transport sector we are working on it , and I hope that in the near future we will be able to make it a reality .
This is an important signal of unified international support for the government and people in their difficult task of working towards stabilisation and reconstruction .
According to the Treaty , in those areas where management is shared with the Member States , the Commission has the responsibility to supervise and ensure that national control systems are adequate .
Clearly that whole saga is very unsatisfactory .
Above all we must hope that others too - including the groups directly concerned - contribute to the European Union &apos;s culture . This is an important point .
Whether you support tax competition or harmonisation of tax rates , we all need this harmonisation of the tax bases .
That is one of the comments that I would like to make .
I doubt it .
This can double the available resources and also helps to unify research targets .
With the frankness that should prevail among friends , we have to recognise that our common history has its origin in the domination of one civilisation by another .
There is an even greater paradox in that the calendar adopted provides for 5 mini @-@ sessions to be held in Brussels in 2004 . In theory however , these should not be scheduled unless the agendas of the 12 normal sessions to be held in Strasbourg are full .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to say , by way of introduction , that I regret that it is so late in the day that we are dealing with topics of interest to young people .
Mr Belleré , you have the floor for five minutes .
( Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 163 ( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
It is surprising that those who defend an integrated and federal Europe should be destroying the only genuine common policy apart from the common fisheries policy .
The Commission &apos;s Agenda 2000 runs a similar risk , if the will to integrate the environment into other policies is not translated into measures , with timetables and penalties for transgressors .
Why , though , do we always have to keep repeating and reiterating these things ?
I am thinking , in particular , of the experiments that have been carried out in the Mont Blanc massif .
This is why I am looking forward to President Buzek &apos;s presidency with confidence .
The Commission will notify the Council and specialists in the field in the Member States of the contents of Parliament &apos; s report .
They are about a better quality of life and a better standard of living in every part of an enlarged Union , from our city centres to the heart of our rural and coastal communities .
Reorganising work in this way would ease congestion in access routes to major towns and would also allow us to eventually free up considerable human and financial resources that could then be used to concentrate on developing communications infrastructures in less @-@ favoured regions and in job @-@ creating sectors of activity .
As Parliament is aware of this , we will offer our full support .
It is time to put an end to this nonsense .
May I point out one error in the translation : &apos; municipalities &apos; has been translated as &apos; Städte &apos; in German .
The verdict on this must rest with those who are in a position to judge whether Serbia is cooperating fully , and that is prosecutor Brammertz .
In your opinion should this involve an initiative at international level , such as that which Sir Leon Brittan has been seeking for a long time ? Would you be in favour of this ?
This is certainly not helped by the accession countries , where we only have 14 % at the moment .
This will lead us , hopefully , to conclude at first reading .
All the projects concerned are suspended until the situation is clarified .
It will mean that a British citizen can be tried , convicted and sentenced in a foreign country without their presence in a court of law , and then removed to that country for imprisonment .
Having said this , it must be added that annual the reports are not sufficient for our Parliamentary work and our responsibility for monitoring and checking these funds .
There is a significant difference between the two amendments , however .
Mr President , on a point of order : I was somewhat astonished , at 1 p.m. this lunchtime , to learn of the existence of this application by the Greens .
Once all the rhetoric is cut out , it is just as simple as that .
In practice , this gives rise to the need for the European Union to define its own independent strategy so that , on the basis of this independence , it can redefine its relations with America and correct its mistakes . This redefinition is a sine qua non , because the axis of the Union &apos;s strategy must again rest on its relations with the USA .
We take the view that such data should be made available quickly .
Many states there have decided to take action .
. Mr President , I believe that we have done well to instigate this debate , because what Mr Frattini has told us is slightly different from what was initially announced and because you will at least recognise that , if such mysteriously named places – black sites , salt mines containing ‘ ghost prisoners ’ , etc . – do actually exist , then Article 6 of the Treaty and the Treaty itself would be given short shrift .
Those who hold the key to the Lisbon Strategy &apos;s success , namely the Member States , must come up with the resources to achieve the aims they have set .
Competition within the liberated markets must become more effective and competition authorities must be set up accordingly .
Firstly , how was it possible for a representative of the EU , François Léotard , to be appointed , who , in his very first statements , has already contradicted these principles and has put the terrorists on the same footing as the government ?
That concludes the vote .
It is important for such relations to be built on sound foundations .
The same commitment has been made by the Council of Europe and the European Commission .
Incomprehensible too because in 1986 - and I was there - the British Government signed the solemn declaration which the Council , Commission and European Parliament all gave to combat racism at both national and European levels .
- ( FR ) This report gives us the opportunity to welcome the European Parliament &apos; s becoming aware of the need to defend the banana producers of , on the one hand , the ACP countries ( to whom we have made commitments in the course of renewing the Lomé Convention ) and , on the other hand , the outermost countries of the Community .
If the state of the environment is to be improved , binding legislation still needs to be a priority .
Mr President , the process of European integration is slow , and calls for patience .
What is the proposed procedure ?
This does not , however , mean that everything is fine and that no criticisms should be made .
I totally agree with Commissioner van den Broek on the following : there must be no sidelining or overshadowing of the important issue of enlargement by the matter of TurkeyEuropean Union relations .
This assessment , which I hope is balanced , is the basis for the conclusions that I am recommending , and they are as follows : as things stand there is nothing to prevent a joint accession treaty – I repeat , a joint treaty – being signed for Romania and Bulgaria at the beginning of 2005 for accession in 2007 .
I am calling for criticism of the ECOFIN Council for undermining the Commission .
A number of EU high @-@ level visits to Belarus this year helped strengthen political exchanges .
Many of you have said that the economically most developed countries award the most aid .
This is obviously an important aspect influencing sustainable development which makes it possible , as some of you have stated , to export environmental technology .
So we are now waiting for the Commissioner to tell us whether the European Commission also approves Mr Castricum &apos;s excellent report .
It will certainly be a noteworthy occasion , as we will soon be going over Mrs Randzio @-@ Plath &apos;s report , which the Green Group in the European Parliament fervently supports .
After eating the mushrooms - this is still the dream - Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt was overtaken by dreadful spasms and taken to hospital , where she was saved by a stomach pump .
If we want the single market to work as well as it possibly can , then in the fast @-@ developing area of new media like the Internet and e @-@ mail , all consumers must be entitled to the same high level of protection in every Member State , irrespective of where a purchase is made .
Ladies and gentlemen , a European Union citizen is going to be killed , and we cannot turn a blind eye to this violation of every citizen ’ s foremost right , the right to life .
I regard such steps as clearly beneficial moves towards the Irish language .
The fact is , the aid requirements are greater than ever , especially in the areas of food security , the fight against climate change , education , health - in particular for HIV sufferers - and maternal and reproductive health .
Even if we hear nothing else , we know that is going in the right direction in terms of the reforms that we want to see .
The only social measures envisaged are retirement or hypothetical retraining plans .
We must get up a little bit earlier , as President Clinton has advised us .
Beyond historical and cultural , almost anecdotal divergences , or short @-@ term false calculations , there is no opposition of interests amongst Europeans on this subject .
Madam President , I take a rather more favourable view than the last speaker of Mr Pradier &apos;s report .
Both of these countries have also in common that the appropriate wage behaviour was underpinned by tripartite consensus @-@ based wage agreements and was accompanied by a reduction in the tax burden on labour.&apos;
The report calls on the Commission to present a comprehensive definition of territorial cohesion in the framework of the forthcoming Green Paper on territorial cohesion , and I can confirm that the Green Paper to be published at the end of September this year will contribute to the progress towards a common understanding across the Union of the concept of territorial cohesion .
This has always been an important objective for us .
My group is firmly convinced of this ; all the more so since there has been no mention of government funding in this concrete decision and the decision is also being dealt with in its entirety on the territory of the Republic of France .
In modern economies , innovation accounts for 70 @-@ 80 % of annual GDP growth .
It is your job , Prime Minister Orbán , to lead the European Union and , indeed , to encourage Member States to concern themselves with each other &apos;s business to some extent .
This instrument should permit effective taxation , which is necessary to combat damaging tax competition and help improve the functioning of the single market .
They have become one of the EU &apos;s top priorities .
Are there really so few grounds for suspecting that some of its advocates want to use Turkish accession to finally smother the founding fathers ’ conception of a European federal state ?
It is time to ensure that it is properly implemented .
Time is at a premium and I would like to highlight a couple of observations which are important , if not fundamental .
Socially : aid is unfairly distributed between countries , regions and farmers .
The Daphne programme is being discussed in the meantime , but as I recall , we in this House - namely 350 Members - supported calls for a European Year and a campaign to combat violence against women by signing the Declaration in May .
I am grateful for the Council &apos; s reply since it demonstrates that the Council cannot violate the principle of institutional autonomy by which we are governed .
&apos;How have you come to understand that ? &apos;
I refer , of course , to the winemaking sector , which accounts for tens of thousands of jobs in my region , southern France , and hundreds of thousands of jobs around Europe , and which is currently enduring a major crisis .
Unfortunately , today the revised CAP is being designed under the same conditions of competitiveness as the previous policy .
This is because I would like to continue to be given informed advice in the bookshop and not to pick from stacks of books like a fast @-@ food service .
All this must be transparent and accessible to whomever it concerns , in order to prevent the tendency for the economies of Africa to develop into various toxic waste industrial management sectors .
Ladies and gentlemen , I am extremely concerned about the issue of human rights in China , and not only China , since there are unfortunately problems in other countries which are closer than China .
Children who are exposed from an early age to the harshest physical demands lose not just their innocence and identity , they often lose their whole childhood .
This is also exceptionally important in the Council . Their discussions and votes should be made public .
The moment for such an assessment is particularly appropriate as President Lula &apos;s term in office approaches its end .
That is just one of the many reasons why the European Union needs to have its own diplomatic representation in Tehran .
Nonetheless , I should like to have seen even greater emphasis on the importance of policy integration ; that is to say the fact that growth initiatives must take place in forms in which careful consideration is given to the social and environmental consequences .
However , I am definitely against this .
. I should like to congratulate Mrs Laperrouze on her firm and timely recommendation for a second reading on the Council common position for adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down guidelines for trans @-@ European energy networks .
First of all , the idea of penalising terrorism at the International Criminal Court .
I am , therefore , extremely taken aback by what Mr Van den Berg , from the &#91; Dutch &#93; Labour Party , wrote in a letter published recently which stated , in so many words , that the Union &apos; s reform should no longer be a prerequisite for enlargement .
Efforts to strengthen the military power of the European Union are linked to the efforts to strengthen it in the imperialist competition and within the frameworks of competition between the war industries .
Firstly , how much to use depends on the hardness of the water .
But I believe it right to demonstrate that the hope of the British Government that it is possible to be both at the heart of European affairs and evade the resolution of British Membership of EMU is a dangerous illusion .
We are thus not performing self @-@ sacrifice here .
The report discusses the work in respect of the first and second pillars .
It should unite political forces that have that common objective of making a stronger Europe , a Europe that responds to the aspirations of its citizens .
As many speakers rightly emphasised , Europe needs a common civil protection force straight away , as Parliament has repeatedly requested .
I would therefore like to ask you to reassure me , if possible , that this law will not put oil processing companies that process Russian petrol at a disadvantage , and will consequently not put Central and Eastern European Member States in a discriminative situation .
The next item is the recommendation for second reading ( A6 @-@ 0377 / 2005 ) , by Mrs Wortmann @-@ Kool on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism , on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 1999 / 62 / EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures ( 9856 / 2005 – C6 @-@ 0274 / 2005 – 2003 / 0175 ( COD ) ) .
They also face difficulties when they want to build on previous education and training and move , for example , from vocational education and training into higher education .
Could it be that all this never happened ?
As Parliament has requested , the Commission will review the situation in a few years &apos; time .
There is no commitment to an early phase @-@ out of textiles and garment quotas because of strong resistance from the United States .
You read on and it starts talking about liberalising more of our public services .
It is also easy for professional criminals to avoid getting caught in the net .
The other candidate countries ( e.g. Cyprus , Turkey , Malta ) my also take part in LIFE when agreements permitting such participation are signed with these countries .
I would like first of all to congratulate Mr Trichet on the annual report he has just presented .
On the question of when the proposed legislation is to come into effect , I would say that I do not think that there is any argument , either technological or industrial , in favour of postponing the date when the lower limit values are to come into force .
I think Mrs André @-@ Léonard failed to stress it sufficiently , perhaps out of modesty .
Whatever our view of the kind of Europe we want to see , I think we must all welcome some of the important achievements of Europe in the past five decades .
This is a most timely report , on which I should like to congratulate Mrs Breyer .
The United States on 5 March enacted a law that has indisputable consequences for the citizens of the European Union , for data protection and for EU legislation .
I would ask the Commissioner actively to promote the EU , via the local EU delegation - under the excellent leadership of Leonidas - with the backing of local lawyers &apos; organisations , being given the opportunity of actively following these election tribunals - without any involvement of course , for that is not up to us - and to inform the Council and Parliament accordingly .
The migraine will disappear because we will have lost our heads .
This is the context in which we are operating , and , in this context , we want to point out the position adopted by the Italian Minister for Justice , who , after personally endorsing the European arrest warrant in the Council , stated that he finds it unconstitutional in form and an out @-@ and @-@ out mistake as regards content .
Finally , I wish to share with you today some of the most recent developments in the implementation of the strategy for Europe on nutrition , overweight and obesity @-@ related health issues , which respond to some of the actions called for in your report .
Why does the Treaty establishing the International Criminal Court , signed in Rome in July , still only have about 60 signatures ?
Madam President , we can no longer believe that one @-@ off adjustments are satisfactory .
To this end some countries are performing accounting contortions which are incompatible with the objectives of real convergence , which is a veritable time bomb under the solid character of EMU .
The MEDIA PLUS programme is not intended to reduce commercial risk related to the introduction of digital technology in any sector , including the TV sector , and that is why MEDIA PLUS is totally unadapted to radio broadcasting .
Regulation at single market level is required , that is to say that we need far more centralised regulation at European level .
Madam President , I would like to pick up on the points made by my colleague , Mr McMahon .
The special measures already mentioned do not involve reinventing the wheel ; other states , Japan among them , have also brought in programmes for reducing the CO2 pumped out by motor cars , which involves vehicles being divided up , in &apos; top runner &apos; programmes , into nine different weight classes and binding targets for reductions being laid down .
It is imperative that the LTTE is held to account for its actions and that further international pressure is brought to bear on it at this time .
Priority areas results are also to be focused upon : there must be a demonstrable impact on people &apos;s lives .
rapporteur . - ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is an honour for me to present to you my report on the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Community .
I regret the Commission &apos;s tacit acceptance of the collective irresponsibility of the majority of the Member States concerning financial management of the EU .
in writing . - ( FI ) This report was a victory for the advocates of Finnish and European agriculture .
This means that their full economic development is limited by the characteristics of their local economy and their geographical position .
The Commission does agree that it would have made for greater clarity to bring all the legislation on pesticide residues together in a single directive , or at least to codify the existing directives .
I should like to call on all those involved to be prudent , to make significant progress in respect of impact assessments , and to achieve whatever is necessary for all Community programmes to be fulfilled .
The chairmen of the Groups are here , as are the Members of this House – there could be more of them , but today ’ s turnout is more or less acceptable .
We cannot attempt to understand contemporary Russia without considering its attitude to the past .
Thank you , Mrs Gradin .
Mr President , let me come back to a few questions that have been mentioned .
I maintain that there must be a ceiling on the level of compensation to be paid in the event of the early repayment of loans .
This should also apply to Americans worldwide .
( FR ) Mr President , I would first beg you to excuse this disruption to the agenda , or more precisely to the order of precedence . A train breakdown between Paris and Brussels nearly took me out of Europe , but it has been put right now , thank you .
The failure of last week &apos;s Parliament @-@ Council Conciliation Committee meeting has caused significant concern throughout the European Union .
Now , I am naturally all in favour of making savings where this is possible , since there is no point in spending money for the sake of it , but ECU 62 m seems a very poor result compared with ECU 556 m .
But that number is of course now increasing , partly as a result of Iraq , and the number of people coming to the European Union because of extreme poverty - the people that we see coming to Malta , Lampedusa and so on - is a huge issue for this House and for the European Union .
We can talk as much as we want , but fine words are not enough .
The second point is the need to promote an integrated industrial policy : major European projects , the promotion of technology platforms , etc. must go hand in hand with territorial approaches in terms of territorial balance and consistency with employment policies , whether it be in the framework of the open coordination method or of more binding procedures , as Mr Langen seems to want .
Increasing the energy efficiency of buildings is definitely among the most important of them .
As is , unfortunately , confirmed by his recent statements rejecting the Annan plan , Mr Denktash ’ s strategy cannot be intended to do other than lead to a breakdown of bilateral negotiations .
Energy and clean water are the biggest problem areas here .
You mentioned the most relevant event yourself , Mr Barroso , namely the forthcoming talks in Brussels with the President of the United States .
It is astounding that , just two months after the new financial perspectives began , new expenditure is being proposed for them .
We are treated so well on the aeroplane , though , we like it so much , that we keep coming back and we keep being sent back to our country of origin.&apos;
Your report contains certain indications that your institution takes an interest in this issue , but I should like to ask a more general question .
The Israeli army general , himself a doctor , said that if an ambulance moved , they would fire .
It will see Protocol V to the convention , on &apos; Explosive Remnants of War &apos; - i.e. failed explosive ordnance , ammunition or sub @-@ munitions from cluster bombs , - enter into force .
The Commission must now ensure that all these good intentions are actually put into practice .
There is the slump in sales , 5 % since 1999 to be precise , the environmental burden against which Europe may have taken various , but insufficient , measures , as well as the powerlessness of the Member States to have any impact whatsoever on international company strategies .
Over the next few years , the majority of European workers are thus going to be under ever increasing pressure .
This is summed up by the kind of tinkering on the edges which characterises the re @-@ negotiated Convention .
By definition , trade can only take place when markets are opened and trade flows are , in effect , being liberalised .
( Laughter )
This is indeed one of our key concerns .
The rapporteur has done just that and that is a good sign .
We also think that quality is animal welfare and concern for the environment .
That is the situation we are in and it is that situation which my honourable friend Mr Cunha is at least trying to improve .
Our report therefore calls for a full , ambitious and balanced agreement based on three pillars : a political and institutional chapter reinforcing democratic dialogue and political cooperation ; a cooperation chapter promoting sustainable economic and social development ; and a trade chapter establishing an advanced free @-@ trade area with a broad agenda including , as well as reciprocal liberalisation of trade in goods and services , investment , public procurement , the protection of intellectual property rights , cooperation regarding competition and trade protection instruments , trade facilitation , and a binding dispute settlement mechanism .
It is genuinely our wish to pursue discussions , in particular within the Social Protection Committee , as well as to improve dialogue with the various stakeholders , both institutional and non @-@ institutional .
Dear Vice @-@ Presidents and honourable Members of this multi @-@ national democratic forum ,
( The House rose and observed a minute &apos;s silence )
We have seen on the front page of the Financial Times several times and heard from the head of the New York Stock Exchange that it is possible the US Sarbanes @-@ Oxley corporate governance rules could apply to the merged exchange , with jurisdiction in US courts .
I voted against this report , to which I have always expressed my strong opposition .
Switzerland had also organised such a referendum in September 2005 after the 2004 enlargement .
It smacks of lack of respect for the dignity of the species which governs this planet , even if it does fall into a thousand difficulties and errors .
. – Mr President , the report on batteries and accumulators has been adopted by a large majority in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety .
The report anticipates Ukrainian entry to the EU .
Similarly , the current negotiations should not be linked to the issue of the Union &apos; s finances after 2006 , these are separate issues .
The Commission accepts this position and will amend its original proposal accordingly .
In the White Paper , the Commission has also committed itself to improving its consulting procedures when drawing up policy proposals .
There are always new timetables , more percentages , new regulations and stipulations .
As far as this is concerned , I share Mr Lehne &apos; s view of assessing on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis whether harmonisation or mutual recognition of standards should be applied .
We were the first to make statements on both Tunisia and Egypt .
The products concerned may be sold on the European Union &apos;s market on the basis of multi @-@ annual agreements .
I would be glad to hear more about this .
Trade relations play a huge role , today . Arranging them in the right way would lead to economic growth in India and the development of the country , and would improve international stability .
This led to the unacceptable continuous culling , which was based on flawed scientific evidence , and the blinkered decision to reject vaccination .
This is why I am convinced that experience is best of all .
Ten Member States have not yet expressed an opinion and several of their leaders do not think they will do so .
The Chinese Government , for example , has created an Internet police force which checks whether any of the dozen or so million Chinese Internet users have infringed the network usage regulations .
This is also the case for Austria where Otto von Habsburg was required to deny his own identity and renounce rights belonging to him and to members of his family to enter Austria .
The Commission has not yet come to a decision on the request from the President of Parliament for it to publish a list of countries which prohibit the use of leghold traps .
We are progressing through the expenditure of a budget of ECU 1.8 billion . It is being used effectively .
I believe that the fact that we are carrying out a stress test at a European level with joint criteria is an extremely important and historic step forwards in the interest of the safety of all European citizens .
This answer with real content is very welcome .
However one looks at it , it would be better if Cyprus ’ accession on 1 May were agreed on the basis of a political solution to the conflict .
It is more difficult for us to maintain even and high rates of employment and to maintain stable state finances .
As a result of this war on the free press , numerous journalists are being dragged before the courts and many have been imprisoned or savagely fined .
I therefore believe that on the one hand the European Union must ask the Government to re @-@ establish as far as possible - because we must not lose sight of the fact that terrorism is a factor in Pakistan , a major factor - to re @-@ establish to some extent order and stability and constitutional rights and freedoms , and to release those people who have been unlawfully detained .
The EU can and must promote policies that work as incentives for the young .
Mrs Stauner &apos; s report lists our short @-@ term demands with respect to these conclusions and we all consider that they can be met by the stated deadline .
Member of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen of the Council , and , of course , ladies and gentlemen of this House , Mr Cappato , the Commission is very pleased with the attention paid by Parliament to the negotiation of a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Vietnam , as well as to the human rights situation in that country .
This debate aims at nurturing the review of the EU budget that the Commission has to undertake in the years 2008 and 2009 .
Freedom of expression and freedom of assembly are fundamental human rights for everybody , which the state has a duty to protect .
Surely - and I put this question to the Council presidency - part of the reason is that we continue to close our European market to them ?
It is not possible .
Secondly , I would like to emphasise the importance of a good approach to the transitional period , and in that respect we ask the Commission to be generous in favour of Parliament when reforming the comitology procedure , as defined in the acquis , to the new delegated and implementing acts , where the choice between the two procedures may be open to debate .
On the last point that you made with regard to the rules concerning excessive public deficits and the fact that proposals have been made to Italy , Portugal , Hungary and the United Kingdom , what about France and Germany ?
I congratulate you , Commissioner , on the energy strategy for the next 10 years .
At the same time , the repressive approach must constantly be balanced by boosting rights and freedoms , and this will give us one more political card with which to combat crime .
The impact of the crisis on the banks &apos; liquidity must also be examined .
We , as the Group Union for Europe , agree with the Council on the need to include in the list of priorities the fight against terrorism , fraud and organized crime and the importance of taking the necessary measures for Europol to take up its responsbilities in this area as soon as possible .
I am not sure whether any voluntary measures go far enough .
There would have to be alternatives , but surely it can be done .
As Mr Stevenson has quite rightly said , the sheep is an animal that is not of huge value , so all of this is not going to be done by veterinarians .
Nowadays , let us face it , the Joint Assembly is seen as an obstacle to free international trade by the dogmatisers in Geneva and Washington .
The intention to so is not new , of course .
The point is that we must send clear signals to Ukraine and to the other countries of the Black Sea region that are covered by the neighbourhood policy .
We must press the large reset button , as it were .
It is not just about energy or the environment ; it is also - and more pointedly - about the consequences of the rapid growth of information technology .
In the same way as I said before that we need to adapt to what was agreed in the Amsterdam Treaty in order to determine the rules relating to the issue we discussed a few moments ago , here Parliament &apos;s role is to go as far as the texts will allow .
The Commission is empowered to propose legislative measures to improve energy efficiency in the Union , and does intend to do so in the future , but only after other possibilities , such as self @-@ binding agreements with industry , have been exhausted .
In so doing it will confirm its credentials as a fully democratic and responsible country and one that respects human rights .
This is a treaty that will enable this Parliament to have greater co @-@ decision powers , that will make it possible to take decisions by qualified majority on some absolutely strategic issues and all within sectors where the fundamental rights of citizens will be given more attention and more protection : I am thinking of judicial cooperation and legal immigration .
Yet we - Europe - must take action ourselves if we have problems within the European Union .
Mr President , on 8 October the Territorial Association of East Prussia ( held its annual meeting .
It means more integration , not less integration .
You will need it .
Let us work to close the back door to illegal immigration more effectively by offering legal opportunities to those wishing to settle here and integrating them properly in our society .
The recent tragic events in August , when two Greek Cypriot demonstrators who were protesting peaceably against the occupation were murdered by the occupying forces , are being used by the Turkish side to promote the view that the two communities in Cyprus cannot co @-@ exist , and so frustrate efforts to unify the island .
Clear evidence has emerged that the police , the British army and intelligence services all colluded in his murder .
Well , on the basis of the noble ideas of peace , democracy and progress that everyone advocates , why not learn from the example of South Africa ?
We were aware of their concerns and finally , the reason behind them .
SOLVIT is an instrument that should and will gain in strength .
Finally , we also wish to support and encourage the Commission in this regard when we point to the need for any future consideration of urban transport to include a specific chapter on urban logistics .
I also congratulate Mr Barroso on the action he took yesterday to clamp down on energy giants in Europe , which are using their industrial muscle to hinder competition and distort the market .
I believe that we have to be faithful to Lisbon and Gothenburg in our approach and in our seeking sustainable production methods in Europe , which will induce growth and employment , founded upon the ecological bases of our existence .
Although we welcome networks of excellence and integrated projects , we must maintain more familiar mechanisms at the early stages .
It will bring about speedier improvement in the industry .
What form of energy will provide , over the next 30 years , stable and sufficient supplies of energy at relatively low prices , because this is important for the EU economy and its citizens ?
There is no need to hold a summit in order to determine a strategy for Africa .
For once the pressure from Morocco has not triumphed , as it has on other occasions .
Mr Patten raised these aspects and I hope his words will very soon be followed by deeds .
1 .
The State must take on a new role in reordering and reorganising Portuguese woodlands , as well as in addressing today &apos;s climate @-@ related problems throughout Europe .
Most of them are women , in a ratio of 2 to 3 .
Parliament ’ s amendments neither improve nor help to clarify the Commission ’ s proposal .
Consequently , there is no longer any reason why they cannot integrate into this area of free movement .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there is a clear need for action on the issue of undeclared work in all the Member States , for there have not so far been many successes in combating it .
The Commission is currently evaluating the numerous proposals for plans submitted for funding in 2003 .
Otherwise , I welcome the report which globally supports the actions of the Commission in innovative financing , in particular , in the area of carbon tax , euro project bonds and development financing .
Mr Søndergaard , I can confirm on behalf of the Presidency that the Council was indeed invited to attend the debate on this item .
Some of these will be decided when it comes to their implementation .
Although they are not sufficient , the two vessels chartered by the Commission and other measures taken with regard to fishing for tuna in coastal waters were decisive in reducing tension and avoiding the sad events of 1994 .
– Mr President , I too would like to join in the expressions of gratitude to you , Madam Vice @-@ President , for the idea for the Single Sky was yours .
The transition to democracy and independence is never easy .
I hear that the intention is to have a message and I hear that you intend to do something to help those who suffer most .
Many thanks , Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit .
More generally , the economic , social and hence occupational role of the motor car is now being reviewed from top to bottom .
As I said in my question and as you have commented , many thousands of ordinary Iraqis out of the sight of the media are kidnapped every day .
Furthermore , I call on the Commission to adopt a decision , as soon as possible , on the compatibility of Italian Government provisions with European provisions as regards the dairy sector in relation to the Parmalatcase .
Although Romania still has the highest incidence of tuberculosis in Europe , the values for this indicator have seen a significant reduction in the last five years .
I am therefore calling on the Commission to take action here , too .
More than 5 000 of us gathered on the streets of Toulouse on Tuesday and more than 30 000 on Saturday , all shouting &apos; Never again &apos; .
Energy Efficiency Action Plan (
Therefore , Mr President , I think that in tomorrow &apos;s vote we will convene another meeting with the Council to be held in July .
( FI ) Mr President , it is intolerable that commercial interests should have drawn the longer straw in relations between the EU and China and that the insistence on respect for human rights and democratic development has been more or less put in the role of cordial greetings .
Does he think it is morally correct ?
The number of armed attacks also rose by 200 % overall .
Mr President , yesterday , many members of our House met the representatives of the Interim Council of Libya , whose message was absolutely clear : they need international support and aid and they need it very quickly .
After all , we are in favour of rapid enlargement , are we not ?
Unfortunately , they are no longer with us , but they had the courage to press ahead , invest in the future and attain an achievement of some kind .
The big problem is competition between road and rail .
As Commissioner Barrot indicated a moment ago , first of all , Regulation 725 transposed the Code on international ship and port facility security – the ISPS Code – into rules that are binding upon the EU .
According to our information , the Romanian judiciary has deleted the Socialist Labour Party , which has 110 000 members and was represented in parliament until recently , from the list of recognised political parties in its country .
I made a speech that had been prepared for me , but I have to say that I may well have been misunderstood .
These rules are very restrictive and some of the countries believe they are excessively so .
I support the calls made by the resolution &apos;s authors for Kiev to continue to modernise energy supply infrastructure and to implement projects for the diversification of energy sources alongside EU Member States .
I repeat that the Council of the Union is not involved in this issue in any way whatsoever .
The third element is undoubtedly more political , and is also an aspect that my political group holds dear , namely that the plea that some people make for structural reforms without accompanying it with a strategy for boosting growth is likely to fail , as there can be no structural reforms without genuine support for growth .
The report therefore has my backing .
We , the European institutions – Parliament , the Council and the Commission – have to do it together .
I noted that you asked this question in your report .
The sub @-@ ceilings for loans to these countries anticipated by the EIB for the years 2007 @-@ 2013 - EUR 8.7 billion for Mediterranean countries and only EUR 3.7 billion for Eastern countries and Russia - appear to be unfavourable from the point of view of Eastern European countries in the sense of being disproportionate to their needs .
The European Union should be giving particular support to the development of the transport infrastructure and its interconnection with the main European transport routes in the countries which have joined the EU in recent years .
In this context , I should also like to emphasise that the European Parliament must , under the decision @-@ making process that leads to the adoption of Community acts , call for the clarity of texts , simplified procedures and , when appropriate , mechanisms that ensure the effective management and evaluation of the act in question .
As rapporteur for Life + , I will be unable to agree to this programme – which is already well and truly dwindling away – serving as an insurance policy for disasters that are less and less the result of nature .
That is the least that can be expected .
There is a lot of business secrecy involved in making decisions on loans and , as I said in my reply , it can be divulged to outsiders only with the express consent of the opposite party .
I would first like to thank all those who have taken part in the debate .
The Commission must understand that and respond to that expectation .
In addition , completely or partially excluding journalists from the scope of the directive would mean harmonising the definition of &apos; journalist &apos; at Community level , not a very easy task and something we do not wish to do .
I hope that we will succeed in putting it into effect on a wider scale , making even more efficient use of funds .
Working conditions vary , as do the prospects for young researchers and for their transition from academic studies to the job market .
In June 2003 , I asked the European Commission for clarification on the subject of plans to make it compulsory for Member States of the EU to use geological disposal sites for the permanent disposal of the most hazardous forms of radioactive waste from 2018 .
At that time I highlighted the specific problems of Charentes .
The biggest terrorist attack to date against the civilised world took place three days after the Durban Conference .
We knew that the different fusion associations held different views .
I recently spoke at a conference in the senate in Prague when this issue was being debated .
We have here the notion of shared immigration , of each party enriching the other .
Monitoring has undoubtedly proven its worth as a method that helps us to make progress .
. The Commission has of course not allowed this very important issue to disappear from view .
The quotas which the Commission itself has imposed on Bulgaria are restraining agricultural production , while the land in Bulgaria is going to waste .
The gas directive , which is something the Dutch presidency is interested in , might also have to be written off , since it is based on much the same principles as the electricity directive .
This was before the Conference of Presidents had their meeting .
Mr President , it has been over a year since King Gyanendra of Nepal seized absolute power .
Where bananas were concerned , complete liberalisation was postponed until 2006 .
Madam President , I would ask you to examine , as a matter of urgency , whether this European Parliament is a platform for speeches that repeat the same thing time and again , the selfsame thing for which Mr Le Pen has been cited .
Cadmium is being phased out . In this respect , the Green Paper is in fact outdated .
The European Union strives to place the protection of human rights at the heart of its policies , but still has a good deal of ground to cover .
If it transpires that by means of stem cells , defects and injuries of the human body can be corrected , then it is short @-@ sighted to rule out this alternative in advance .
Leopards do not change their spots .
When is that going to improve ?
I also congratulate it on the decision to appoint Javier Solana as the Union ’ s Foreign Minister once the Constitution has come into force .
Even though what we have here is a minimum directive , many of us in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are in favour of stringent rules governing all advertising in children &apos;s programmes and advertising aimed at children .
These inferior products on the market are cheating consumers and bringing herbal medicines into disrepute .
I am wholly in agreement with liberalisation .
I should be very happy if the European Constitution had already come into force , because it gives the European Commission wider powers than those it currently possesses .
She asked me to stress this point which we have included in the report : it is about the importance for Africa of developing its own strategy towards China , noting that such a strategy can enhance the reciprocal nature of trade relations between China and Africa if it is focused on greater participation by African workers in Chinese projects in Africa , greater willingness on the part of China to transfer technology , and better access to Chinese markets for African exports .
The British Government squandered a golden opportunity to achieve a fairer distribution of rural development funds and allowed certain Member States , even at that early stage , to allocate for themselves substantial sums of the already reduced amounts .
This is a widening of choice .
This seems logical , and may I ask you on behalf of the rapporteur to approve this amendment , tabled on behalf of the PPE _ DE Group .
As some speakers have mentioned already , we are at the moment talking about both long @-@ term policy - which could be referred to as the Lisbon policy , 2010 - and short term policy , and , in the short term , we are facing a recession , as we were reminded a moment ago .
Disregarding the criticism of the European Parliament , it makes no assessment of the progress achieved , the problems encountered , or the shortcomings still to be remedied , even though Article D itself requires the Council to generate the impetus required for the Union &apos;s development .
I am actually quoting Swedish experts .
If the provisions of the Nordmann report are applied - and I say if they are applied - we will see that there are three types of Members in this House : those whose parliamentary activities are their only source of income , those who also have another profession or paid job , and those for whom none of this is enough and who feel they need sponsorship as well .
It is for people themselves to run their own businesses ; that is a function we shall most certainly not be taking from them .
Under the anonymous European tendering procedures , these trust @-@ based relationships lost their value in one fell swoop .
You mentioned some programmes for developing those trust measures .
So now , Commissioner , at second reading we are down to the last few details .
Never before has the Nordic passport union been so threatened as it is today by this arrangement .
If nobody is opposed , the name of that delegation will be changed as I indicated .
In five years &apos; time , genetically modified organisms will be everywhere , in our vegetables and cereals , all in the name of the sacrosanct globalization of trade .
I believe that changes towards simplifying the procedures must not only be viewed in the light of the current crisis , but must also , in the long term , facilitate access to the European Union &apos;s solidarity instruments .
I personally have been hoping for a compromise all this time .
The example he gave was the word &apos; free &apos; .
The EU and the British Government should ponder Jeremy Bentham &apos;s philosophy that we should look for the greatest good for the greatest number .
That is what we expect from you .
The directive also deals with the rights of adoptive parents in those Member States in which adoption leave is recognised .
It is essential that the report is published in full forthwith so that the House has the full facts concerning this matter .
The right to vote is the most important of all citizens &apos; rights , as it allows people to participate in the most direct way possible in shaping the course of politics .
Those concerns are often over the impact of liberalisation on specific communities that are heavily reliant on particular industries .
It now claims that Member States are entitled to reunify unmarried couples .
As regards the report of the Wise Men , I think the conclusion that the Commission has totally failed in its duty is a little too black and white .
There has been progress between the Foreign Ministers of the Member States which I believe our public opinion considers to be insufficient .
I believe it to be equally important for the monitoring process , which has been agreed , to be implemented utterly openly and with the utmost rigour , so that we do not face problems at the end of it all .
I voted in favour of the report relating to the new draft budget for 2011 because it strengthens funding in areas that have been defined as priorities by the European Parliament , such as education , innovation , competitiveness and cohesion for growth and employment , as well as the conservation and management of natural resources .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by thanking you . I thank you for this debate , for your generally positive reception and for having expressed different points of view .
2 .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council and Sir Leon Brittan for their report and the insight they have given us .
The Commission , however , clearly states in its report that it is unlikely that terrorists would ask to exercise the right to asylum .
Now , I shall ask if there is a speaker in favour of the proposal .
That is why it is very good that the text has solid foundations based on altruism and voluntary donation and requires the Member States to adopt very strict procedures for the whole endeavour .
We need someone who can put the &apos; European &apos; back into the European Council .
We are referring to pressure on the African , Caribbean and Pacific Group of States ( ACP States ) to conclude an agreement within the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) or the EU &apos;s Economic Partnership Agreements ; the EU is seeking to use the impact of the economic crisis to impose these .
While indeed there may be an issue with regard to the protection of workers &apos; health - we have legislation in this area already , such as on exposure to electro @-@ magnetic radiation - we cannot ask , as we did in paragraph 7 , that Member States , where smoking bans already exist , respect the principle of equality between different types of establishment in the hospitality sector .
Finally , you will understand if I again express unanswered concerns about social justice and economic cohesion .
We take the reform and development of the external service very seriously .
There is great scope for improvement , and the resolution adopted by this House is intended to provide an initial response along these lines .
In a more distant future , Bulgaria will not be able to make the economy of reforms worthy of this name and even bring the country out of economic slump , with its fate of exclusions and social destitution .
Through the commitment of Commissioner Füle and others , the EU has shown that Albania does not have to face its problems alone .
That brings to an end the speeches by the Group spokespersons .
Mr. Dimitrakopoulos , not only am I able to pronounce your name , but I respect you as a colleague from the Foreign Affairs Committee .
The Chinese authorities are currently implementing a policy of ‘ patriotic education ’ , and forcing Tibetans to sign declarations in which they reject the Dalai Lama as their spiritual leader and acknowledge that Tibet is part of China .
For this reason , it should be stated explicitly that the process of abolishing visas , of opening up on the basis of established conditions , is a very positive one , which makes a positive contribution to our relations with societies in the East .
I am not at all opposed to the People ’ s Republic of China and even less so to the Chinese .
Moreover , many people would consider , as regards the effects of liberalisation in areas such as rail transport – for example in a country with which you are familiar – or in areas like energy and electricity , that it is not entirely apparent that it is absolutely necessary to make competition rules alone the be all and end all of the system .
But it will only be completely successful on one condition : that you do not stop in midstream .
This report proposes a range of measures relating to education and the training of teachers and trainers , codes of conduct and information on illegal or suspicious activities on the network .
Regarding the state of play , the South African side has always been very much concerned about its neighbours .
He will probably have to spend quite some time in negotiating with representatives of both the parties but I think it is important that he has our support as well as the support of the other American states for these particular efforts .
They do not have any other clout apart from solidarity .
On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , I should like to say that we are very satisfied with the conciliation achieved .
This rule allows the Commission to set levels of duty which reflect the actual damage being suffered by EU industry rather than the level of dumping established in the investigation .
This support was wide @-@ ranging in many respects .
A narrow understanding of the interests of the old Union threatens the cohesion of the whole European Union .
Lastly , I should like to point out a small inaccuracy in Amendment No 18 .
In the event of the Statute entering into force in 2009 , I very much hope that this defect will have been , by that date , remedied by means of a rule on the immunity of MEPs that shall be binding , equal and uniform across the EU .
Belarus
This does not mean , however , that the EU should be a passive member of the international community .
There has to be an interim period to allow all parties involved to adapt to the new circumstances .
It postponed entry into force by more than 10 years , and would double the number of days when limit values for pollution can be exceeded , from 30 to 55 a year .
Therefore , our proposal says that the stricter of the two regulations should apply .
I believe that genetic engineering is an intellectual technology , a technology of the future , with special significance for medicine .
As an argument in favour of his appointment it is now being said that , unlike the government in his country , he will adhere strictly to the 3 % ceiling for national budget deficits in the Stability Pact .
What have been the essential objectives of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries ?
We would all rather read about more great successes on its part on the market than about losses and layoffs , but the fact is that the European aerospace industry operates on a global market characterised by sharp competition and has to cope with well @-@ prepared competitors - Boeing , for example - in all its segments , so the industry needs constant investment and innovation if its products are to meet its customers &apos; requirements .
What is more , the world has changed .
There is a real tragedy : its name is water . The right to access to water is already being denied and is likely to be denied more and more for millions of people .
So I do not understand why the Council and our governments do not make more effective use of this instrument .
UN inspectors in Iraq are due to report back to the United Nations Security Council at the end of the month with their findings as to whether or not Iraq is in possession of weapons of mass destruction .
A greater number of men must make themselves heard at workplaces in the public debate and refuse to go along with this violence .
It incorporates the fundamentals of the antisocial measures implemented in other countries , like Greece and Ireland , as well as those included in the &apos; Euro Plus Pact &apos; imposed by the European powers .
Since we took three years to reach this compromise , I would like to point out that the Council and Commission cooperated particularly effectively here .
I consider very important the observation that the economic and financial crisis and the climate change crisis have the same roots .
Emboldened by high oil prices , President Chávez is looking for followers and allies in other countries , he is making a lot of noise in international forums and he is intervening in the sovereign affairs of his neighbours .
This kind of policy has not been adopted in Spain or other places , and in some countries , how to react to illegal immigration is being considered .

The current system for laying down guidelines on research and for channelling funds towards individual research projects is heavily exploited by those Member States that are largest in economic terms .
In the Baltic countries , any future Member States of the European Union , the legislation , the development of ports and of traffic structure require a good deal of work .
So we need to have a more flexible instrument which reflects the specific positions of European Union regions .
We are talking about significant amounts of money here .
According to him , Article 25 does indeed provide that a Member State can declare itself unable to take in these persons , but it will have to justify that declaration and the justification must be genuinely exceptional .
Madam President , the information society that is so much talked about is not a natural disaster befalling us poor defenceless human beings .
These waves are all around us , bringing undeniable benefits , which I do not for a moment question in this report , but also , it has to be said , giving rise to serious questions with regard to their impact on our health .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , these three reports - by Mr Fava , Mrs Sanders @-@ ten Holte and Mrs Maes - were adopted by very large majorities in committee .
Now that we have a real probability of having the Lisbon Treaty finally ratified and the whole process completed , we can turn our attention to the work to implement the Treaty .
In the present situation , I am therefore sceptical about the idea of a European prosecutor , which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty .
Question No 60 by Christine Crawley ( H @-@ 0453 / 96 )
As we know , the profit from these shares will ultimately always be generated through the prices of telephone calls .
I hope that this will become more widespread in the weeks and months to come .
With regard to the first section , we must admit that although the directives in question have been transposed , in some cases painstakingly , into national legislation , many obstacles remain , which must be overcome by adopting a raft of specifically @-@ targeted measures .
On the other hand , the 2012 budget is , in a sense , the &apos; little brother &apos; of the European governance package , but it must provide economic support for the political package .
It could have been finished as far back as 1997 , but even though it is late , it could at least have clarified the wording of certain articles of the directive and defined the many undefined concepts which have given rise to numerous interpretations .
At the beginning of the summer , the people of Europe gave a clear signal that they were unhappy with the way in which Europe was heading .
The President of the Commission has the floor , I would apologise to him for the delay .
We need energy in infrastructure , the energy equivalent of fast trains , super grids and high @-@ tech smart grids are needed , and we have the money for this .
In so doing they proved those who believed that the proletariat has no fatherland to be mistaken .
We also know that the Council has failed to meet the expectations of the European Parliament as regards the reclassification of certain priority substances as priority hazardous substances and as regards other important areas .
These are the rules that we must bring to bear .
Among these , those who use inland waterways represent just a small minority .
The European Union wishes to see Tunisia maintain and develop its security and its prosperity .
This is the subject of the vote and I hope I shall have your support tomorrow .
Let us therefore start by ceasing to act like imperious advisors and dictating the rhythm and nature of Russia &apos;s reforms .
As regards the furnishing of our offices , our Quaestors - may I greet the ones here today - held a meeting on Wednesday and decided that all the offices will be equipped with file cabinets on castors with three lockable drawers .
We start to offload our own responsibilities onto the shoulders of the European institutions .
In other words , when can I get my first document out of the Council ?
rapporteur . - ( LT ) I would like to say that the text before us is a compromise , which has been reached through complex negotiations between the Council , the Commission and Parliament .
They have not understood a thing , for teaching someone a lesson is a dismal way of educating them and one that has never worked .
Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on producing an excellent report .
These issues mainly include , by way of example , numerous accusations of torture chambers in the country , references to arbitrary arrests and practices of detaining people without judicial proceedings in south @-@ eastern Turkey , contradictory judgments in relation to the punishment of those guilty of torture , court cases which demonstrate that there is still no uniform interpretation and application of provisions relating to the freedom of expression , and the regime concerning religious foundations and communities , which remains particularly restrictive .
My country stands accused of &apos; typical German angst &apos; - quite unfairly in this case .
We are extremely prudent .
Mr Miller produced a very interesting report , with much of which I disagreed .
Among other things , politics is about symbolism , and the fact that Parliament decided to vote on this issue at a time of major crisis for the European institutions is not something that I welcome or applaud .
Socrates is one of the bestknown Community programmes ; its activities are right in line with the needs of our people and directly touch their lives .
As for next year , I would ask - and I am grateful to you for saying how very useful you , too , find this - that we should try for a bit more transparency next time around , but there is one thing that will not be possible , for the Chamber was packed out with 580 young people in it , and if we invite all the Members of this House , there will not be enough space .
&apos; Persistent cases of torture , disappearances and the Turkish record in combating terrorism in the south @-@ east . Turkey needs to exercise restraint , to make greater efforts to uphold the rule of law and human rights and to find a civil , and not a military , solution .
The security forces evacuated the settlers sensitively but with resolve and determination .
For that to happen , however , all of our countries must adopt a number of measures to encourage private investment and , in particular , we must ensure that the red tape of the European Commission and the consequences thereof do not add to the red tape that already exists in each of our countries .
It will be resumed after the debate on the European Council meeting of 23 May 1997 .
The international community is now taking action to make the leaders in Belgrade put an end to the suppression , allow the return of refugees and accept the presence of an international force .
I believe that cities have every opportunity to lead the way towards a sustainable energy future .
In addition , it is not clear what it takes for a substance to be declared so hazardous that it has to be banned completely .
It is absolutely wrong .
However , should this not be carried through within a reasonable period of time , contrary to expectations , in other words by the end of this year , then we should not just raise a warning finger , as was the case with the vote in the Committee of Inquiry , but would really be obliged to hold a vote of censure pursuant to Article 144 of the Treaty .
However , does a substantial part of the responsibility not also lie with the Kosovan terrorists who want to change the borders and separate Kosovo from Serbia ?
We have a useful tool , we must use it to improve coordination .
It has seized our initiative to draft a report on the discriminatory effects of pay differentials and other inequalities on women &apos;s pensions and on the trend towards the individualisation of social security rights .
We must provide a clear response to the citizens &apos; demands for the EU effectively to confront the problem of the increasing threats crime poses for their freedom and rights by means of a solid and common policy for preventing and combating crime .
I should like to change the wording of ‘ whereas on 12 November 2005 another opposition leader , Nurkadilov Zamanbek , ’ to ‘ ’ .
- Before the vote :
I would be interested in finding out about this , because companies have come to me in the past with their concerns .
There are detailed debates and discussions on this subject , including some with Commissioner Bangemann .
The agreement reached at the European Council clearly reflects the EU &apos;s determination to use all the tools at its disposal and to do its best to prevent the crisis from jeopardising our long @-@ term objectives , particularly in terms of energy security and the fight against climate change .
I believe that that practice should be stopped .
I am given to understand , Madam President , that you too have it in mind to submit a proposal to this end .
They are left without a job , without social or financial support .
I do , however , believe in ultimately raising landfill standards to a level where they can be compared .
This is the new directive , of course , and I am pleased that it has been extended to offshore workers , fishermen and doctors in training .
We have a common pot of funding .
&apos;Sorry , this has certainly not been classified information for two years , but you cannot be given it.&apos;
But in terms of the Court it is important to get away altogether from the system of appointments by nationality .
Restricting pornography that uses or targets children should not be seen as an affront to true freedom .
I am particularly pleased that Commissioner Busquin has upgraded the work of his directorate @-@ general in this matter to the status of a unit , that he is ensuring that statistics are being kept , and that networks which help and encourage women scientists are being supported by the European Union .
The presidency is well aware of the number of problems which persist . These need to be addressed , otherwise the insecurity concerning Russian gas via the Ukraine will linger on .
It is discrimination against the local authorities and civil organisations in the new Member States .
At the beginning of the year , the European Banking Authority announced that it would be carrying out a separate thematic review of the liquidity risks in the EU banking sector as part of its regular risk assessment cycle in the first quarter of 2011 .
Secondly , we need , for the future too , clarification in the Rules of Procedure as to what is to happen in cases such as this .
With this in mind , the report proposes a public debate on the Union &apos;s policies , to be initiated by the European Parliament which , by bringing together rulers , elected representatives and social players , would put them in a position where they could hold joint discussions .
Any proposals will need the approval of Member States .
It was not a good day for relations between the smaller countries and the larger ones , and it was not a good day for the forthcoming enlargement .
The question is this : why , if there are such difficulties , can we not make use of some fund or other , as was done with the Galileo project , to turn this project into a reality ?
It is one of the many results of omnipresent consumerism .
Nor do we understand why , in category 2 , you have reduced payment credits even though there might be several technical justifications for them .
The collection of information is important to prevent awful atrocities , such as those we have seen in Madrid .
Worst in this respect were threats by German politicians like PSE chairman Martin Schulz against Poland and Great Britain .
A young person from the Maghreb cannot .
This should be taken as read , but this was not the case in the past .
A programme reviewing the general conditions for cofinancing is currently under way within the Commission .
You talk of changes to the pension system in order to preserve social cohesion .
That is why , as I mentioned , now that we are living in an ever more electric and electronic world , the proposal which is on the table today and which you will debate later , is extremely important for dealing with these questions .
The second point taken up by Mr Oostlander and Mr Barón Crespo is that we must seek a strategy with the central and eastern European applicants for entry so that after a first wave of enlargement it would not turn out that the prosperity gap between the European Union and the countries which do not belong to it is not just pushed , in a sense , a few hundred kilometres eastward .
It is now up to the Member States &apos; governments to take the initiative provided by this report , and I urge the Dutch presidency to examine this issue as a matter of some urgency .
Lastly , everyone would agree that we need to amend the regulation on the financial instrument for fisheries guidance under the CFSP , in to order make aquaculture eligible for subsidies for young people &apos;s start @-@ up , for small and medium @-@ sized businesses , for promoting the quality of fishery products , for promotional campaigns for their consumption , for establishing environment @-@ friendly practices , etc , etc . This , then , is my appeal to the Commission , in the person of Commissioner Solbes Mira : - and I am sorry that Commissioner Franz Fischler is not here - please do not allow this matter to fall into oblivion and please adopt effective measures to promote the aquaculture sector even more and with an eye to the future .
It expects 2008 to be a year of progress .
I am surprised that we cannot manage to find an alternative way to deal with the Turkey issue , particularly within the context of this harmonised list .

At the request of Mr Cox , I should like to welcome Mr Dedaj , chairman of the Liberal Party of Kosovo and Vice @-@ President of the Kosovo Parliament , who is present with us in the official gallery .
Excessively close cooperation - particularly on the purchasing side - between such large chains jeopardises free competition and the consumer &apos;s freedom of choice .
We have now finally reached the point at which we have perhaps obtained some control over , and put an end to , the chains of infection which we know exist in this connection .
We think about the history of the Mediterranean , a history that is inseparable from the history of Europe .
. However paradoxical it may seem , it is at moments of suffering overseas that EU Member States manage to speak with one voice on the international scene – the voice of solidarity .
Secondly , with regard to the question of junior doctors in training , it was unfortunate that when the original working time directive was proposed by the Commission , this sector was excluded .
Mr President , I would like to say a few brief words to Parliament , because I am very surprised at the behaviour exhibited by the Chairman of our Committee when yesterday evening he sent everyone an email relating to the vote on my report .
Thirdly , concerning the Seville Conclusions , I would draw your attention to the fact that the Commission has already presented to the Council the proposal on mandates for new readmission agreements with the People &apos;s Republic of China , Albania , Algeria and Turkey .
The charter of the Territorial Association of East Prussia demands that part of Poland ’ s territory be seized , and the Polish Government is regarded as an interim government .
And what have such loans done for the European economy ?
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in the resolution that it will adopt tomorrow , Parliament will welcome the positions taken on credit rating agencies , which aim to increase transparency and to strengthen cooperation between the national supervisory authorities .
In the meantime , one country which has much greater problems than Portugal and Spain , namely the USA , remains completely untouched by the war that the speculators are waging on the euro .
Yes , we need to help the poorest people more , but we need to do it where they are , and in our mutual interest .
Mr President , the joint debate of these three reports is an important debate .
The assimilation of the EEAS as an institution allows it to have budgetary autonomy and gives it the power to deal with its own administrative expenses , subject to the discharge to be made by Parliament .
What is the current state of affairs ?
That is to say that , to use the American terminology , he belongs to a political group which is more &apos; pro @-@ business &apos; than &apos; pro @-@ market &apos; .
One Member is able to speak in favour of the proposal and one against .
However , we must expect Member States to demonstrate political will and reflect on our position in a constructive way .
The Commission looks forward to using the new Northern Dimension policy to provide added value in a forum embracing Russia , Norway and Iceland in order to meet the many challenges facing the northern part of our continent .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , it is , of course , a real pleasure for me to be able to address you in this capacity .
( The House rose and observed one minute &apos;s silence )
This is a hugely ambitious goal and 2010 seems a long way away but , considering the time frames for the various changes to structure and infrastructure , we can say that we are already extremely behind .
We gaze down from Brussels and Strasbourg on events in Sudan , despite the fact that the European Union arose from a political and moral protest against crimes of that nature .
Furthermore , it was the view of the informal meeting of Foreign Affairs Ministers in Klosterneuburg in the spring that the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay should be closed as quickly as possible , so the Union has clearly expressed its opinion on the subject .
The project concerns research into the causes of discrimination and the search for effective anti @-@ discrimination measures .
I would like to remind everyone that , when debating the &apos; telecom package &apos; , Parliament approved by a large majority the fact that we should demand an open , common standard for TV transmitters and receivers , the only one so far approved in Europe and known as the MHP standard .
The next item is the debate on the report ( A5 @-@ 0026 / 2004 ) by Mr Cercas , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the organisation of working time ( revision of Directive 93 / 104 / EEC ) ( 2003 / 2165 ( INI ) ) .
Today , the more important element of choice and political will has been added .
Then there would be the individual segment directives on low voltage , machinery , medical devices , and , if appropriate , on high voltage and so on .
Mr President , I would first of all like to thank the British presidency for their participation in the peace process in Ireland .
As I understand it , one must be present in the chamber even when submitting a written explanation of vote .
If we keep unanimity we will not be able to reach common positions and this is one of our demands .
There is talk of infertility , but nothing is said about abortion being the main cause of falling population numbers in Europe .
Well , I am all for free trade .
I am not naïve .
As I have said at committee meetings , it is still my intention to give the Community patent one last try during my term of office .
The historic change brought about by electing the charismatic and very active President Sarkozy is indisputably positive .
All of us in the Liberal Group are in agreement with that .
The Commission certainly knows that it has traditionally taken a proactive approach and has adopted several decisions under Article 81 prohibiting restrictive agreements between the pharmaceutical companies and the wholesalers aimed at impeding parallel exports .
To date , no Council presidency has been able to contribute to surmounting those difficulties , because the Member States have always agreed on the lowest common political denominator .
I share the rapporteur &apos;s view on this and as a result I think that the European Commission should take notice of indicators that better reflect the immediate significance of directives for businesses and citizens .
I look at my electricity bill , I look at it with interest because I want to make these savings , and frankly I find it confusing .
I should therefore like to move that we adjourn this debate and begin the debate on competition , as suggested , so that the Members concerned with the beef question can speak in the presence of the competent Commissioner .
The volcanic eruption in April highlighted to us that traffic in European airspace is not prepared with an appropriate response in the event of unexpected disruption .
The financial sector has shamelessly allowed itself to be bought out of the crisis by taxpayers , but we are now being asked to deny help of this kind to Greece .
In a joint declaration with the European Parliament , special attention has been paid to the protection of animals during transport .
Firstly , one has to have a realistic work programme ; secondly , one has to be able to negotiate dynamically and reach compromises ; and , lastly , one has to fully involve the European institutions , starting with Parliament , and take an approach to outstanding issues that is free from constraints and national interests .
These are rather general , rather violent , and rather boorish opinions .
It is now up the Commission and the Member States to take the initiative to correct this and to ensure that commitments are fulfilled .
I hope that the EU in particular will try to encourage the United Nations - which at this very moment is undertaking reforms - to respond to events in the problem areas of the world .
To use medical terminology , I have heard a lot about diagnosis but not a lot about the cure .
The most important task aid agencies have is to make themselves unnecessary , all the while ensuring that the work is leading to local action and prosperity .
Obviously , there exists a mutual but asymmetrical interdependence in energy supply between the EU and Russia .
Scrutiny of European Agricultural Guarantee Fund financing ( codified version ) ( vote )
In that spirit , we can fully endorse Amendments Nos 2 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 20 , 30 , 33 , 37 and 41 and we can partially accept Amendment Nos 4 , 5 , 6 , 10 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 26 , 28 , 31 , 35 , 38 and 40 providing some slight verbal modifications .
The notion , current in recent years , that consumers are indifferent to the ingredients from which vodka is produced is misconceived .
We are not threatened by it ; it does not trample our crops ; it does not destroy our villages ; and it does not damage human health .
It is a relationship with great shared interests and unlimited potential .
We must be financially realistic and prudent and I trust that the House will note my concern at this latest threatened raid on the fisheries budget .
The other new amendments are the result of the sound cooperation between Parliament , the Council and the Commission .
This decision , its good and bad aspects notwithstanding , means there will be wrangling in no uncertain terms about whether the EU should make emission reductions in a way that acknowledges the message of climate research and do so only after international talks on the agreement .
I am afraid that the European Parliament is less than happy about the course the European Council is sailing .
.
May I call on those Members who agree with this view to stand .
. Mr President , honourable Members , I am very grateful to you and to everyone who has contributed to this debate .
But I am not going to go into what was a historic initiative at the time , I would prefer instead to set out some of the essential details of the strategy paper .
Madam President , today we have an appointment with hypocrisy .
It would be preferable to see what the proposals bring and only then to consider whether self @-@ employed drivers should adopt this framework or whether separate regulation is required .
The one @-@ stop @-@ shop schemes , which are at the heart of the package , will ultimately enable new rules for cross @-@ border businesses and business @-@ to @-@ consumer services to be introduced .
Winners , why do I say that , because as part of the Treaty of Amsterdam we have been able to give public health and the consumer greater priority .
In a fortnight the Prime Minister will be at the December European Council meeting , discussing with President Sarkozy the proposal to create a comité des sages .
That instrument will be complemented by another instrument on the mutual recognition of criminal @-@ law protection measures .
This is where legislation has a serious role to play .
I hope greater cooperation will be achieved between the WTO and other international organisations and bodies , such as the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) , the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) , the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) .
The possibility , if necessary , of having additional inspections of animals in these areas is not a question of artificial protectionism or the restriction of freedom of movement , as there really is justification for it .
Acceptance has been higher where the social partners have been tangibly involved in the development of employment programmes .
The impact assessment that you have presented is very good .
This is especially important in the present economic conditions .
We can count through each row here and see how many of us that will be .
This option will require a considerable degree of ambition on both sides and a willingness to tackle , inter alia , non @-@ tariff measures and the removal of obstacles that hamper European Union companies &apos; access to Japan &apos;s market for public procurement .
The Finnish Presidency of the Council warmly welcomes the fact that today only some of the amendments are to be voted on .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . - ( DE ) Madam President , allow me , in the space of sixty seconds , to make a few brief remarks on behalf of my honourable colleague Bernard Rapkay .
The European Union has all the data and instruments for getting involved in the long @-@ term reconstruction of Haiti .
If Hans @-@ Peter Martin clicks on a home page now and wants to order a book from America or a certain piece of software , what barriers and what bureaucracy will he have to contend with ?
The few measures that have been taken are constantly criticised and the directive on family reunification is the subject of an action by our Parliament before the Court of Justice .
Our powerlessness is combined with anger .
Let us listen to their voices , let us exercise humility , let us not confuse secularism and security . Change is already happening in these countries .
We regret the fact that the European Parliament has been reduced to an advisory body on this issue and that we are not able to make a more decisive contribution .
. I welcome the adoption of two reports calling for closer co @-@ operation between Member States on the twin evils of sexual exploitation of children and the trafficking of human beings .
The English version is incorrect and simply reads &quot; in order to be able to represent him in legal proceedings &quot; .
In this instance , the newly appointed Mr Praet comes with an unblemished record and was approved with distinction at the hearing carried out by Parliament &apos;s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
Rather than unsubstantiated denunciations of the US secret services , the EU ’ s political authorities should be focusing on how to prevent terrorism effectively and how to meet their responsibilities as regards world security , in close cooperation with the allies and in compliance with the fundamental principles of international law .
Our commitment and the way in which we handle the situation in Bosnia over the next few months and years will be decisive , not only for the future and security of Bosnia but also for the future and security of the region as a whole .
For that reason we are going to vote on this proposal for a resolution as it has been drawn up and not with the amendments that have been suggested .
However , it is not just about form ; it is also about substance .
It could therefore take action on dynamic aspects of heritage and , from this point of view , a European list may represent real progress .
I do understand the situation depicted by the co @-@ authors of the oral question , but unfortunately , I cannot give them any other answer , so we need to leave it to Latvia itself to take care of this problem , which the Union is not in a legal position to resolve .
It has a special place in the promotion and the development of local initiatives .
The widespread adoption of the MHP seems to be the most obvious means of achieving interoperability .
The lack of jobs , particularly in recent years , is a serious problem and must be tackled with a dash of ambition to ensure that by 2020 we can guarantee 75 % of Europeans decent , secure jobs that meet the needs of the wide range of people who are preparing for the world of work .
( PT ) Mr President , the crisis in Japan has given further meaning to our collective commitment to creating a 202020 Strategy .
In the Stability Pact , we try to avoid getting into debt , but in the German Finanzausgleich , the accumulation of debts is rewarded , and federal states which have no need of getting into real debt are forced to do so nevertheless .
Therefore , we are in complete agreement that local and regional authorities should participate where projects related to the Structural Funds and the environment are involved .
At the same time , we are calling for the deadlines for attaining the targets of the proposed directive to be brought forward to 2017 .
The approval of the PPE @-@ DE proposal , albeit by a narrow margin , undermined the whole basis of the consensus obtained .
After all we should not forget that SMEs are still the biggest job creators .
It was not Spain that opposed a patent in the past , it was other countries , which are now rushing to have one .
To me it was important to reaffirm the necessity of security as a prerequisite for maritime transport and to stress , in spite of the difficult economic context , the need to respect high standards of protection of the marine and coastal environment .
A solution may not present itself for the factual separation of the eastern fringe , the long and thin region of Transnistria situated along the border with Ukraine , until Ukraine joins the European Union .
The European Union cannot be an area concerned solely with the affairs of the countries that it comprises .
I believe that the Galileo satellite system serves two vital purposes .
In this regard , I particularly wish to highlight fine particulate matter limits ( PM2.5 ) , which are very high and which exceed those set by the World Health Organisation .
It is a general problem .
To the report .
In order to counterbalance economic aspects with social considerations , there will have to be an increase in the mechanisms which the Treaty and agreements have already succeeded simultaneously in introducing in the field of employment .
Countries which behave in this way are wasting our time , money and potential .
I believe that alongside the investigation that has been demanded any number of times , there must be a comprehensive analysis of the sources of any further potential destabilisation in Uzbekistan .
The debate on the Green Paper is still open .
Of course we will also have to look at what it is possible to do regarding air transport .
The same applies to chemicals and pesticides .
I do not wish to take on board the extra amendments now on the table , therefore , because they put under pressure the compromise adopted with an overwhelming majority by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
I am particularly happy to have the opportunity to discuss the two reports being presented to us today , because they are two reports - that of Mr Mitchell and that of Mr Seppänen - that are interesting and that raise entirely relevant issues . I hope that we will have the opportunity to return to these issues later .
The Commission has proposed making it easier for members of recognised producer organisations to sell a limited part of their produce direct to the consumer .
We need this stimulus because last year the number of the unemployed in Europe grew by 1.7 million .
No miracle power .
It is these things that we demand of Basel , and if the Basel Committee does what we want it to do , we will be able to adopt the rules without making major changes to them .
Structure and rates of excise duty applied on manufactured tobacco
I also want to assure you that I will do all I can to ensure that the coming stages of this important procedure will lead to a positive change , to significant progress where renewable energy sources are concerned .

The country was destabilised as a result of economic problems brought about largely by the structural adjustment programmes of the World Bank .
( The President cut off the speaker )
The EMU convergence criteria do no more than set out a sensible path for budgetary policy which every state should aspire to in any event .
In any crisis , there is also an opportunity , and it is of precisely these opportunities that we must make greater use .
I am aware of the multiple problems facing that poor country - one of the world &apos;s poorest - but nevertheless , I think we can expect from the government of Bangladesh the same respect for human rights that we expect from the rest of the countries in the world .
Hence , it is essential and legitimate that we ask to be associated with the European Commission and Council during these negotiations .
However , the Commission is willing to state in the recitals of the directives that tenderers must comply with applicable social rules , including collective agreements of general application in performing public procurement contracts .
As regards diabetes , the work of the Commission has therefore concentrated on encouraging cooperation between Member States through public health programmes .
In comparison , 6 000 people die of AIDS every day .

The first is providing information and raising awareness amongst the public , the buyers and sellers .
. The EU can only develop and establish itself if it is based on values such as solidarity , non @-@ violence , law and order and the resolute promotion of public non @-@ violence .
Since those who were due to speak are not present , the debate is closed .
It is also your task to get this message across .
To this end , Madam President , advance planning is needed and I can say , Madam Vice @-@ President , that our political Group will support the Commission in this work .
My departments are already studying in detail the suggestions and recommendations proposed in this report .
In this section , there is no room for solutions such as that proposed by the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , which , by taking an extremely orthodox position in opposition to public aid , would have disastrous consequences for the European shipbuilding sector .
We have witnessed in the past the reform of labour markets and social insurance systems in several Member States , and these have included pension system reforms .
By the end of 1956 , more than 153 000 Hungarians had fled to Austria , and another 30 000 followed them later .
For example , as I see it , we cannot accept an inflation rate of over 3.3 % simply because it makes it easier to achieve secondary objectives such as economic growth and employment policy .
( PT ) Mr President , as the Franco @-@ German directorate is no longer seated in this Chamber , I will direct my three questions on the recent frenzy of penalties to the Commission and Council .
We must however look at which countries are attempting to sell from the little that they produce because they need other vitally important goods .
Firstly , I think that the report has become too detailed .
But I had committed myself , having changed the order of Mr Zacharakis &apos;s question , to that question being replied to today at the end of questions to Mr Lamy .
The Stockholm Conference has provided chilling and terrible data .
Yes , it is difficult , and we are quite happy that it should be done next week , but I ask you to admit that it is your fault , for it is you who have stood in the way of this issue being debated the whole time .
In time , parents making such a choice would ensure that this became the industry standard .
However , the basis of the Commission &apos;s perspective is the need for protection and our responsibility to provide it .
This means new opportunities for the European transport of goods .
It is vital to ensure full respect for private life and the protection of personal data .
I believe that women who work also have household chores to do , and they perhaps have to do two times or three times the work .
Mr Dimitrakopoulos has already mentioned that there are amendments .
Now we find that Britain &apos; s solidarity extends across the Atlantic and across the Pacific Ocean .
Mr President , my Irish PPE @-@ DE colleagues now fully support the liberalisation of the postal services within the Union , and we voted accordingly .

If anyone had prophesied two years ago that it would prove possible to replace the entire cooperation procedure with the co @-@ decision procedure he would have been regarded as a nutcase !
The World Anti @-@ Doping Agency , WADA , coordinates and promotes the fight against drugs worldwide .
By allowing public services in the Palestinian territories to collapse or by trying to keep them going against the odds and by trying to promote reform ?
Talking of the Member States , Parliament has had to put up with hijacking manoeuvres and a lack of cooperation on the part of those who were then in charge of the Spanish Government .
Mr President , I must firstly thank Mrs Ayala Sender for her report because our work was in fact very constructive . She took into account most of the amendments tabled by the various members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism to ensure that we arrived at a draft directive that could be adopted , if not unanimously , at least by a very large majority in the Committee on Transport .
Everyone needs to move into action now .
We are now starting to develop action plans and other measures to implement the biodiversity strategy .
The problem is that the UN has come to no such decision .
The increasingly tangible decline of the UN &apos;s traditional role as a world organisation able to guarantee order and peace calls for the creation , still under the aegis of the United Nations , of new , more flexible international bodies , designed to deal with monstrous crimes like genocide , xenophobia , torture and violations of human rights .
That is like the police ordering all guard dogs to be put down after the number of burglaries in a residential area has doubled .
We all agreed on this when we dealt with the forerunner to Mr Stockmann &apos;s report .
Motion for a resolution ( B5 @-@ 0338 / 2000 ) by Mr Goebbels , on behalf of the PSE Group , on the meeting of the European Council ( Lisbon , 23 and 24 March 2000 )
I do not want enlargement to be a political undertaking reserved for Sunday @-@ best speeches , while on Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday we pursue a policy which is opposed to enlargement .
The Dublin Convention and Eurodac should also be viewed in the same light .
Europol is toothless if it has insufficient personnel at its disposal , and at present a mere 12 Europol staff are pursuing inquiries into terrorism in Europe .
Beware of gradually and insidiously accepting the unacceptable !
This morning , now the United Nations Secretary General has been given the backing of the Security Council for his mission to Baghdad , we all wish him every success .
Not only would it be physically impossible to attempt it in today ’ s world of the Internet and of circumstances changing by the minute , but this would also mean giving up the competition , and would result in falling irrecoverably behind .
Russia &apos;s Khamovinicheskii Court was supposed to pass sentence on one of them today , but for reasons that are unclear it postponed the announcement until the end of the month .
Criticism against the Union and &apos; the rule of Brussels &apos; will increase and there is a risk that this will feed extremist nationalist parties and organisations and thereby add to the tension and unrest in the Union .
Former Soviet states also need cooperation with the EU , a sentiment supported too by Joe Biden during his recent visit to Chişinău .
Finally , a further example of successful work was the Monday conference on the gas infrastructure which took place thanks to the European Commission in Brussels and which resulted in a declaration on the modernisation of gas infrastructure in Ukraine in order to prevent the future reoccurrence of a crisis such as the one in January this year .
Following the debate we had here yesterday , and in view of the Commission &apos;s contribution , I very much agree that we need more discussion and that we need to find a proper legal basis for actions that are not pure ODA actions - but are still very important for development cooperation with developing countries - and therefore do not fall under the other instruments regarding cooperation with industrialised countries , nor under the current DCI .
Yesterday , the Commission took up a clear position ; Mr Casini and Mr Prodi have commented on it , and Mr Busquin has just now cast doubt on it .
The objective , following your vote , is to be in a position to achieve the adoption of the package at second reading at the end of this year .
( PL ) Madam President , today we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the democratic changes in Central and Eastern Europe .
It welcomes an Australian proposal to list the great white shark in Appendix II of CITES with a zero quota on precautionary principle grounds .
Then , another proposal for a temporary committee of inquiry was tabled by our fellow Member , Mr Barón Crespo .
As I have already stated , the Social Fund , as well as other Structural Funds , allows for long @-@ term activities aimed at adapting regions , sectors and work processes to economic and social change , in contrast to the short @-@ term demands of specific exceptional situations .
Russia ’ s decision to shut off gas supplies to Ukraine and Georgia has shown just how effective this tool can be .
Europe &apos;s cultural practitioners , technical innovators and , above all , Europe &apos;s citizens deserve a well @-@ functioning internal market , where creative content can flow freely and generously across our borders and where cultural practitioners are secure in the knowledge that they will receive remuneration for their work .
I support this report because it highlights the importance of initiatives such as the Black Sea Synergy and the Eastern Partnership .
I am grateful to my fellow MEPs for the constructive input and would warmly recommend the report for which Mr Maat did most of the groundwork some time ago .
Joint tourist trails and the development of transport , the environment and contacts between universities will be high @-@ visibility projects and will create an image for the Danube strategy .
However , the SIS alert is a means of transmission of the European Arrest Warrant .
The concept of innovation is multidimensional : it includes not only scientific research and experimental and technological development , but also the development of new processes , methodologies and organisational and behavioural models .
A strong boost is thus needed to sales of this economically important sector by means of marketing and promotional activities .
To those who argue that the opt @-@ out reduces bureaucracy , I would say that records of hours worked should be kept anyway .
That leaves the excuse of what some call the need for confidentiality , trust or even secrecy .
The difference is that the Dutch economy is growing and the Netherlands has gradually made its system a little more sustainable , but that is the only difference .
The Amsterdam Treaty is giving more powers to Europol in the area of judicial and police cooperation and this Treaty is set to be ratified shortly .
She has always been most open at all times to discussion and debate , always understanding , always courteous to Parliament &apos;s members of the Committee on Regional Policy .
But in reply to Mrs Boogerd @-@ Quaak who asked why we do not move ahead of the Court , the answer is that we expect the Court judgments on the two cases pending before the summer .
This initiative and its classification are , in my view , the wrong way for the European Parliament to handle such a fundamental constitutional issue as the entire EU decision mechanism , including the proposal to abolish the pillar structure in the area of justice in favour of the Community method with full co @-@ determination for the European Parliament .
I look forward with quite a lot of expectation following the commitments of the job summit .
The world economy requires skills , flexibility , availability and knowledge of languages .
Mr President , we have now debated three motions for resolutions , firstly on Algeria , then on Serbia and now on the International Criminal Court .
The current level of aid , for example , will set the minimum for the future , while future economic performance should determine further developments .
I also agree that we should not overlook borrowing , but this means that we need to use the primary structural deficit ; in other words , we need to subtract amortisation costs .
I would like to thank everybody who took part in the debate , in particular the President @-@ in @-@ Office .
As luck would have it , most of those millions went to the four main left @-@ wing newspapers .
This happens in Italy , Greece , Germany , Spain and many other states , but not in all of them .
We are therefore dealing with a failure to respect the normal rules of democracy and have therefore to ask ourselves a question : what kind of process of democratization is under way in Albania at this point in time ?
A few candidates are , in our opinion , clearly not up to the task and , in one instance , do not even meet the Treaty requirements .
The report by Mrs Lulling already has a long history .
This is a sound and positive document .
The social partners are asked not to bother themselves with economic policy , but only with social policy .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
The Court of Justice , through numerous judgments , has created an internal market for many services .
I belong to the generation that , in Italy , is called the &apos; ebb &apos; &#91; apolitical &#93; generation - I am too young for either &apos; 68 or &apos; 77 - and I am used to thinking of the police and the carabinieri as those who ensure personal safety and who have made it possible to defeat terrorism in Italy .
Yes , we certainly will be , but I add , as so often , a determined yes , but above all a watchful yes .
As has already been pointed out , Tunisia has more female students than male at its universities , and the standard of living has increased .
It requires open dialogue , not confrontation ; it requires us to address the real and perceived disconnection that some young people are experiencing .
In reply to another question , I hope the relevant decisions will be taken in September - and I am sure by October .
There remains a huge gap in the development of alternative , non @-@ animal testing methods .
Responding to the struggle of the journalists of Belarus for the truth , in our statement we strongly condemn attacks by the Lukashenko regime on the media , journalists and any person who freely expresses their opinion — that is our responsibility .
We want here to maintain specific measures for women and young people without jobs , for handicapped people and for the long term unemployed .
While I have a high opinion of the rapporteur &apos;s main position , which is based on the European Parliament &apos;s traditional stance , and while really important issues have been debated , together with issues which , in my view , are not important at all , such as the location of the Community &apos;s agency , we have in reality forgotten about communicating with the public and we have lost track of the time that has been spent .
Do you intend to collect data on these issues more directly and quickly , given that the problem appears to be getting worse , especially at this time , in numerous Member States ?
I hope that we will reach agreement here quickly , so that we do not regret it when another disaster occurs and we cannot act quickly enough .
In fact , I am convinced that its success will depend on this to ensure that the European Union &apos;s external action is more than the sum of its institutional parts .
There are also difficulties in obtaining credit .
Advertising and misleading information on products with a high fat , sugar or salt content should be banned ;
Parliament was aware , when it voted in favour of the new financial regulation , that it would have consequences .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Madam President , I believe it is madness for this European Parliament to approve the 2009 EU budget when financial irregularities or possible fraud affect between 2 % and more than 5 % of the total .
They may be faithful but their husbands are not , and they do not use a condom either .
The present proposal for a regulation is simply intended to transpose various recommendations adopted by the GFCM , and already in effect in the GFCM &apos;s contracting States , into a single Community legislative act into which future recommendations can be incorporated by way of amendments to that act .
I did so not because the report , overall , is not good , but because one element in it was so important , in my view , that I just could not bring myself to vote &apos; yes &apos; .
Today I have discovered that this has sometimes taken five months .
You will see , therefore , that there is a considerable difference between the normal procedures and the efforts being made to implement the programme for Northern Ireland .
The problem we are dealing with here is essentially a political one .
However , this plan does not revolutionise the system completely for the simple reason that we first need to give our incipient reforms a chance .
This is why our amendments that call on the Commission to consider the opportunities for creating jobs from a better care sector in the EU 2020 strategy are so important .
It is in our interests to be generous , active and efficient .
... and their accompanying delegation will take part in the European Conference entitled &apos; Initiative for Democracy &apos; tomorrow and on Friday .
So , one third of all the tax goes to compliance .
Subject : Practice of the European Court of Justice with regard to openness Recent events in the European Union have shown that EU decision making must be public .
Mr President , Commissioner , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , I would first like to express my warmest thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Seppänen , and the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , for an excellent report and some excellent cooperation .
rapporteur . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should first like to forgive you for mispronouncing my name , and , secondly , on Amendment 4 , I should like to propose that what might be called the factual part of the amendment , that is , only the first part , should be maintained .
This should be the European Union &apos; s policy .
Your reply failed to take that into consideration .
The combination of high temperatures , poor ventilation , overcrowding and lack of water can be lethal .
There is an opportunity to develop efficient forms of energy which allow us to continue to be competitive , and which are clean and non @-@ polluting ; and also to guarantee supply because these are new forms of energy .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the enlargement of the European Union will change the political landscape .
I doubt that the US Congress would devote a day to discussions , as we are , after Johannesburg .
It could blow the deadline completely out of the window .
&lt; empty &gt;
The initial reaction of anyone who , like me , has been mainly occupied with the issue of employment over the last few years must be to be happy with the results , because I have never seen so many pages devoted to employment in a final report .
Certainly , this tribunal will not be able to continue its work indefinitely .
If I understand correctly , such a fund already exists , and is mentioned in the Declaration on the Joint Institutions annexed to the Cotonou Agreement and is , in fact , specified to be in the region of EUR 4 000 000 .
The Council is not here and it would be interesting to know what the Member States and the Council think about this situation , when they do not sign the national declarations and given that , with the present difficulties in public finances , the citizens will be demanding .
Gender @-@ sensitive performance indicators should be assessed in mid @-@ term and final reviews .
This is of the utmost importance for the international legitimacy of this decision , and it is for this reason that we have rejected Mr Posselt &apos;s amendments .
Of course , when we come to take the next step , it is important first to focus on better legislation in order to promote growth and employment , simplification , efficiency and a reduction of the costs involved in implementing programmes before we ask for more money .
Too many women are victims of violence , which is often physical , of course , but which can also be verbal and psychological . Moreover , it often occurs within the family environment , and these women are ashamed to admit it .
The European Union has adopted guidelines in human rights on issues ranging from the death penalty to the prevention of torture and support for human rights defenders .
The crucial debate on milk will take place in connection with the Health Check .
That is still the only proposal that the Commission has submitted to Parliament .
There are three amendments which propose that the text of the regulation should stipulate that the harmonisation of charges for access to national networks must be limited to the charges applicable to producers and that those charges must be reduced .
Dates for next sittings : see Minutes
continuing the procedure to review the cohesion of our development policy , which is needed to support developing countries in their efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals .
We need to concentrate on the essential issues , as it will be easier to reach a joint decision on the matter and then we can reach a reconciliation .
This step is a necessary one , even though , in my view , it is just the first one .
The rapporteur has also requested that the function of the programme with regard to the coordination of structural actions on matters of international cooperation in the energy sector be clearly set out .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Madam President , Minister of State , Commissioner , before I turn to Malta , Cyprus and the procedure , I should like with your permission to make a few preliminary remarks about the euro .
Can the Commissioner tell us , for the British public too , what exactly , more or less , the contributions for England are going to cost us all ?
The conclusion of such an agreement , along with the upcoming free trade negotiations with Japan and India , will undoubtedly be one of the most significant steps in implementing the EU &apos;s strategy of becoming the most important trade player in the world .
Commissioners Hahn and Andor , are you concerned about this general climate of cuts ?
I sometimes think that Commissioner Fischler is also arguing along these lines , but he is doing so extremely cautiously .
The first is the demand for development aid .
It is , however , clear that even though the structure of the family has evolved over time , it has always been the natural context for caring for children , for the development of individuals , for solidarity between generations and for educating young people , and an assurance for the future and for the stability of society .
That is what is important .
Parliament is calling for only the bare minimum of what would be desirable , taking the budget constraints of the Member States into account .
If we fail to keep our promises or respond to those expectations , the results will be much more far @-@ reaching and serious than those that we are seeking to achieve in the attempt to construct the European project .
Finally , and in keeping with the humanist and realistic image of our European integration process , I welcome the substantial increase in the appropriations dedicated to the policy in favour of the most impoverished people in Europe .
I would say to him that there is concern in Ireland over the allocation of the second mobile phone licence .
However , when it comes to the practical , as we have seen in the Balkans , the results are a disaster , an absolute disaster .
Mr President , the general benefits to be had from the internal market are beyond dispute .
There is an urgent need for genuine consultation with employees , an urgent need to dispense with the attitude of treating men and women as goods which are no longer useful , because shareholders consider that they are not profitable enough , even in spite of the true economic situation .
Top @-@ class sport is the shop window of a society , but at the same time it reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the countries concerned .
That is what we want most for our shipbuilders - that they can operate with the minimum of state support because they are operating in a fair competitive environment .
However , in this case , the EU is making special arrangements for governments , outside of normal State aid rules , for greater flexibility to manage subsidies to coal mines .
Mr President , the protection of biodiversity is a fascinating subject .
He will lose the floor immediately if it is not a procedural motion .
However , it is surely an idea worthy of consideration .
Fortunately , as far as the protection of the citizens is concerned , reactions at national level and in a number of Member States were rather more rapid and effective , compared with the incredible slowness and the usual paradoxes of Community bureaucracy .
After September 11 , though , nothing is standard any longer .
Because Islam and democracy cannot coexist .
More than many other debates , which are often comprehensible only to the initiated , dealing with pillars and harmonizations , today &apos;s debate is an acid test of our willingness to voice the concerns of the European public .
I also believe it is a shame that , in view of such a situation , the European Commission has not proposed measures to stimulate these projects and has simply accepted this state of affairs .
The Commission is closely monitoring the situation by means of our delegation in Vientiane and we are going to continue to analyse the human rights situation and its possible impact on the EC @-@ Laos cooperation programme in view of the joint EC @-@ Laos committee scheduled for next autumn .
Citizens must also be protected , however , from unnecessary and unwanted State interference in the private sphere .
Not all regulations - as Mr Blokland also said - relating to pesticides are equivalent in all countries , and the Commissioner is perfectly aware that they will be unified , but not before the minimum time limit of between 5 and 10 years .
The problems facing producers are not over .
That is the way we should choose , and that is how we can use the Treaty in the absolute best way to respond to the global challenge .
As regards civilian @-@ military relations , the outcome of the last year &apos;s constitutional crisis confirmed that the democratic process is of key importance .
Our current migration policy is no longer acceptable .
We feel that it would , if necessary , still be possible to look into improving and fine @-@ tuning the approach and objectives to be followed in order to avoid breaking the ties with our American allies , although they are the primary polluters of the planet , but we must certainly not give in to the temptation to perform further studies .
Unfortunately , our work and the text of the resolution have come under criticism in the Latvian media .
The debate is closed .
This development is aggravated by the steadily increasing monopolization of production and , above all , distribution ; as a result , inferior cultural products imported from America and elsewhere dominate the market .
The initial exchanges within the Committee on &apos; policy challenges and budgetary resources for after 2013 &apos; , of which I am a member , indeed raised doubts about the long @-@ term funding of the regional cohesion policy , some of the programmes of which relate to the IMP .
Distortions of competition must , in so far as is possible , be avoided , and , if European policy is to be credible , the maximum possible reductions in CO2 must be achieved .
Mr President , the Ancient Roman jurisconsultants used to say that ex facto oritur jus ( the law is formed from events ) .
Obviously it is necessary to determine the relevant criteria for airport charges and what these charges actually represent .
I believe it can be taken for granted that sooner or later , with Ireland or without it , the substance of the Treaty will be implemented .
Mr President , we must remember that the governments of the United States and of some Member States of the Union , against the beliefs and wishes of the majority of European citizens , are reaching the point where they are calling into question the model of European political integration that brings with it the awareness of another form of globalisation , which is more human and egalitarian and which demonstrates greater solidarity .
Consequently , before proposing policies on refusal of entry we should discuss how to broaden legal entry channels and how to tackle the demographic challenge .
The next item calls for statements by the Council and the Commission on the economic and employment situation in the air transport sector and in the industrial and related services sectors .
I would particularly like to congratulate Mr Hughes on his report .
In Denmark , for example , mortgage institutions issue bonds to the entire value of the mortgage credit .
Together with the US , the EU must find a way in which mutual trust can be strengthened .
The question then arises as to what Europe can do about this .
May I wish you , on behalf of the European Parliament , all the best in your demanding work for a peaceful , flourishing and democratic Bosnia and Herzegovina where new generations will grow in the spirit of mutual understanding , tolerance and cooperations .
We should bear that in mind .
As for the budget , I fully understand what the rapporteur said .
Investment is needed to develop regional grids and small @-@ scale power generation , however , and this includes investment in research .
Europe belongs to the European public and part of its mission is to contribute to promoting employment , and to improving living and working conditions .
I commend Mr Elliott &apos;s resolution to the House .
The way in which we deal with minority groups and refuse to accept integration is a disgrace .
It is also important for the European Union &apos;s policy to be consistent .
Mr President , I should like , very briefly , to indicate the position the Socialist Group will take on Mr Macartney &apos;s amendments .
I have to inform the House , however , that some Member States have expressed strong reservations about this suggestion .
Farmers expect immediate answers , and today we are here to accept responsibility to speed things up , to tackle the crisis in a decisive manner , and to put the lessons of recent experiences to good use , thus avoiding wasting time and quickly remedying a situation that is in danger of becoming even worse .
In the past the international community has not done so .
Retaining the law in its present form would be contrary to the national interest of the Slovak Republic and the majority ethnic group because the law will provoke suspicions and poison the atmosphere of good relations between the ethnic groups that have lived together on the territory of Slovakia for more than a thousand years .
As we now know , the beating of a butterfly &apos;s wings in Strasbourg may sometimes unleash a hurricane thousands of miles away .
I would first and foremost like to remind everyone that we in the European Parliament are badly placed to get on our high horse regards Croatia . The great majority of this Parliament , after all , never even uttered one word of help to the Croatian population when , with difficulty and enormous risks , it pulled itself free from the Yugoslav straitjacket .
Auschwitz was the largest of these camps , and it was conceived in order to eliminate the flower of the Polish nation .
To them I say , anyone who destroys the environment will finish up with nothing left to trade in !
Mr President , I guess I come from one of those ultra @-@ peripheral regions , in this case called Finland .
They are not diluted by this proposal .
High @-@ level diplomacy is obviously needed , but it must be carried out in consultation with the people .
The Council dropped its earlier estimate of EUR 500 million to 360 million .
We have listened to and taken into account the fears of certain Member States and of the Council as such .
Of course we are opposed to marital violence , who would not be ?
It is simple : we cannot say that we need a small reform when this Union was designed for six and now , thanks to its success , has fifteen Members and we are willing to allow 25 or 30 .
From this standpoint , the objectives in terms of inflation , as they were evaluated at the start of the period , ought perhaps to be reviewed .
The Green Paper was to be an incentive to extensive debate and was intended to result in measures for substantial improvement of the current system of patent protection .
It is very important to ensure that a child is not a means to an end , but one who , through adoption , finds a loving home and who will be treated as a unique , precious individual .
Let us not forget that the objective and founding principle of European regional policy is to reduce developmental differences between individual areas in the European Union , and the phenomenon of territorial exclusion has still not been properly taken into account in political instruments .
So either the English version is the correct one or else the other versions are .
I think that is an excellent initiative and I also look forward to seeing next year &apos;s report .
I would like to refer to the &apos; memorandum of understanding &apos; between the European Union and China on trade for the textile and clothing sector , which expires this year .
Initially , this was because the British authorities had to decide which towns and cities should be chosen for the initiative , and what funding those towns and cities should receive .
4 .
Get the sides talking , keep them talking .
In addition , the Commission ’ s right to take the initiative and the role of the national parliaments must be strengthened , whilst providing for the involvement of this House .
Yes , that is correct .
What we do not want is a concept of European citizenship that is seen as the artificial creation of a supranational identity that seeks to replace feelings of nationality .
While I am on my feet , I would like to add an oral amendment presented to me by Mr Ebner , which I fully support .
To say the least , we take three months to register people &apos;s petitions or complaints ; this delay is unacceptable .
We remind Russia of our joint commitment to cooperate in fighting cybercrime both in the context of the Common Space on Freedom , Security and Justice and by acceding to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime .
The code &apos;s influence goes beyond the EU : all the accession countries , the EEA , EFTA States , Canada and Turkey now subscribe to the code &apos;s principles .
Citizens themselves have a right to political convictions , to belong to a political party , to stand as candidates in elections .
This is the whole purpose of the European project , otherwise there is no European project .
I agree that that the EU @-@ Canada economic relationship has not yet reached its full potential .
What is known as the eco @-@ social market economy is the European regulatory model .
And some of our Member States , including my own , Belgium , are sending weapons to this country .
Consequently there is no Community law or Community rules relating to strikes .
I am also certain that some of the proposed amendments will be largely taken into consideration in the new proposal for a regulation that the Commission has included in its own programme of work , on which Parliament has recently delivered its opinion .
Mrs Frassoni , all issues of acceptability are studied with the chairmen and with the services before the vote .
I would add that the Council &apos;s common position introduces an explicit opt @-@ out review clause .
I think what we can say , clearly and unequivocally , is that Parliament expects the Commission to undertake a study to review which of the diverse models that already exist in Europe would genuinely be best for the European Union .
We supported his middle way , his willingness to enter into dialogue and his unwavering commitment to non @-@ violence .
In the intervening period , which is set to last for some time , they need support for democracy , education , the environment and the economy .
What is important is that the EU directs funding for research across Member States to ensure we have a full and accurate picture of the scope of the problem .
We must not fail those who look to us to succeed .
The Council has expressed its deep concern regarding the lack of progress in the Middle East peace process , and is asking for it to be resumed on the basis of the United Nations Security Council resolutions , the conclusions of the Madrid Conference and the road map .
Someone said we ought to thank the United Kingdom because it has forced us to understand the absolute need to go beyond unanimity .
The economic growth of these countries is of key importance to their political and social stabilisation .
This is a highly political issue and has to do with the facility for centralised planning within an economy in which the people own the means of production in sectors of strategic importance .
If we managed to build such a mechanism , we would also not need to worry about the future of the new market .
Let me be clear : the most stupid thing we can do is to forget what we set out to achieve . Why the concept of European integration came into being .
In this context , I would say that , when the euro is in place , any sudden rise in energy prices would represent a risk not only for energy policy but also for monetary policy .
Guarantee against losses for EIB loans
We did of course hope that a newly @-@ elected Palestinian government would be guided by the principles I have enumerated , and the Council observed very closely to what degree there was any perceptible movement in this direction .
I must point out that unfortunately we cannot simply draw on best practices in the Member States .
It is important to underline that gender mainstreaming requires not only high @-@ level policy statements but also the political will of the leadership of the EU and Member States .
No one can expect a Member of Parliament to work here for ECU 2 827 .
We have done a constructive job , and I believe that we avoided resorting to dictates or mutual recrimination .
For the US to disregard a UN decision against early military action would deal a potentially fatal blow to the United Nations .
I will give the floor to the Commissioner if she wants to respond to these two specific points , but I thought the Commissioner &apos;s response was very clear and comprehensive .
The 1978 Cooperation Agreement served its purpose very well but the European Union and Egypt have changed beyond recognition and a new agreement was necessary to underpin what has become an altogether more mature relationship .
The Commission welcomes the intention of the Finnish Presidency to have an in @-@ depth debate as the logical next step .
There may be unanimity regarding the aim ; there are , however , clear political differences when it comes to the choice of remedies and how they are prioritised .
It is quite unacceptable that an accession candidate should still be occupying parts of an EU Member State , namely Northern Cyprus , to say nothing of planning a military attack on another country , as is currently the case against Iraq .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I too wish to thank Mr Dirk Sterckx for his excellent preparation of this report .
We need to re @-@ establish confidence in the peace process ; and I hope that Parliament will help to bring that about by adopting this resolution by a large majority .
And that sets out more guidelines and the way forward that we want to see happening .
The Iron Curtain is definitely gone and I thank you for that .
We are aware of the fact that scaling up sexual and reproductive health and health funding in general requires a far more coherent and multi @-@ sectoral approach , also involving other MDGs .
The annual economic report fails to highlight this weakness .
Therefore , the Chair believes that it is not inadmissible and , as it is not inadmissible , we will begin debating it and , at the appropriate point , we will vote on it .
This proposal has taken four years : how long will it take if we embark upon a complete reform ?
I also want to highlight the importance of the harmonisation agenda , which was the focus of the Paris Forum on Aid Effectiveness held in March this year and emphasises the importance of strengthening beneficiary country systems of financial management and control , which is precisely one of the things that we are doing .
Consumers are often worried because they do not have accurate information .
Discussions were positive , but there is no doubt that events in Gaza and the West Bank have greatly complicated this effort .
Rather than stigmatise these people , we need to put an end to these human tragedies .
( NL ) Two weeks after the disaster , some of the Burmese people have finally received rice , beans and medicines , but that aid is still not reaching a quarter of all victims and is arriving criminally late through the fault of the junta .
Mr Morris , this problem has already been discussed by the Bureau , on the basis of an official request submitted by a number of Members , and there has already been an official reply from the Bureau .
Subject : Prospects for establishing more criteria for economic and monetary cooperation
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
At European level , we have a Budget made up of commitments , which means that there are always commitments outstanding .
I do not understand how you could pass comment on us , Commissioner , when we should have been commenting on your speech on the matter .
This House ’ s position is clear .
For there to be mutual recognition , each Member State should know about the registration requirements in other countries .
In addition to improving rail and sea transport competitiveness , we also need to take other action . One possibility is an environmental charge specially designed for air traffic .
This means that the funds necessary to at least institute countervailing measures are lacking , and the general public is left to bear the consequences again .
in writing . - I and my Labour colleagues strongly support the commitment made by the G20 to work on a financial transaction tax .
Now I turn to the proposal about the questions about the financing from the Seventh Framework Programme .
I should simply like to mention , briefly , six points which to some extent constitute the backbone of any reform which we might , together , envisage and desire .
Fourth , the UN and the Commission will coordinate their efforts with other international organisations on the HIPC and other initiatives .
Aquaculture and agriculture are totally different sectors that must be addressed separately .
I fear that some of the institutions in East Timor have not met our expectations in this regard .
While its final status remains in doubt - full member of the EU or of a future Mediterranean Union - what seems certain is that the EU is trying to find solutions which best serve the interests of the major economic and financial groups in the main countries , in particular Germany .
Beyond its legislative work , the Czech Presidency has also been able to confront challenges of a political nature , some of which were extremely sensitive , indeed extremely serious .
In addition , if the EU 2020 objectives do not go beyond simple intentions , this strategy will not achieve anything .
Some might say that support does not go far enough , but it is the beginning of a greater role for Community policies to combat unemployment .
In the same way as the agreements are often beneficial to industrialised countries and harmful to developing countries , women and men are , in different ways , placed at , respectively , a disadvantage or advantage by trade agreements .
We proposed estimates for funds to promote tourism in Europe .
As soon as the Commission receives that new reorganisation plan - we hope that this will be during this month of November - we will examine the content of the new commitments and we hope that they will give sufficient guarantees to allow the granting of the funds which are still pending .
According to this report cigarette fraud in the European Union amounted to over £ 1.28 billion in 1997 alone .
I thus suggest that this be placed on the agenda for the Transatlantic Economic Council .
Does the Council not share the fear expressed recently by the Bank for International Settlements that there is a risk of deflation if we push the price stability objective beyond what is appropriate ?
Fundamental Rights Agency - activities under Title VI TEU ( vote )
European Community law governing the enforcement of intellectual property rights applies to trade names only insofar as these are protected as exclusive property rights in the national law concerned .
We must strengthen the monitoring and control system of zoonotic agents of animal origin in order to reduce their prevalence , whilst stressing that the effectiveness of the texts that are currently in force has been restricted by the fact that some Member States are failing to apply these texts properly .
What I would propose would be to be active in this area , on the one hand in the area of tax relief and , on the other , in the area of assistance .
The proposed ban on advertising and sponsorship will be discussed here in detail next year .
Yet we must continue to discuss the links between these dimensions and the conditions required for sustainable growth in Europe .
On the contrary , it has been shown that the increased exposure of local markets in peripheral regions to competition from the central regions can bring about economic decline in the peripheral regions .
The Bureau &apos;s services will set to work immediately as you are indeed right and we must find out where this list is and bring it here .
I really do think it is important for us to make this distinction , simply because it is necessary .
As my predecessor as leader of the ELDR Group , you demonstrated our commitment to enlargement by involving MPs from the candidate countries in our work .

We cannot use a report , regardless of its substance , as a pretext for engaging in deliberations on structural or institutional problems .
A system which arbitrarily reduces contributions on the first 32 hours of work and then increases them for later hours does not seem to me to be in accordance with that new principle of transparency which we are trying to secure .
There are indications that the text is not completely in line with what had been agreed with the United Nations .
On the basis of a European undertaking , Gorizia and Novagorizia could become a laboratory of ideas and initiatives between different cultures and ethnic groups , so that instead of being an encumbrance , the frontier becomes an opportunity for collaboration and growth .
We have also worked to create a clear link between implementation of the directives and Community cofunding which has proven to be very effective as well as ensuring a close relationship with the LIFE financial instrument , because when they see that the money is threatened if they do not comply with the regulations this will definitely put pressure on the Member States .
As I have said many times before , and cannot repeat enough , cooperation is the bedrock upon which to pursue a constructive and focused dialogue on the central issues of drugs policy .
In that respect too it is an extraordinarily useful report .
Why is it that some employers ’ representatives want these discriminatory restrictions imposed on the citizens of other Member States ?
I should like to discuss one of the points the Commissioner raised , and I would ask him to elaborate on this .
The old directive has indeed fallen behind changing circumstances , and does not ensure sufficient protection .
The European Parliament joins with Mr Valéry Giscard d &apos;Estaing in hoping that the forthcoming IGC accepts the Convention &apos;s draft more or less in its present form . Parliament would hope that all the possible proposals would have been debated openly and that its conclusions would reflect the political will of the citizens .
Only a consensus between all three bodies will enable us to achieve common principles and the common principles of action .
I take your point on the different systems working . Nevertheless , this is such a serious issue .

The fact that we want blood donors to be volunteers should not be expressed in absolute terms .
The Commission undertakes that in five years &apos; time it will report back to you on these changes .
With regard to the three &quot; left @-@ over &quot; questions , do we think today that we are in a position to answer the question to which the Amsterdam Summit could not find a solution ?
I also think that the proposed timeframe , namely to grant discharge or postponement in April and to pronounce a final verdict in October , is the correct one .
This should be the message going out to the industry from the Commission White Paper .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Verheugen for his reply , with which I am satisfied .
Chapter 6 of the Maastricht Treaty contains the provision that Parliament should be consulted , admittedly only on the most important aspects of European internal policy .
However , we were particularly angered by the imposition of the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant in 1993 .
in writing . I support Mr Chichester &apos;s report .
I have often said in this Chamber that fish unfortunately do not swim separately and very often , when one species of fish is caught , others also swim into the nets .
In fact , Commissioner , over the last few weeks I have had a number of problems of double taxation affecting employees referred to me , and these employees came to me so that I might intervene to help them get out of absurd and often difficult situations .
How can anyone imagine for a moment that insurance companies , whose sole ambition is to make money , would do better than systems based on national solidarity at financing the cost of medicine - an ever @-@ increasing cost because of technical advances and increasing life expectancy .
I think that the recommendations in this field do not respect the importance of cultural diversity in Europe .
The second principle in the Council &apos; s common position is the retroactive element in the draft directive .
This role must be fully acknowledged under the common policy .
The European Union also lent its support for the Tenet cease @-@ fire plan that came into force on 13 June 2001 with the agreement of both parties .
So far the EU has harnessed substantial resources under the European neighbourhood policy with little in the way of results , and this has not done much for the EU &apos;s image .
The Services Directive , adopted in December 2006 , puts the principle of free movement into practice , with the aim of creating a common market for services within the European Union .
As far as I know , no committee of this House as yet has brought that to the floor .
What can the Commission do to protect Rima &apos;s fundamental rights ?
Finally , the fourth area .
We must also consider the redefinition of the boundaries of corporate and social democratisation .
This document contains detailed proposals for a series of measures and , in particular , speeds up the application of the legislation approved by Parliament and the Council following the Erika disaster , the so @-@ called Erika I and II packages .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , the starting point for our discussion are the negotiations with Switzerland .
As an observer of the presidential elections in Ukraine , I should like to share an observation with this House .
The vote will take place immediately .
I guarantee that the commitment of candidate countries has already been taken into consideration in the latest generation of Daphne and STOP programmes , and they are already being involved in concrete action .
Report ( A5 @-@ 0313 / 2001 ) by Mr González Álvarez , on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee , on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council Directive on general product safety ( C5 @-@ 0298 / 2001 - 2000 / 0073 ( COD ) )
Can I draw the honourable Member &apos;s attention to the title of the question he set down earlier . The title of the question was &quot; Radioactive pollution of the Aegean and Ionian Seas &quot; .
I am of course glad to hear it said that we are dealing here with an historic dimension , which must not be allowed to be brought down by this or that detail .
Everyone , including all of the committees , is talking about financial transparency .
For fear of losing credibility on the international stage , the Union must , in my opinion , have the courage to make strong political decisions , and I join Mrs Flautre in calling for the suspension of all cooperation with Tunisia .
I will not repeat the comments made by the Presidency on foreign policy issues other than to note the importance we attach to cooperation at the United Nations on Iran , to promote the six @-@ party talks on North Korea and to work with Russia in the Middle East through the Quartet .
Fortunately , my American counterpart has disabused us of this pessimistic notion .
To both these questions we expect precise answers .
- ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , the climate and energy package which we are debating today represents a compromise .
That is also why the European Year of Languages falls under the umbrella of education .
We must similarly ensure that people are aware of their rights , and that they are able to derive full benefit from them .
There is therefore a good case for more harmonisation of the relevant legislation in Member States .
Market regulations are therefore important .
European consumers will benefit directly from this .
We all know whose fault it is and this has been investigated in great detail .
The Irish people in their great wisdom have rejected that Treaty by democratic vote , and although people in Brussels and people here in Strasbourg will work and cajole and bribe and intrigue to try and persuade the Irish to change their minds , the decision of the people should prevail , and in this case Ireland has stood for the people of Europe .
Today , the country of Algeria - this large and important country - faces two major challenges . Firstly , there is a youth revolt in progress , for Algeria is a young country , and its young people are rebelling because they feel that no one cares about them and they have no future .
The majority of Member States will find it impossible to achieve the collection targets proposed in Amendments 26 and 27 of the report .
However , we must ask why a normal principle and a normal right , which are enshrined in the treaty , are not being recognised .
We could have made it clear through our resolution that we intend to oppose the devaluing of human rights , for established human rights must not be called into question .
I should like , first of all , to record the excellent and constructive atmosphere that prevailed during the meetings preceding the first reading of the 2008 budget by the Council .
This includes an emergency social assistance programme under PHARE amounting to ECU 20 million , a contribution of 1.1 million from ECHO for emergency medical and food aid , as well as ECU 12.5 under PHARE for energy imports .
That concludes Question Time .
She needs to deliver on that , but there also has to be a structure for that desk officer to report back to the centre , to make sure we get some joined @-@ up government in terms of the way the European Union deals with human rights .
Now that we are considering the fundamental problem , it should be pointed out that countries which have relied on international investment have achieved far more progress than countries which have shut themselves off behind all kinds of socialist regulations .
However , I do stress that the European Union has an obligation to do whatever it can to save the peace process and that it is essential that it should honour that obligation .
Something had gone wrong with the purchase : money had been wrongly deducted from money he had handed over .
But this was far from the case .
I want the timeframe in which complaints are dealt with to be improved as we go forward .
If , however , the policy were only implemented in Europe , it would be a totally unnecessary waste of EUR 500 billion .
It is of course welcome that by July we will have started regular discussions with new Member States , but should these discussions not perhaps have been started a year ago , so that we could have kept to the proposed schedule ?
If we want to achieve sustainable improvements for children we must focus on the main causes for infringement of their rights , but above all we must collaborate with all of the voluntary organisations that over the years have become well rooted in these areas that are so different from Europe in terms of their culture , economy , structure and politics .
There is a real risk that key financial businesses will relocate outside the EU to the benefit of no one other than our competitors .
That is the position of our group , subject to the arguments we are listening to now .
I therefore support this report .
Commissioner , it is now almost a year since it was agreed during the European Council in Lisbon that the European Union wants to become the most competitive knowledge @-@ based economy in the world and this Parliament rallied around that goal with a large majority .
The second priority is globalisation , which accelerates trade , diversifies needs and redefines the geographical position of territories and peoples .
The interoperability debate mainly concerns broadening the choice offered to consumers in the area of interactive television services .
In that respect , I am concerned at the fact that 60 @-@ tonne lorries have been allowed to creep into all the reports .

Approval of the Minutes
I should also like to point out that life expectancy in good health is longer , and currently stands at an average of 62 in Europe , although this age varies greatly between different Member States .
. ( PT ) Our commitment to combating transmissible diseases , with particular focus on poverty @-@ related diseases , such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria , and on improving vaccination and healthcare levels by the more developed countries funding health programmes , by removing barriers of access ( licences and patents ) to pharmaceutical products faced by developing countries and the barriers faced by international partnerships in developing new generations of products is crucial .
We see today how poverty has been combated in large parts of Asia .
In this context , then , Commissioner , I call upon you to pay greater attention to your own Commission &apos;s commitment to reduce the administrative burden for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
The fight against terrorism is thus seen as a top priority , whereas the fight against the greenhouse effect , AIDS or poverty is mere formality .
It is therefore impossible to remain silent in view of the arrests of those opposed to the current regime , the most authoritative members of the civilian society of that country , nor can we tolerate lightheartedly the fact that several international oil companies are still working in the Ogoni region , despite the violations of human rights and environmental pollution .
Naturally we are confident that gradually and realistically , but also with the necessary urgency , we can continue to refer to &apos; solidarity &apos; while turning it into concrete actions and measures .
( PL ) Commissioner Barrot , I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss matters with you , even if you are no longer Transport Commissioner .
The Commission feels that its own proposal offers a balanced solution which can effectively guarantee freedom to provide services as well as safeguarding Community seafarers &apos; jobs on passenger services between the Member States of southern Europe , which is a highly labour @-@ intensive sector .
This is at best a start .
Decisive moments have been the meeting of the Council of Ministers in San Sebastián , under the Spanish Presidency , the announcements of national programmes for electric mobility and the motor shows , not only in Europe , but also in Detroit and Beijing .
I think this compromise accords with the spirit of yesterday evening &apos;s debate and I would ask my colleagues to accept this as an oral amendment .
It is important that we remember that the people in the European Union are entitled to have proper representation in relation to their concerns .
Europe can and must develop its own strengths to deal with the fast @-@ changing global energy economy .
As a social democrat who emphasizes the fundamental of social rights of the people and the long @-@ term well being of the society , I support this proposal for its depth and comprehensiveness in addressing these issues .
Yes , Mr President , yes Commissioner , the European Union has an essential role to play in this region .
There was a unanimous agreement between the European governments and the Commission , along with the proposal made by Eurocontrol , to act in that way .

In respect of mercury the general maximum level is 0.5 mg / kg for fishery products .
Mr Aznar , you are particularly keen on the teachings of the governments of Russia , Israel and Turkey .
Against this background , solutions relating only to budgetary problems are inadequate , as these problems are closely linked to economic problems .
The barbaric assassination of Professor Marco Biagi in Bologna yesterday tragically confirms the need for this commitment .
This means that biomass must be not only produced sustainably but also burned sustainably .
Another conference of this kind is being held today and I believe it is urgently necessary to involve the European Parliament in the preparatory work of that conference and in setting its objectives .
We who are in Europe &apos;s Parliament , though , must continue to insist on these publications being followed by the publication of brief Minutes and of the voting record .
We have missed an opportunity to ban those substances , which will continue to accumulate in the little bodies of Europe &apos;s children and cause numerous health problems .
4 .
The democracy that needs to be established in Bosnia also depends on democratic conditions prevailing in Belgrade .
Even Cyprus might still happen , to the benefit of all of its citizens and the European Union .
Toughness is the only language these Mullahs understand .
I would have liked the Commission to have had a firmer and more visionary approach , especially since we have all the instruments on the table today and this was the best option identified by the impact assessment .
In my opinion , the Council has taken no account whatsoever of the political aspect of our relations .
The link between the regional dimension and FP7 is important in the sense that they should be mutually reinforcing .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the action programme set out by the Cairo Conference combined effective demographic policies with human dignity and emphasized the central role of women in the development of peoples , in demographic stability and in promoting peace .
The latest United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) report makes for troubling reading .
Access should only be given to data concerning vehicles with a cylinder capacity above 55 cc , and data concerning trailers and caravans with an unladen weight exceeding 750 kg .
Moreover , parliamentary history will do the rest .
It appears as if the Valencian authorities have designed this Stalinist law in order to achieve their plans cheaply .
Indeed , aid must not be misused for further tolerating conditions or for keeping regimes in power that have been violating human rights for years .
I want to point this out so that we can stop the circulation of inaccurate facts .
Firstly , I should like to congratulate my friend Mr Takkula on his report .
Although I cannot therefore accept these amendments , I have no problems with the underlying message , which it is worth conveying , and that is that the current range of products needs to be reviewed , and I will ensure that this issue continues to be dealt with and discussed in the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products .
Member States have a key responsibility to promote these centres and , where appropriate , the structural and cohesion funds of the Community should be used in support .
We need to ensure protection for the most vulnerable .
However , let us not forget that governance and better regulation are the shared responsibilities of all the European institutions and the Member States .
It has decreased significantly as a result of the global economic crisis , but half of the remaining deficit , and in fact , the entire trade deficit recorded for the first half of 2009 is equivalent to our current trade deficit with China .
Our group sends its best wishes to the American Secretary of State for his efforts to bring peace to the Middle East .
It is highly regrettable that the European Commission makes lamentable statements instead of expressing at least their moral support for the MEPs who are going to observe elections in Minsk , and instead of stating that in the event of any provocation by the Lukashenko regime against parliamentarians they are ready to take action in their defence .
Mr Posselt , we had to complete the first round of speakers from all the political groups .
The people of the European Union blame us all for lack of action on employment .
I do not mind flexibility - that is good in politics - but this seems rather more chaotic than one &apos;s definition of flexibility .
Do you share my view that further changes are needed in order to support the poor parts of the world ?
Nanoparticles have a high surface area and significant surface energy , which give them the following characteristics :
I think that at this time the European Parliament &apos;s work should be to make sure that you and the governments actually achieve those results .
At the same time , the EU and other organisations are promoting neo @-@ liberal economic reconstruction in Kosovo , but this is not what the local people want .
I want to suggest how she could do much better than this .
If you study the dossier on taxation you will find extremely precise points with regard to this .
We are talking about 2 200 tonnes of waste , containing carcinogenic chromium , contaminating the waters of the Mediterranean and we know full well that contamination has cross @-@ border repercussions .
Madam President , the annual report of the European Monetary Institute , the last report by this institution before its transformation into the European Central Bank on 1 July , shows , as the rapporteur of our Assembly so nicely puts it , a certain bias towards generalization .
Each individual Member State should , as far as possible , endeavour , through international and regional cooperation , to promote the conservation and protection of threatened species .
In its seventh year it continues to be a crucial policy instrument .
The origins of the recent disturbances are deeply rooted in the fundamental divisions which exist within Northern Ireland and must be addressed by achieving a new beginning for relationships within Northern Ireland , within the island of Ireland , between the peoples of Britain and Ireland , and by agreeing new institutions and structures to take account of the totality of relationships .
&lt; empty &gt;
I regret this attitude of hostility towards doctors that is shown by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and I wished to protest against this by abstaining from the vote .
In short , our governments must do more , and they must do it more quickly .
The European Union has set itself clear rules on how to proceed when not even minimum standards are respected .
Parliament will then have the possibility to discuss them with us thoroughly .
It seems to me that the fifth framework programme is designed along these lines , but I think that a further appraisal , based on the criteria proposed in this communication , would be useful for studying and evaluating other measures in terms of taxation , job motivation and mobility , with a view to improving the link between technology and industrial competitiveness .
President Barroso and High Representative Solana will report back to Heads of Government on the progress made and on the next steps .
This leads on to the second point , namely electrical energy .
I believe we must have a level playing field but we must harmonise at a realistic level .
And in terms of documentation , there are families that have been entirely abandoned ; they have no documents and they therefore do not have certain rights as citizens .
– Mr President , the report on the place of supply of services has to do with the taxation of services for persons who are not liable to tax , and resulting as it does from the Commission ’ s report – submitted as long as three years ago – on the amendment of the rules relating to the taxation of services rendered to taxpayers , it relates to the business @-@ to @-@ business sector .
The difficulties encountered by the Committee on the Environment in these three reports are indeed not limited to the three directives chosen but extend to all EC environmental directives .
I recognise that this proposal will require significant efforts by both operators and authorities , but I shall stress that these efforts are both worthwhile and necessary .
Similarly , it is self @-@ evident that we should respect human rights and observe the international conventions that are in place for refugees .
As such , this Treaty is an important step in the right direction .
We must do everything we can .
During the next few weeks and months , I will closely follow the preparatory process towards this date so as to ensure that the all @-@ important EU trade concessions towards South Africa will indeed effectively kick in on this agreed date .
Unfortunately , European industry does not take that view .
We need it - and we shall prove it by the way we vote - to protect consumers .
It remains an option and we decided not to eliminate that option for those countries and economies that were used to it .
So I treat this as a beginning and not an end .
So any measures to support small and medium @-@ sized enterprises are of long @-@ term benefit to this major branch of the economy , which unfortunately still has no legal basis in the EU treaty .
To confine ourselves to the latest development within the Council , the Finnish Presidency has prepared a questionnaire addressed to all the Member States and to all the European institutions on the subject of &quot; Women in the Decision @-@ making Process &quot; .
in writing . - ( LT ) I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution , because the energy strategy should specifically address how access to energy can help lift people out of poverty , while facilitating the shift to an environmentally sustainable energy development path .
That , moreover , is precisely the job of the European Ombudsman .
Issues that directly affect the family include the changes in the composition of the workforce , the new forms of labour organisation , the restructuring of social protection , and the changes in the distribution between men and women of tasks involving the care of dependents .
This is one area where we can actually achieve something , and I think it would be a good way to promote greater transparency and more competition on the market .
It will be a fitting end to a year in which the continent has taken centre stage in the European Union and internationally , and in which we have seen extraordinary popular calls for change throughout Europe to make poverty history .
I feel that the work begun by the Commission to simplify and clarify Community legislation is essential .
The Union has succeeded in putting the highest ideals into practice : peace , on which we have founded our Union ; democracy , which we defend through all our policies ; greater opportunities for economic prosperity and solidarity towards the least @-@ favoured regions and groups .
I also feel that , overall , it does not contain anything excessive or disproportionate .
We have had 2.5 million cattle slaughtered in Britain ; we have had to submit about 2 000 pages of documentation on how the disease has been combated , although not yet eradicated , in our country .
The truth is that , one year on , the European Union Member States that have begun to transpose the Johannesburg commitments into their national policies are few and far between .
The way in which we can solve the problem is by re @-@ examining Frontex &apos;s mandate , and then Frontex might need more money .
By writing in the report that the top 200 companies have almost twice the economic clout of the poorest four @-@ fifths of humanity , you do in fact recognise the responsibility of these huge corporations and their shareholders , whose enormous profits come from low salaries and from pillaging the natural wealth of poor countries .
It is quite unacceptable for Denktash to call for a cessation of the membership talks between the Union and Cyprus .
Mr President , let me answer this question as follows . The Council is concerned about the case referred to by the honourable Member .
I think that she has carried out excellent work and , step by step , has led this process towards an increasingly positive outcome .
We must begin with Shell in Nigeria , where the soil is contaminated , with the Community importers of rainforest products who are polluting drinking water , with energy production and vehicle production .
We therefore voted against the amendment which made the development of this policy conditional on the results of the LIFE programme .
I say this not to play down the importance of the efforts that the Commissioners and President @-@ in @-@ Office are making in this direction , but to underscore a political and an institutional fact , that of a European Union that does not have a political entity in a position to act .
For this reason it is exceptionally important to have clear agreement on changes to the relevant budgetary and legislative instruments by the end of this year in order to ensure a transparent framework for 2010 .
The resolutions passed by Parliament last year , these commendable reports and the Commission ’ s proposals all aim to achieve the same purpose .
This might not look like a problem , but I am told that it is the most serious way of exporting Asian bird flu to Europe .
In road transport , what one party gains by infringing the law can force another party to do the same in order to remain competitive .
We clearly expect a political stance to be taken with a very firm deadline of the preparations for the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund . We therefore demand , if this motion is adopted tomorrow , that the Commission and Council appear before Parliament to tell us what positions they will take on this occasion .
Companies should be prevented from changing permanent jobs to atypical work , which leads to a lack of job security .
I believe this is very important and that the measure concerning persons with reduced mobility will be added to those that came into force on 17 February 2005 , that is last Thursday , on denied boarding , cancellation and major delays to a flight . All this has shown Europe ’ s citizens that the Union , its Parliament , its Council and its Commission are also there to make everyone ’ s daily life easier and to make things safer for everyone .
I am also pleased that , together with the European Investment Bank , we have succeeded in providing an additional instrument for risk sharing , and that these sums can therefore be spread significantly further .
Given the current appalling situation in Algeria where hundreds of innocent men , women and children are being massacred by militant Islamic extremists , and given the apparent lack of will on the part of the Algerian Government to take action to protect their own citizens , what steps does the Council envisage in order to impose on the Algerian Government the need to take radical steps to end these gruesome murders of innocent citizens ?
I should like to thank the rapporteur for adopting a genuinely broad and comprehensive definition of human rights , and I hope that this report on the human rights situation in the EU in 1994 will now finally be given the necessary majority in the House in September 1996 .
I think the problem is that there is a huge gap in information and knowledge , and it is up to the Commission to come forward with something to deal with that issue .
The timing of this particular proposal , on the heels of the December Fisheries Council and its decisions on CFP reform and interim cod recovery measures , provides an opportunity for the Commission and the Council to regain some of the credibility which currently is severely lacking - certainly around northern fishing nations such as Scotland and Ireland .
A huge amount of work went into that position .
Thus far , it has performed this job admirably .
Yes , of course there is such a thing as intensive farming , but there is also extensive farming , and I have never come across a refinery producing conventional fuels on an extensive basis .
To that end , vocational training and retraining are of the greatest importance , especially during a period of economic crisis and growing unemployment such as the one we are witnessing today .
First of all , we know that US corporations engage in bribery too .
On the contrary , they are also investments in economic potential , for there can surely be no doubt that Europe &apos;s economic potential depends on a highly motivated and highly efficient labour force , and the reason why we possess this asset is that we have high wage levels and a high level of social security .
Indeed , I believe that the primary objective that we must bear in mind in any attempt to reform the CAP is the support of the European model of agricultural development and the promotion of the economic and social cohesion of the European countryside .
That is why , after an extensive debate , we are tightening the requirements on the whole supply chain starting with the producers in the EU or China to importers and distributors in the EU .
After this initial period , the cross @-@ border cooperation programme underwent considerable change .
Cross @-@ border payments in the Community - The business of electronic money institutions ( debate )
Those who , with a beer in the evening , enjoy the charms of some beautiful , poor , weak girl from the former eastern bloc ?
Whether they choose to play the Queen of Hearts or the Ace of Spades in President Barroso &apos;s House of Cards is up to them , but I remain convinced that Romania and Bulgaria will be an asset to the Union , and not a burden as some would have us believe .
Because domestic work takes place largely within the family home , there can be issues of privacy involved .
Second , to the Council : I noted very clearly and welcomed very much that the Dutch presidency said it would draw its conclusions and will produce a report .
Was it reasonable to omit employment from the criteria ?
I am therefore working on the assumption that Parliament will be firm in stating its intentions when setting down the new Financial Perspective for the post @-@ 2006 period , on which , in contrast to the common agricultural policy , it has full power of codecision .
There is a danger that this practice is turning into a well @-@ organised form of maritime terrorism and a lucrative business , with consultancy and law firms even becoming involved as intermediaries .
It is more generally recognised that the prolonged water shortage and the decline in the land &apos;s productivity have helped fuel conflict .
Since its independence in 1958 , Guinea has only ever known dictatorial regimes .
On the second proposal relating to international carriage , the Commission can accept Amendment No 1 , the second part of Amendment No 5 , Amendments Nos 6 and 11 so far as they refer to the exclusion of urban and suburban transport , Amendment No 7 in principle , the new definitions introduced in Amendments Nos 12 and 13 , and Amendment Nos 17 , 18 and 28 .
In relation to environmental protection , it is extremely important that the EU is given some sort of control .
The directive codifies the case law of the Court of Justice and ensures that it will be consistently applied .
Given the continuous rise in freight transport , the catastrophic lorry fire in the Gotthard Tunnel and similar occurrences will certainly not be the last horror stories about lorry accidents .
Solidarity .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this report has progressed very well .
That was apparent when you arrived late and did not even apologise , unlike Mr Prodi , who arrived late but did apologise .
Mr President , I would say only this to the lady from the Left of this House : the European Union is completely neutral as regards privatisation , but what is a matter of historical record is that employees &apos; rights were never more trampled on than in the states in which everything was nationalised .
What we are now witnessing is the infliction of violence on this peaceful nation , a violence that is escalating and causing the mass exodus of Tibetans to Europe and to other countries round the world .
This is quite remarkable when you think that it is all money originating from the same tax payer .
We cannot enforce a speaking time on them .
I would like to call for data to be transferred between Member States in a manner which guarantees its confidentiality and security .
The right of veto must remain for defence cooperation , together with the principle that EU military cooperation should not be developed alongside the North Atlantic Pact but within the fold of NATO cooperation .
Again in November 2007 the matter of the social integration of the Roma was incorporated into the text of the Parliament &apos;s Resolution on freedom of movement , upon my recommendation , as a European @-@ level Roma strategy .
We need to open that debate .
To be more specific , we need to award extra marks to programmes approved for funding which include the gender dimension .
However , it has been by far the most successful form of transport in adapting to modern market requirements .
In this respect , interoperability may be achieved by methods other than the harmonisation of equipment , since it is possible to adapt equipment to operate in different configurations , following the example of the quadruple @-@ system locomotives .
– Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have mixed feelings to some degree when we look at the history of NEPAD .
With a view to the future , the Commission will continue to monitor how the situation develops , including the work under way , with a view to the signature of a treaty intended to clarify the status of Chechnya within the Russian Federation , as well as the preparations for the presidential and parliamentary elections in the Russian republic , scheduled for October and December .
From 2003 onwards , all new vehicles would be fitted with anti @-@ blocking brakes .
The farmers themselves are in a very , very critical situation , where they are extremely short of food and the excess taxes on them makes the situation even more catastrophic .
It is ridiculous .
Some politicians have panicked and called for the criteria to be relaxed , but all this does is to undermine the credibility of the euro and place a time @-@ bomb under any new exchange @-@ rate mechanism .
Russia is indeed at an important crossroads .
The associated legal and financial obligations , such as , observing standards on wages and working conditions , and , the payment of taxes and social security contributions are also thereby externalised to subcontractors and employment agencies .
Hence the decision to make governance in general a horizontal and central theme in the programming of the tenth EDF , because combating corruption can only be successful when embedded in a broader agenda of capacity building .
As we are now extending the front where the fight against climate change is taking place , we can no longer afford to make the same mistakes again .
Of course , Mrs Marinucci , the social partners need to introduce some rules here , preferably at European level , but rigid legislation is the kiss of death .
The Commission agrees that they can go hand @-@ in @-@ hand , though this does not mean that they have to be integrated .
The European Union must also pay more attention to the continent ’ s forest wealth in terms of preventing fires .
The European Union is certainly very concerned about the deterioration of the situation in Belarus , especially with regard to human rights .
The report also recognises that , like any other modern industry , farming needs to be competitive , efficient and able to respond and adapt to market demands .
I believe we need to remember that respect for different positions should be the starting point for deliberations .
First of all , everyone should condemn extremist nationalists and distance themselves from them in their own country .
In these days of transparency in the conduct of our business , it seems to me that is a provision which ought to be re @-@ examined .
Consequently , I think I explained clearly how our thinking is developing . I also defined the limits ECOFIN and the ministers themselves have already set .
We are now in a third period : in this third period , the composition of the bodies which wield political and economic power needs to be changed .
Road transport is responsible for 72 % of all emissions generated by transport , but the time has now come for us to reaffirm the importance of the car manufacturing industry from an economic and social perspective .
To those who would say we do not always get the best people in that way , I would say rubbish ; 51 % of the population are women .
Your report makes important recommendations , and we agree with you that it is vital to do more to monitor the compliance of legislative proposals resulting from the Charter , to improve the reception conditions of migrants and asylum seekers , to ensure that the fight against terrorism is conducted fully in compliance with fundamental rights , to redouble our efforts to combat discrimination , to improve the situation of the Roma throughout the European Union and , I would also add , to cooperate more closely with the Council of Europe .
I shall finish by saying that , to my mind , it is worthwhile looking into the benefits of escaping from the office environment and going out onto the street , and , as Members of the European Parliament , we should be the first to do this .
I think we have to draw distinctions .
I shall therefore vote against these two reports and would call on the Commission to put forward new proposals that are more realistic .
This is reflected in the legislation of 38 states , with only 13 African states considering it legal .
Can we resolve that we will examine the situation of carers and that we will include them in our recommendations on work in future , and that we will no longer discriminate against this important workforce which is already discriminated in the area of pay .
It is a great shame .
However , in connection with the rapid development of IT , it needs to be brought up to date and , of course , we cannot drag our feet on this .
But , compared with the current situation , we will have achieved a great deal if the directive as contained in the common position or , even better , with the amendments adopted tomorrow , can be improved and can enter into force quickly .
I agree with the rapporteur when he talks about the need for prudence regarding initiatives to regulate the financial markets .
The Commission will report annually to the Council and the European Parliament on the measures adopted .
Even the best conceived and most balanced employment policy , thorough social protection and a system of pensions , sexual equality and social benefits will not be perfect unless it is grounded in the basic values of society – on ethical and moral norms .
Statistical data showing clear discrimination have been ignored .
Both countries have had minorities from the beginning and both have developed a great tradition of tolerance .
With its new package of proposals on electronic communications , the EU is promoting measures to police and intimidate users of the Internet and all electronic communications , by introducing &apos; filtering &apos; systems on the pretext of public safety and protection of rights .
We have known what is happening in Kosovo since 1989 .
We expect deeds , not fine words and summit photos .
( FR ) Mr President , the debt problem is of a magnitude that far exceeds the purely budgetary dimension .
The key reason for setting up the temporary committee was the fear of industrial espionage .
It shares the view that a bottom @-@ up approach would complement efforts to set up a central administration .
Everybody appears to be waking up today to the corruption of Mr Ben Ali &apos;s regime .
Our Group tabled an amendment taking up the Council &apos;s proposal , an amendment which was judged to be inadmissible when in fact , quite obviously , it was a qualification of the annex mentioned in Article 1 of the proposal for a resolution .
In my opinion , this needs to be discussed .
It is the key to success in the areas that I am proposing here .
Côte d &apos;Ivoire is the most prosperous economy in West Africa .
I say &apos; timely &apos; because , if one looks back and sees that between ECU 40 billions and 50 billions have been spent in aid since 1975 , yet many applicant countries are worse off today than they were at the start of Lomé , something must be wrong with the system .
I would , at long last , like to have a response to my question on cash management and the solution to this problem which is particularly hitting small and medium @-@ sized businesses .
I should therefore also like to ask that the recommendations again recorded in this resolution , be followed up both by the Commission and by the Council , so that it can be monitored whether the will for peace is really increasing .
Canada is , for instance , opposed to the EU &apos;s GMO policies .
Mr President , I merely wish to enquire whether we shall have the opportunity to explain our vote on the important decision we have just taken .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m.
The work the EU is doing , the support we enjoy from public opinion in Europe , growing awareness worldwide , the backing of the European Parliament and the prospect of an agreement by the end of the year on the package of measures we have proposed in order to strengthen the EU &apos;s negotiating power - all this will enable us to reach an agreement in Copenhagen in order to tackle climate change effectively .
In March I argued that it would have been better to opt for a freeze on bilateral agreements until the conclusion of the negotiations between the Commission and the United States .
Recent developments in the United States are alarming indeed , but we cannot allow experimentation with , or a market in , human life .
Based on a certain timeframe , the mandate of EASA can then be expanded to include other aspects of flight safety , such as the human aspect , the quality of pilot training , etc .
We must quickly put an end to this new tight @-@ fistedness and new hesitancy in the European Union .
It will particularly benefit the EU &apos;s net contributors .
Frankly , ladies and gentlemen , I do not understand how we can both want a European arms agency , intended in particular to promote and coordinate harmonisation of military equipment , and not at the same time commit the Member States to buying this equipment .
I would like to say that 30 or 40 years ago , it was completely unrealistic to think that I should ever stand before such a comprehensive body and be answering your questions .
In my country , VRT , the public broadcasting corporation , which is funded by all Flemish taxpayers , has , in totalitarian fashion , decreed that it will not invite the largest party in Flanders , the , to appear , which amounts , in effect , to censoring it .
That I cannot answer today , but I can assure you that it will be looked into .
In this respect , it should be noted that universal service is a concept borrowed from the telecommunications service , which in my opinion cannot be automatically transposed to the audiovisual sector .
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
How will it create European public spaces in the capitals of the Member States ?
The situation in Romania , which I am most familiar with , provides a clear example of this : approximately 3 million hectares of land remain unused , while the power lost across this area is roughly 187 terawatts per hour .
Brazil is seeking to reinforce its influence with the global governance system and needs our support for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council .
Consequently , we have the obligation and responsibility to improve the operation of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and to make it the world ’ s political conscience , and I am pleased with what has been said here in this regard .
Apart from EU membership , the best guarantee for Estonia &apos;s future is peaceful cooperation with Russia . One day , Russia will perhaps overcome its enormous economic difficulties and appreciate that good neighbourly relations benefit all sides .
The accession negotiations that have already begun must be continued , and done on the basis of their own merits .
What you have to do is propose an end to all the production aid .
The debate is closed .
I thank Mr Michel for his determination and for the resolute fight he put up in Durban , but it is intolerable that the Syrian regime should do what it did in Durban .
The late Pope John Paul II , who addressed the European Parliament in 1988 , used the following metaphor to describe this : he said that after overcoming its division , Europe is breathing with both its lungs again .
Mr President , I thank Mr Hegyi for his report and for accepting a number of amendments that I put forward .
The best cure is prevention .
Where do we go from here ?
That is not acceptable .
So I agree that there is a need for common rules on transport , the environment and working time in the EU .
On several occasions the European Union has expressed its concern in the face of events in Burma and recently , on 30th May , the anniversary of the 1990 elections , the European Union adopted a statement inviting the State Law and Order Restoration Council , more commonly known as SLORC , to mark this occasion by freeing those people detained and to commence a true dialogue with groups in favour of democracy .
An analysis could be made of the reasons why the Legal Affairs Committee should be consulted , as the internal advisory body in this case . I am prepared to make this analysis , because I have done so before .
. From the very outset of the debate on a new European law on chemicals , I have argued in favour of the Commission proposals being revised in order to secure better protection for health and the environment in Europe than was formerly the case , while reducing excessive bureaucratic demands .
We shall proceed to the vote on the motions for resolutions within the vote .
in writing . - ( RO ) The report deals with unfair commercial practices in the advertising field , as defined in the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive , and concentrates on issues arising from the development of new advertising practices and technologies .
We have put an end to the Cold War : this must also be possible in the Middle East .
Moreover , I believe that , as time goes on , it will be quite natural to make much more stringent demands upon the content of training .
The actions will contribute to guaranteeing all of the Union &apos;s consumers a high level of protection and to ensuring the effective application of the consumer protection rules .
I also support a united Ukraine , a country that is both our partner and a powerful neighbour .
The Commission could then come forward with a report on all aspects of the situation .
In accordance with this legal basis , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market considered that there was no reason for the establishment of restrictions of an administrative nature , either for entry into a country or for free movement and residence .
Holding back this enlargement would indicate that Europe has still not buried the past , that it has not learned sufficiently from history , and that globalisation is not yet its internal requirement .
in writing . - ( FR ) Following the shipwrecks of the oil tankers Erika and Prestige , the European Socialists led the fight for &apos; high @-@ end &apos; EU legislation on maritime safety .
In September , at the last meeting we held , we tried to implement a three @-@ phase process in order to achieve , by the end of 2005 , the dream of so many of us - and of so many Israeli and Palestinian citizens - of having two States which might live together in peace and have a joint future of harmony and stability .
We often demand , very arrogantly , of small states that they honour commitments that have often been imposed upon them , so we must be rigorous in demanding that when a major power enters into such commitments voluntarily , it is scrupulous in upholding them .
Mr President , the assassination of Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and the seven other Palestinians was a clear breach of international law .
The Bullmann report , which was initially reasonably balanced , was then ruined by moving too close towards the positions put forward by the Commission , another reason why we should oppose it .
It was also due to the determination of the Commission to recognise that all three institutions needed a cultural change .
Although it is a very toxic substance , the benefit still outweighs the risk when your child is less likely to die of persistent organic pollution poisoning than of malaria .
The Commission &apos;s report to the Council was evidently never submitted , and there was no comeback from the Council .
At this moment , it is even more important to try to put an end to this conflict , as a key contribution towards a peaceful and stable region .
What we are actually talking about here , therefore , is the transfer of an already very successful field into Article 4 ( 3 ) .
I want to mention some of them .
For this reason we repeat once more that the issue of the railways , which we regard as urgent and about which we are in sympathy with the Commission study , must be looked at very carefully and very assiduously , since it is very easy for these rail freeways to prolong the dissection of the railways of the European Union .
I very much regret that these proposals were immediately shot down .
It is therefore necessary to fundamentally improve the overall coordination of cohesion policy at EU level .
We have insufficient direct influence on the situation in Serbia itself .
The rapporteur calls on the European Commission to submit concrete proposals for defining and implementing consistently the objective of territorial cohesion , emphasising the importance of the principle of decentralisation down to local authority level ( the &apos; bottom @-@ up &apos; approach ) , with a view to improving the level of absorption of funds ( it is counterproductive that regions administer , on average , only 30.5 % of the overall budget allocated to the cohesion policy , with the remainder being administered by central governments ) .
That really should go without saying .
In the light of the reform applicable in 2014 , the common agricultural policy must respond to the following priorities : viable food production , sustainable management of natural resources , measures for combating climate change and balanced territorial development .
By the time of their accession on 1 January 2007 , they must learn how to do the work that we do here , taking each other ’ s words into account and taking each other seriously .
What I do not see is a proper concept of democracy that involves starting from the bottom .
That is also why I said in my introduction that I was pleased with Parliament &apos;s report on the nitrates directive , and that we have taken specific measures against countries which are failing to comply with the directive .
That is enshrined in the EU Treaty and the Council of Europe has formal agreements on the matter .
It is , moreover , regrettable that the developing countries were not prepared to negotiate on this , for it is precisely they that stand to benefit from a favourable investment climate , reduction in import levies and transparent legislation .
The honourable Member asks in his question for the Commission to supply an assessment of the common position on Cuba .
In addition to ensuring that the programme is effectively implemented , I wish to make a commitment before this House that I will encourage a process of structured and regular cooperation with Member States , in order to work towards drawing up action plans that are up to the task of the challenges , and without which the programme would be less effective .
I would advise each and everyone of us to get away from this strange &apos; post @-@ Nice &apos; concept .
We will see whether this is achieved within a few days .
There are more than enough competent Members of this Parliament sitting in this House to take this vote today and we should go ahead with the vote .
Europe has spoken with one voice to say that it wants capitalism based on entrepreneurship , not speculation , that it wants a reform of the financial system , that it wants a different role for the emerging countries and that it wants ethical capitalism ; Europe has spoken with one voice to defend its principles .
It is time to put the true intentions of the EU project to the electorate in each Member State .
One was about structural change .
The third element is our external responsibilities and , in particular , the policy of association and neighbourhood .
Many of these people have also asked me what we are doing and what Europe is doing for them and their family .
I would particularly like to thank two members of the committee , Mr Chichester and Mrs Locatelli .
The 2009 report already includes new detailed information on levels of fraud and irregularities , and indicates the suspected fraud rate per Member State for the 2000 @-@ 2006 Cohesion programmes .
It is most important that China should allow open public consultation in order to allow those affected by any changes to language policy to freely express their opinions , which would have to be taken into account .
The Tampere summit in the autumn will therefore be a milestone .
For our part , however , we consider that the amendments in question should , as a matter of principle , be in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity .
According to the latest estimates , the project will cost between EUR 10 billion and EUR 20 billion .
What precisely has the Commission done to put a stop to this kind of measure ?
The budget for the latter amounts to EUR 25 million .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
Mr President , there is only one thing we can do with this Goldstone report and that is to throw it in the bin , and right away , too .
Peace is essential for everyone , it is essential both for the Palestinians and for the Israelis .
In the context of European efforts at achieving energy efficiency and the reduction of energy consumption levels , along with combating climate change , it is vital to mobilise the public for this cause . This can only be achieved if consumers are given clear and effective information about energy consumption on products that have been bought or are for sale .
She was head @-@ hunted into the company at a very high level to work as a senior manager and a board member .
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , one of your illustrious predecessors , Jacques Delors , said in a recent interview that the European Parliament would do better to deal with matters of concern to Europe ’ s citizens rather than focusing on human rights in Guatemala or on women ’ s rights in Equatorial Guinea .
The same also applies for Amendments Nos 25 to 30 concerning the national financial frameworks , which should also be placed in the context of the proposals for greater flexibility .
. I welcome this report as it stresses the need for a high quality asylum procedure that acts acquiescent and compatible with the Geneva Conventions in addition to other existing international legal instruments .
It was a great pleasure working with him .
And , in direct response , I shall reply to him that what we are dealing with is a major enlargement , not a minor adjustment .
At the moment , people seem too ready to use the term &quot; piracy &apos; .
We must face up to the new challenges arising in the context of cohesion policy .
They are saying : &apos; Yes , OK , we can agree to regulation ; we just do not want to be stigmatised and we do not want a special system of regulation.&apos;
Neither must we underestimate the impact of climatic and environmental factors that are , by their very nature , hard to predict and force the farming world to face new and difficult challenges due to the global changes that are taking place .
We note that as yet there is no evidence to link depleted uranium and ill health suffered either by troops or civilians .
I know that there are concerns in Greece in relation to the Olympics due to take place in 2004 , and that various discussions are taking place on this matter .
This seems to me to be a more consistent approach for these countries .
in writing . - ( PT ) The goal of the present decision is to establish the organisation and functioning of the European External Action Service ( EEAS ) , a body functionally independent of the Union under the authority of the High Representative , created by Article 27 ( 3 ) of the Treaty on European Union ( TEU ) , as amended by the Treaty of Lisbon .
Personally , I would prefer to work in Strasbourg , but I consider that if we have decided to work on Fridays - and this seems to me to be the issue here - then on Fridays the quorum needs to be present .
As they deal with the same subject , the following questions will be taken together :
( PL ) Madam President , soon it will be a year since our previous debate on the coordination of humanitarian aid and the reconstruction of Haiti .
In combating fraud , we have stepped up operational cooperation with the Member States .
The problem of quota @-@ hopping and flagging out must be addressed for it causes deep resentment in the industry .
Maintaining a significant volume of currency reserves in dollars and yen will undoubtedly be the best safeguard for preventing the speculative turmoil that might hit international financial markets in this stage of transition towards the euro . That will enable stability measures to be taken so that the euro can earn prestige , based on soundness and credibility , as a major international reference currency .
We fully support this programme , but are disappointed that we are being asked to approve something which is lacking in legislative and democratic certainty .
As far as sanctions are concerned , I would like to underline that the frequency of imposition clearly depends less on the wording of the human rights clause than on the political will of the Member States , as well as of the other states .
( EL ) Mr President , I think that we are still missing the point .
That concludes the explanations of vote .
Mr President , many in this House are of the opinion that the Union ’ s credibility in the eyes of the people needs improving .
Nonetheless , it should be noted that some inadequacies that had been identified previously by the Court of Auditors remain and are becoming recurrent , namely carry @-@ overs of appropriations to the following year and cancellation of commitments for operational activities carried over from the previous year .
How will we respond to the expectations of the Ukrainian people and their elected representatives ?
Thank you , Mr President .
It is essential to make this provision ambitious but realistic , and with some flexibility given the EU &apos;s varied climate and economic conditions .
From the Basque Country , a significant majority of the population has watched this agreement with political interest , in the hope that dialogue may soon bring about an end to the sad and violent conflict we are experiencing .
I do not acknowledge that possibility .
We must put a complete stop to business contact , which also means no investment .
First of all , I would like to thank you for your speeches , and I would particularly like to thank the rapporteurs , Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri , for their comments concerning the importance of the Community method , as well as their attentiveness to what might become an intergovernmental drift .
Nevertheless , we must differentiate between the violent actions of small minorities who act like commandos and , with a nihilistic and violent attitude , seek to destroy the things for which we are working .
In fact , a large part of cohesion policy is already serving these objectives and will prove its added value .
We have now promised a reduction of 20 % by 2020 .
Your comments have been noted .
Mr President , it is clear to me that we could easily have turned the 150 pages of the White Paper on the Commission &apos;s transport policy into a 300 @-@ page vision .
Like Mrs Hautala , I was in Oslo last week and I would like to just reflect on one single point .
Mr Cashman , I must tell you that this was not a point of order .
The creation of this information exchange network , which purports to be a pilot project and whose priorities are juvenile delinquency , urban crime and drug @-@ related crime , apart from running the risk of the establishment of European files , cannot but contribute to the criminalisation of young people who are already victims of the security policies adopted in the guise of the fight against the feeling of insecurity .
I believe that we ought to strengthen customs barriers because the EU should protect not only consumers , not only its industry , it should not only support free competition by means of equal market access opportunities , but it should also take action on social and environmental grounds as regards the highly speculative output of Chinese industry .
I believe that we are still not fully represented given the amendment to the Treaty of Lisbon , which is our constitution .
Air strikes perhaps , but what does the EU plan to do afterwards ?
But as Rule 122 stands , according to my interpretation , it does not permit an explanation of vote because there was no final vote .
I am sure that Mrs Zorba would agree that it is still too early to ascertain what direction the proceedings of the Intergovernmental Conference are going to take , even though I would hazard that , quite possibly , consensus will be reached quickly regarding Article 151 , for not everything can be a source of disagreement .
The crisis has been going on since September .
These universal principles of law are no longer valid in Romania when it comes to President Băsescu and the Liberal Democratic Party in power .
France rejected the Constitution by 55 % .
Even the field of human rights has been open for discussion , with an informal seminar in Sweden in December , which is likely to be the start of a series of such seminars .
What is shown on television reflects the spirit of our time , but it is also part of the opinion @-@ forming process .
Better lawmaking 2006 pursuant to Article 9 of the Protocol on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality (
To conclude , I am fairly satisfied with the text of this proposed directive as it takes an important step towards attaining the ultimate goal set out in the fifth Environmental Action Programme of never exceeding critical levels of ozone in ambient air .
A successful Single Market should encourage entrepreneurship and remove obstacles hindering the establishment of new SMEs .
The Community Customs Code is an extremely important project , which will remove persisting hurdles in the European internal market and , particularly with regard to piracy and intellectual property , has global significance .
It seeks , in fact , to modernise and complete the 1992 regulation that set up the single aviation market in Europe .
The precarious situation in which they find themselves is simply the consequence of the neoliberal EU policies which this fund endorses and supports .
Another company , Beaver 84 Ltd , of Basildon was not even told by its intermediary that its application for a financial lease was even on the list for a European subsidy .
What is more , not only do the various Community policies themselves need to be internally coherent , but there also needs to be a coherent approach to policy @-@ making in the various geographical areas in which our development policy applies .
Only by lopping off its diseased branches , by cleaning up its act , can it regain the moral authority it needs to tackle the major challenges which the European Union faces today .
I have just three very simple points to make in support of the position the rapporteur has taken .
I am particularly pleased that the COOPENER Programme , which is itself modest , will serve as leverage for much better @-@ funded programmes such as those foreseen in Johannesburg .
Only those projects that may be financed by private funding are managed differently .
For as long as the Member States of the European Union are not prepared to top up their defence budgets too and make the necessary funds and manpower available , all these doctrines and strategies will seem like empty forms of words .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - Madam President , perhaps first we could send our good wishes to Commissioner Dimas and wish him a speedy recovery .
Another specific example is EU factory ships depleting fishing grounds within the exclusion zones of African states .
Starting with pentaBDE and its harmful effect on our environment and on our health , the picture is very clear indeed .
I was very glad to hear you say that there must be no new conditions , and I would ask you to resist any pressure , from whichever country , for our side to impose them .
We hope the time will come when we can free ourselves from much of the ambiguity and ill will of the many who exploit Europe and do nothing to build it .
At the same time , I would like to pay tribute to our own anti @-@ terrorist efforts .
The euro is a stabilising force , even in times of crisis .
The directive requires the Commission to carry out a public consultation on such a proposal .
Especially important , where agricultural policy is concerned , is the protection of rivers , seas and lakes , as has been mentioned here .
Employment remains the most important problem .
The Eurosystem is therefore currently examining , in coordination with the European Commission and in close cooperation with the market , the feasibility of setting up a Eurosystem infrastructure for the provision of securities settlement services in central bank money .
Basically , the request that we are going to examine to change the agenda is slightly paradoxical , because the entire strategy carried out by the rapporteurs and the Commission was aimed at having a joint debate on those two texts : the policy of the Central Bank and the information and communication strategy regarding the euro .
Clinton cannot forgive the Iraqi government for having thwarted the plot hatched by the CIA to overthrow it and demonstrated that the great majority of the four million Iraqi Kurds would prefer , together with Mr Barzani &apos;s party , to remain within their national borders .
The rapporteur has drafted an excellent report on this matter .
Through nationwide demonstrations , the Egyptian people are expressing their wish to see change .
Mr President , I supported the new paragraph to be added after paragraph 12 , which calls on the Commission and Member States &apos; to acknowledge the EU &apos;s dependence on imports of vegetable proteins from third countries &apos; , with the very important result of establishing , first , &apos; workable import rules based on GM thresholds &apos; and , secondly , of reducing &apos; unnecessary delays in the EU GM approval system &apos; .
Paragraph 49 states that there is no need for candidate countries to meet stricter conditions than the Member States themselves .
In other words , the poor will remain poor and the rich will remain rich .
It is therefore in our own interests to ensure that our neighbours can open up .
Mr President , in a few days we shall have the summit in Thessaloniki , a city - as everyone is talking about history and civilisation - which was the second biggest city in the Roman Empire , the second biggest city in the Byzantine Empire , and which has always been the reference point of the Balkans .
I really hope that you are right in your analysis and that things are moving in the right direction .
We therefore wonder what lies behind this .
VOTES
I would also like to urge the Council and Commission not to use this opportunity to further the project of European integration .
The RoHS Directive is a key element of this policy .
Mr Martínez , of course I shall convey the condolences and sympathy of this House through the appropriate channels .
Parliament will not tolerate delay .
The regulation therefore introduces a system comprising various techniques for identifying animals in order to guarantee traceability , i.e. the possibility of tracing every piece of meat bought by the consumer to the animal from which it derives .
I met an elderly lady whose husband was a taxi driver .
We are going to vote on a package that is balanced , which balances the environment with jobs .
The euro will only exist if the people have faith in their currency .
The outcome could be presented to the public and press during next year ’ s Green Week , and , while I am on this subject , I should like to say that I think there is room for an improvement of over 30 % in the new Parliament building .
The debate is closed .
Now that more than a decade has passed , the balance sheet is clearly positive .
It would , then , be better to think seriously about what is being done in the European market to promote our agricultural products in the face of those from outside the Union and , I would repeat , for fruit and vegetables in particular .
I welcome the commitment that the EU has made to provide aid to the people of Haiti following the earthquake that hit the country in January .
The Commission &apos;s approach on the matter is expressed in the first objective of our proposal for the multiannual programme to assist tourism in Europe , the Philoxenia programme .
The Europe 2020 Strategy should help Europe recover from the crisis and come out stronger , through smart , sustainable and inclusive growth based on the five EU headline targets , namely promoting employment , improving the conditions for - and public spending on - innovation , research and development , meeting our climate change and energy objectives , improving education levels and promoting social inclusion , in particular through the reduction of poverty .
So we believe that there is a need for active policies on employment - a high level of employment is essential for us to meet the social security bill ; for a guaranteed minimum income for those persons that require it ; for the role of the State in social security provision to be maintained ; for the creation of a European observatory to determine whether poverty and social exclusion are increasing or declining ; and for the Member States to cooperate amongst themselves and with the non @-@ governmental organizations working in this field .
It illustrates the Commission &apos;s interest and the European Parliament would be well advised to use this document .
-There is a framework decision on this issue still with the Council of Ministers .
It is not about whether Sweden will soon become a great wine @-@ growing region - although I do not begrudge you that .
Regarding the issues of offices and heating , and spam on e @-@ mail , let us revert to you and other Members .
This year IMPEL was transformed from an informal network into an international association .
If the already marginal network capacities are not used by freight companies , they will ultimately be eradicated to the disadvantage of all users .
I do not want to labour the point about the Phare programme , and I think we could say the same about the Meda programme , where there are also reports by the Court of Auditors .
Recital G describes the Middle East Quartet ’ s peace plan as ‘ an unparalleled opportunity for the West to restore its credibility in the eyes of Arab and Islamic public opinion ’ .
This means that fully harmonised rules will be in place from 1 January 2012 .
Perhaps he would be prepared to re @-@ examine it , given that the rationale behind it , both on pensions and competence , are not sufficient and that it is worthy of reexamination purely on the grounds of discrimination .
We estimate that , around autumn , this procedure should have been completed , the Intergovernmental Conference should proceed and its work should be completed on time so that the period between the date of enlargement , in May 2004 , and the entry into force of the new institutional framework is as short as possible .
We must not wait for tomorrow , but take decisions now , and I have every confidence in the Czech Presidency that it will keep up the work of the French Presidency .
The main merit of the text of this communication is therefore the fact that it exists .
Last month , we announced that the Union is now ready to sign .
rapporteur . - Mr President , firstly can I thank the Commissioner and his staff , the committee staff , my group staff and my own staff for the work that has gone into this report .
If we follow this approach of pooling our resources and coordinating action at all levels - at European level , at national level , at regional level , at social partners &apos; level - we will emerge from the crisis quicker and , I believe , stronger .
If there is not to be a rude awakening , we must explore the possibilities of full support for the candidate countries in building up their infrastructure and , at the same time , concern ourselves with continuing to bring the weakest regions of the Fifteen up to the average .
This is something that cannot only be the responsibility of the Home Affairs Ministers or of the Commissioner for Justice .
That being said , the introduction of other kinds of criteria such as more selective production methods , which would lead to the implementation of an criterion . This would run counter to the principle that the effects on resources should be analysed on the basis of the decision on technical measures , and not afterwards .
It is significant that these equal conditions are to apply from the first day at work .
Indeed we are now nearing total eradication .
Many of us have criticised America in the past for its failure to work with others .
But when there is a political will these administrative problems can be solved , and so it was .
For this reason , we urgently need to reinforce the complementarity between economic policies and active policies on the labour market and strategies designed to fill the social and economic gap between the regions of the Union . For this reason we agree with the proposal to institutionalize a parliamentary dialogue with the monetary authorities .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , after 30 years , the destructive practice of discards is to be addressed .
It was quite the opposite , from what I understood .
That is why we must work for a more political Europe that reaches out to take care of people ’ s interests .
It is a particular pleasure for me therefore , on behalf of the Commission , to be able to recommend this ambitious package for adoption .
It is essential , in planning future social policies , to focus on the idea of the welfare society , in which all of us , as citizens , have more responsibility and show more solidarity .
By creating a clear path for creative thinking and the resulting ideas , we can all gain intellectual and economic advantages .
Mr President , when we debate European industry there may be cause to ask the question , ‘ where are our leading industries today ? ’
I would conclude by asking myself and asking you this , Madam President : who influenced the decision to regulate lobbies ?
This is going to be more difficult .
But naturally there is also communication between the fixed and the mobile network , and we are seeing that it is possible to telephone via the cable system and so forth .
I welcome the intervention of Parliament in the dispute and hope that an agreement will be reached as soon as possible in order to avoid a deepening conflict .
Indeed so , but it appears to me from the British Presidency ’ s proposals that what is now provided for research is less than what Mr Juncker offered us .
They frequently go unpunished , since the EU has 25 different legal and penal systems .
In addition , high quality must be delivered .
A second weakness in the communication is that it deals with the issue of non @-@ discrimination as a cross @-@ cutting theme in each of the four areas .
In this respect , the role of FAO , the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation , is decisive for the implementation of the rebuilding efforts in the area .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to thank you for the overwhelming support for this important proposal .
Allow me to remind those countries outside the euro zone that there is a danger of their influence declining further .
As a result , this was either confused with or clashed with the debate on the next year &apos;s budget .
Lastly , I would like to mention that , apart from the opportunity given to agricultural diversification , the adoption of this report means that the ban on re @-@ exporting certain products has been lifted .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in critical situations , Europe has always found a way out of a crisis .
This is a particularly topical idea , especially in those regions where the older generation already represents the majority , which is the case in most of Europe .
As I said before , until now the Council has been treated differently , and we believe it should be managed more effectively and more transparently .
Let us get our act together , let us do something , not just for transparency , but for good spending .
There are further , numerous contradictions regarding the relationship between anti @-@ discrimination and equal treatment , as well , because we do know that they mean different things .
We are aware that these requirements in themselves are not the main motivation for the middle classes and for the less affluent to change their cars more frequently .
I agree with the principles of the Spanish Presidency related to measures for controlling climate change .
The continual provocations in the Aegean and the continual disputing of Greece &apos;s territorial integrity demonstrate the kind of community solidarity guaranteed by the Common External Policy , and its imminent institutionalization by the Intergovernmental Conference .
The questions we have been discussing here tonight show that it would be much easier if we had a common legal framework .
The phenomenon of emigration fuelled by situations of crisis and instability has negative implications for the origin country , the destination country and the displaced populations themselves .
I hope I am right in saying that , though I will be prudent enough not to put it to the vote !
Does immigration have to be subject to conditions ?
We therefore have a very important task in front of us .
The main purpose of this is to broaden Article 2 by defining a &apos; public figure &apos; as a person holding an official or non @-@ official position who is deemed to be under threat due to his / her contribution to or impact on public debate .
Today &apos;s decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there .
If not , the stateless chaos known as Somalia will remain .
When we give Croatia the green light for the last round of negotiations and for its last push on the way to full membership , we should point out that this report is addressed to all the countries of south @-@ eastern Europe which have the same expectations .
In societies still dominated by the state &apos;s religious outlook and run along patriarchal lines , the cornerstone of any truly democratic change will be based on the participation of women and respect for human rights .
We know that burying is not the solution when it comes to managing nuclear waste .
These acts are aimed at stabilising the financial markets .
In particular , it is necessary for their special units to be familiar with and cooperate with one other .
The only way you could have done so would have been if there had been a written application prior to starting Question Time .
On the other hand , the bringing together of the directives results in more extensive harmonisation . Therefore , I have abstained from voting .
It is necessary to check pesticide levels in fruit and vegetables , as well as in foodstuffs of animal origin .
That , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , is why the Commission proposes the creation of a disaster fund for the regions and States in case of a major natural disaster .
I assure you that our choice to launch a debate first has proven to be successful .
Mr President , I would like to convey my congratulations to the rapporteur for this report .
The only genetically modified soya bean to be marketed internationally is already approved in the EU ; it is called Round @-@ up Ready , and is a genetic modification that we have approved in the EU under Directive 90 / 220 .
I will raise this in my own political group and would urge other Members to do the same .
This is true even if , as certain high @-@ ranking security officials in Berlin claim , relations with the US Government are being soured by the work of the Munich public prosecutors , who are simply doing their job in the prescribed fashion : this speaks volumes about these people &apos;s mentality and their attitude to the rule of law .
We must open negotiations with Turkey , as we have promised to do , and give Turkey a fair chance .
Thirdly , as the House is aware , the European Union has a special responsibility for reconstruction within the United Nations Civil Administration , UNMIK .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there are economic theories that are astoundingly impervious to reality .
That is an important message and the central message that has emerged from your successful presidency and on that you deserve rich and proper congratulation .
The substances available on the market , although not included in the list of banned substances , are very difficult to control , making it impossible for medical staff to provide assistance as the chemical combinations used have unknown reactions .
It also organised a range of technical meetings with the European Parliament rapporteur , in the desire to reach an agreement with the European Parliament at first reading next month .
Solidarity and responsibility within the European Union can only be enhanced by greater coordination and better supervision .
This is not always evident in Parliament &apos;s resolutions , but it needs to be evident in practice .
We recognise and acknowledge the importance of multilateral cooperation for the promotion of the proper conservation and management of marine biological resources - the subject of this agreement .
Let me say also that the customers are not happy .
Mr President , Baroness Ashton , during the course of this debate , you will hear not only praise , but also criticism .
This is an epidemic in our society .
The re @-@ shaped patterns of world trade have produced nothing like the negative effects that the report would have us believe it has done .
It is of decisive importance to get local business , organisations and other players involved in the practical implementation of programmes .
Unfortunately not all , but many of them travel the world to see its marvels and to discover and learn more about it : Italians want to see what the English are like , the Greeks want to see what the Turks are like and the French want to see their Italian cousins .
We propose to introduce the obligation to prove usage for a time period of at least 25 years .
I welcome Parliament &apos;s interest in this matter , because that really does help us to impress our positions more forcefully on national and regional authorities .
It is binding upon us , and it has been a success that will now hopefully be crowned by the signing of an agreement on mutual legal assistance and extradition .
A further aim was the selection of a number of actions to be taken while waiting for the partnership agreement itself to be ratified by all Members of the Union and for it to come into force .
The fact that there are , today , Members and Commissioners from the Baltic states sitting in this House should encourage us not to be deterred from our course where Tibet is concerned .
This contribution will have a positive impact on the pace of programme implementation , particularly by providing national , regional and local authorities with clearer and less bureaucratic rules that will allow more flexibility in adapting the programmes to the new challenges .
Of course , it will not be Parliament that defines this policy , but the Commission , who have made the first step through this interesting communication , and the Council .
Mr President , I should like to raise a point of order pursuant to Rule 28 ( 2 ) ; in November 1995 I sent you a question within the meaning of Rule 28 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure on the building policy in Brussels , asking you whether , in particular , the Brussels Bench had been contacted by the presidency with regard to Parliament &apos;s buildings policy .
The Commission must finally adopt its own identifiable line here .
As far as asylum is concerned , I should like , Mr McDowell , Commissioner , to send my condolences to the Council for failing to adopt the two directives on the definition of refugees and the procedures for granting and revoking refugee status , which were also issues which the Greek Presidency advanced .
The results of the first call for proposals by the ACP @-@ EU Water Fund show that scarcely 3 % of the projects accepted were projects presented by local authorities .
I will not need to remind you that what we do in the first half of next year will also set the scene for the European elections .
By inching its way along as usual , the House is making progress , admittedly , but in much the same way as a crab .
Mr President , with today &apos;s proceedings the European Parliament is participating in the constitution of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank , a body which , as the preceding hearings have substantiated , will be independent from the instruments of political and democratic control of the Member States and of the European Union itself .
I have taken the floor to tell you what Mrs Boroni wants : namely for the European Parliament - and I am sure that this was among Ms Thors &apos; intentions when she wrote her report and I call upon the Commissioner to see to the matter when he issues the directive - to ensure that the less well @-@ off citizens , whether they are pensioners or not , are able to access the new digital television services of the future free of charge .
That is the real difficulty which we must overcome .
The report is timely given the recent unfortunate events which risk creating further conflict between Islamic and Western culture .
Let me turn to Article 14 in the existing Council legislative text , which was the subject of a question : Member States shall ensure that where producers contribute to the expenditure borne by Member States , this does not result in distortion of competition between producers in different Member States .
Not waiting to react or to respond to events elsewhere but leading the charge as to what will happen .
That is the case with wage reductions , the freezing of admissions to university courses , and the blocking of collective bargaining ; and with the cuts to healthcare , education , social security and a variety of forms of social support .
Even today , journalists around the world are the subject of censorship , physical sanctions and infringements of personal dignity .
&lt; empty &gt;
( FR ) Mr President , I would first like to talk about the scandal that is the so @-@ called &apos; simplified &apos; procedure - in reality a treacherous one - for amending the Treaty .
– The vote on this report gives me an opportunity to pay tribute to that great parliamentarian , Mr Rolf Linkohr , and to acclaim the extraordinary work done by Commissioner Busquin in the course of his term of office , which is now fast nearing its end , to give research a true European dimension .
Mr President , in July my United Kingdom Conservative colleagues were prepared to support you , Mr Barroso , and , despite reservations , your Commission team .
I would now like to look at monetary policy and the question of whether or not the ECB should lower interest rates .
Before the operation date is agreed , the women concerned should therefore also be given an information sheet .
Multinational companies are not those who most need our financial support .
However , it is also true that , through cooperation - which I would even go so far as to call creative - between the Committee on Petitions and the Commission &apos;s services , the consideration of a large number of petitions could be resolved .
The recreation of a better balance between small and large shops must be , therefore , an important purpose of Member States and also the Commission
What other pressure can we exert to compel Belgrade to solve the Kosovo question once and for all ?
Lastly , I would like to refer to the Gallagher report , since the agreement with Mauritania is the most important one concluded with third countries to date .
In actual fact , if the ECOFIN Council on 6 December does not extend the reduced VAT rate , this catastrophic situation will begin in 2006 .
I would offer her my congratulations .
I support the report &apos;s proposal that , in order to reduce these inequalities and streamline the European integration process for all Member States , we need to reduce the period required for funding approval and cut red tape and all the rules and procedures along with it , which needlessly hinder rather than help the European Union &apos;s cohesion policy .
By telling Mr Milosevic that we would not fight on the ground , we invited the vicious and predicted Serbian response on the killing ground of Kosovo .
Joseph Kony , the leader of the so @-@ called Lord &apos;s Resistance Army , spoke again last Monday , telling his men to kill mercilessly anyone who comes within range , including the elderly and children , to spare only pregnant women , to kill priests and missionaries in cold blood and to beat up nuns in cold blood .
If Syria is willing to engage in constructive dialogue with us , then I call upon them to indicate their goodwill by resuming the dialogue that has already tentatively begun , and to make it possible for us to address , albeit perhaps in small ways , with matters such as border issues , and to demonstrate to us their readiness to return to the negotiating table .
The Council tried to sidestep the involvement of Parliament in the legislative process by using a different legal basis from the one laid down in the Treaty .
In my opinion , we have to have a more positive vision and I think that that must be our approach to addressing the problems and proposals for action in order to ensure economic growth in the Union in the years ahead .
Liberalisation and competition should be introduced within this large European market .
Finally , I would like to mention the situation in Palestine .
This is precisely why I understand and support the issue raised by the Chairman of our Committee on Fisheries , Mr Varela Suanzes ­ Carpegna .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - ( HU ) Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Manders , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great achievement that a second @-@ reading agreement has been reached on the proposal concerning a regulation on the naming of textile fibres and the related labelling of textile products .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I sometimes wonder how it is that sensible , or at least justifiable initiatives like this one - the amendment of the environmental impact directive - can be devalued in this way by formalities such as unduly short deadlines for transposition .
We must involve civil society and stakeholders to uphold principles of transparency and accountability and to ensure best practice .
– Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am speaking in place of Mr Podestà , the Chairman of the Delegation to the EU @-@ Romania Joint Parliamentary Committee , and therefore my speech will deal particularly with the situation in that country .
We ought to take their arguments seriously at least .
Therefore , I wonder if the Commission and the Council can report on how work on increased trade and reduced tariffs can progress under the Swedish Presidency .
The Commission will close the debate on this first point .
For instance , let me ask one question with regard to Hungary : how is it possible that we are talking about childhood starvation in a country with exceptional agricultural resources ?
At one time no one could have foreseen the extent to which emissions would start to increase , and now around half of all emissions come from the developing countries , mainly China and India .
Will you talk to them as soon as possible and report back to us ?
I was somewhat surprised by this because a candidate country should also be bringing its visa policy closer to that of the European Union , not moving in the opposite direction .
The third and most important line of approach , and it is on this that the question focuses which I and my honourable friends have submitted to the European Commission , is to rapidly develop public and private investment in research , in order to develop better and cheaper technologies in connection with alternative forms of energy .
Another thing that we can do to stimulate demand and to help and lead the motor industry through this crisis is to ensure that the conditions of international competition , too , are also not violated .
Thank you , Mr Vitorino , for the information you have given me .
Mr President , Mr Alavanos , I can only repeat what I have just emphasised , that of course no third country - which means not Turkey either - can have a veto in this EU enlargement process .
We have not given any consideration to the recovery of currencies , but this is the element which initially is going to come into play most quickly .
This proposal for a regulation is in the process of being examined by one of the Council ’ s working groups , which primarily focuses on structural measures .
Madam President , Mr Barón Crespo , Chairman of the Socialist Group , also directed a comment to me .
The storage of data , in particular , is regarded as a vital tool for the authorities in investigating and combating terrorism , although the law already provides for access – subject to a court order – to those data stored by telephone service providers for billing purposes .
( Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure )
Mr President , my political group has tabled its own resolution and amendments to the resolution of the other political groups .
On that , Mr Poettering and I agree .
The Kurdish problem will continue to get worse and to come up before us so long as the Turkish authorities persist in their flagrant violation of the fundamental human rights of an entire people , stubbornly refusing to progress towards the search for a political and peaceful solution of the Kurdish issue by direct negotiations with all the representative bodies of the Kurdish people .
At the same time , more mass redundancies are on the cards in important sectors of the economy , such as transport , tourism etc . Employment policies have become an exercise in apportioning unemployment , even more so in the guidelines for 2002 .
Yes , the real picture looks quite different .
The idea is that fingerprinting 14 @-@ year @-@ old children is completely unacceptable .
We are all grateful to the Vice @-@ President for setting up a high @-@ level working party with a view to achieving results in the short term too .
It is important , therefore , that consumers are aware of how much energy is used by their equipment , and so I think they have the right for that information to be on the labels .
This initiative is intended to update , clarify and streamline rules for granting visas to seamen in transit .
Consequently , we need a global strategy for addressing such problems .
In this context , it should be pointed out that the Seville European Council of 21 and 22 June asked the Council and the Commission , within the scope of their respective competences , to give absolute priority to certain measures in the fight against illegal immigration .
We can see from the statistics that we in Europe are manufacturing cars that are just too big .
Developing countries do not have the resources to combat climate change that we have in Europe .
Contempt for ethical and moral principles and disregard of the meaning of fasting can even stunt personal development by making a person dependent on his or her blood sugar level and on visual and taste sensations .
We have a special financial instrument – ENPI – the European Neighbourhood Partnership Instrument .
The same argument obliges us to reject Amendments Nos 22 , 24 and 27 to 30 .
If in the end I am proved wrong then angels swearing that I was right all the time will do me no good.&apos;
Those are my thoughts , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen .
The discussion on the future design and organisation of this work took up a great deal of time and energy and was carried out under an undue amount of pressure .
I am able to say today that , despite all the differences of political opinion in the committee , our real and overriding concern was to bring the facts to light and , above all , to come to the conclusions that are needed if we are to avoid such a disaster repeating itself .
As Mayor of Bilbao in the eighties I witnessed a battle amongst companies eager to improve and increase their networks .
It is important and right that the fundamental issue that Mr Rothley and I have raised should be decided rather than continuing to be postponed .
Two is better than none , which is what happened before .
Completely contrary to Commission regulations and the laws of individual states , public tender procedures are not carried out , claims are made for payment of ineligible expenditure , recipients are unable to support the legitimacy of overheads or staff costs , while controls are also faltering .
Now that Signor Frattini has left the ivory towers of the EU and has a job in the real political world , he has changed his tune .
There are desperate people , but I am not convinced that desperation is the only basis for suicide bombers – they are also recruited and exploited .
The EU will keep up the pressure to ensure that they are .
Yet there is still much to be done in relations between Europeans and Africans .
The Commission is sensitive to the desire for clarification which it furthermore took into account in its explanatory memorandum .
The tragic events of 11 September 2001 will also prompt us to develop closer ties with the United States , which will go beyond the established mechanisms for cooperation .
No one had conceived of using a fully loaded , large passenger plane as a weapon .
Unfortunately , I found it necessary to vote against the report on the subject by Mrs Castex because so many key amendments were rejected .
I was pleased to hear the Commissioner say that 49 countries , plus the European Community , have already done so .
Aid is unobjectionable , but it must be aid for all .
2 .
- Before the vote
From the short @-@ term and medium @-@ term perspective , it is important to control price shocks , especially in the area of foodstuffs .
There are those who say that it would have been better to do all this beforehand .
This will increase confidence of all groups in the region and their commitment to maintaining order .
I think that we should pursue this initiative and I see that this issue is also on the agenda of this session .
In fact , I saw the sign on the door and originally , the room was probably meant for a different purpose . So maybe we are talking about a temporary solution .
This policy of trying to make Europe into a fortress at this time of crisis , which is a triple crisis in terms of food , finance and energy , is not understood by everyone , because our work is poor and heading in the wrong direction .
However , all of us in this Chamber share responsibility for the European Parliament ’ s plenary again and again adopting the resolutions presented to us by the Committee on Agriculture .
It is fitting that , in a report on citizenship , the citizen &apos;s voice , via the NGOs , was heeded in drawing up the final report .
Your inability to get this through is a lamentable sign of just how resistant to change everything here is , but you are passing on the baton to the German Presidency of the Council , and so one can indeed hope that it may be enabled to make headway against the red tape that it has announced its intention of doing something about - &apos; red tape &apos; being understood to mean bureaucracy , unnecessary regulations and the difficulty of getting one &apos;s hands on grants - while at the same time reducing the numbers of civil servants .
I had a choice : I could ask for everybody &apos;s opinions and take no action , or act and then check whether the others agreed .
It is true that it took the loss of the Estonia to give this issue the momentum it needed but I would also pay tribute to the way in which Commissioner Kinnock , since he became Commissioner , has ensured that the issue of safety in general has remained at the top of his agenda .
Something similar will happen in this case , in the sense that while our group , as Mr Langen said , appeared to have a majority , it will take only a few more rules of this kind before we actually do have a majority .
So , if you want to prevent conflicts and manage the crisis which already exists , you should state very loudly that UN Resolution No 1244 applies to the letter .
In view of the novel nature of this structure , ambitious provisions with regard to transparency and budgetary and financial accountability need to be applied .
This requires staff training , more modern recruitment methods and , above all , openness and public control .
The negotiations in progress between Israel and the Palestinian Authority are specifically concerned with defining these frontiers .
Economic and monetary union consists of two essential sides , like a medal : the monetary side and the non @-@ monetary side .
In any case , this idea must be encouraged , and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a Community corpus iuris in the Treaties .
When such things occur , we can only praise the worth of the person who has planned and drawn up the document .
I salute and thank you for that .
Indeed , very often , the judicial authorities do not take into account the absolute immunity of the Member in question - the European Parliament must understand that - in carrying out the processes laid down in Article 68 ( 2 ) of the Constitution , particularly where the - albeit indirect - interception of telephone communications is concerned .
The creation of this taxation , of either the Tobin type or the more realistic type proposed by Professor Lauré , could prove to be politically opportune , at least due to its symbolism rather than its low rate . This is because it would basically mean that politics was regaining a foothold in an area from which it has been excluded by operators whose profits are proportional to the degree of resignation of States .
I have got to know her as a very good colleague , and I would say that she is also a convinced European .
The lies were served up in bad faith to feed groups of activists and do not correspond in any objective way to what was said in the parliamentary hearings .
Please be assured that the Commission has the support of a large majority of Members of this House .
I would also like to take the opportunity to express my condolences to the Nigerian people in connection with the death of the president .
In order to put an end to this situation , I worked , during the drafting of the 2011 budget , on the creation of a line of payment appropriations specific to the Globalisation Adjustment Fund .
But if we have a common interest in the environment , a common interest in the economic welfare of the European Union , a common tourism policy and so on , it is realistic to think that we ought to have a common policy so far as forestry is concerned .
The developing countries in question , which are our main concern , have indicated that they would be willing to look at the amendment to Article 31 that we have proposed .
The family doctor or the multinational companies that keep plundering the health sector ?
It is not possible for such serious action to be taken purely on the basis of electoral considerations - unless the fact is that the hawks in the Israeli army are daily gaining ground in Tel Aviv .
It is a fact .
The purpose of my speech is mainly to state that we support the amendments the rapporteur has tabled .
The truth is therefore precisely the opposite of what was suggested : it is in the interests of safety that we intend to propose a system that all the governments have asked us to provide .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to thank you very much for the opportunity to report on the latest steps in the effort to end this BSE crisis that affects all of us .
Fifthly , we should stress the need to support vulnerable social groups , as this will mitigate the reduction in their income and prevent their social and economic marginalisation .
There is therefore pressure on the MEP concerned to take up his or her place again as soon as possible , to the detriment of the MEP &apos;s family and children .
People will be none the wiser , because we do not have labelling .
We have the clear sensation that in Europe the issues of occupation and industrial democracy , of a different and qualified role for employees , had become commonplaces , slogans to be used only to display goodwill which then do not find any concrete expression .
The only practical change being made by the nationalisation of our banks and by these huge bail @-@ outs is that , instead of cutting taxes to help people through the tough times , we are loading an enormous new additional burden on them .
But it says something further . It says that everybody else , particularly the national governments , must do their duties : they must maintain the evolution of salaries linked to productivity , introduce measures in terms of the transparency of prices and reform their structures in order to increase productivity , in order to give the European Central Bank a margin , an additional margin , in the event that it is considered necessary to reduce interest rates , particularly if we want to bring interest rates into line with European export needs .
Lastly , we need to go further in our development aid policies towards developing countries .
Of course , it is too early to say whether this will mean the end of terrorist activity by the Tamil Tigers .
We hope that all of this will be introduced with the reform and that we will have coherent , complementary and coordinated policies in order to achieve greater efficiency .
Now to the question of the further measures which can be adopted as a result of the crisis . I think it is a good thing that so many proposals have been tabled .
( HU ) Thank you , Mr President , Commissioner .
There are - and I say this quite openly and clearly - two amendments by Mrs Palacio and a number of other colleagues , Amendments Nos 39 and 40 , which call for unanimity on this point and that means that there will again be a right of veto .
We have noted a reduction in the pace of growth , increased budget deficits and a dramatic increase in unemployment .
The Unesco Convention must be applied not only to securing cultural diversity with regard to third countries , but also as a matter of the utmost urgency in our own European law .
Our dialogue , and this was a point which Mr Galeote Quecedo referred to , will embrace the fundamental principles of human rights and democracy with an honesty and appreciation born , I hope , out of close partnership .
I thus share the rapporteur &apos;s view that it would be advisable to adopt a system of &apos; joint liability &apos; at European level , under which the main contractor would be encouraged to check that subcontractors comply with relevant legislation .
It is vital that our taxpayers , Europe ’ s citizens , should be able to see that we are careful with money , that we conceal nothing and that we are trying to prevent abuses .
On behalf of the Commission , I would like to underline that the ban on conventional cages which was adopted in 1999 represents an important improvement for animal welfare in the European Union .
That system is very important and is already used in our cooperation with China and other countries , but we really need to enhance it in order to face all the challenges mentioned here .
What measures , benefits and activities connected with the accession process directly affect women who work in the fields in the accession countries ?
Mr President , Commissioner Fischler , the Commission appears to have made a sound proposal , but in actual fact , this is not a sound proposal .
We noted a certain arbitrariness in this lack of association , and so we also undertook some analysis .
Consideration must also be given to the fact that there is an economic crisis going on , which will , in any case , influence how labour @-@ related directives are applied in the national territories of Europe .
We think that the rent paid in excess , which amounts to 10 % of the annual rent , should be reclaimed from Strasbourg city council .
This gives them more chances of sustaining these habits and preventing obesity as a result .
I believe that no person has the right to take another human being &apos;s life .
It is also proposed that customs should be given powers to open private consignments where it is suspected that they contain alcohol or tobacco .
I share Mr Watson ’ s view that it is time we looked for a legal migration channel .
My group will therefore demand that the Council &apos;s common position be rejected by a roll @-@ call vote and , furthermore , will propose introducing a specific amendment for a study to be undertaken .
( SK ) Madam President , I , too , would like to emphasise the historical importance of Security Council resolution 1325 for peace and for security policy .
We respect the outcome of the referendum on the independence of South Sudan , scheduled to take effect on 9 July 2011 , as an expression of the democratic will of the Sudanese people .
Of course , you will be aware that we are seeking to enhance the Pact still further .
Why are we not involved in all the discussions with the United States on security and privacy ?
The Commission is very aware of Parliament &apos;s concerns and it shares your view in this matter .
It is clear , concise and to the point .
I do not believe that the European nations have strategic security interests that should be separated from those of its transatlantic and other allies .
This proposal destroys people &apos;s lives and their communities in remote regions .
The common agricultural policy is the European Union &apos;s main common policy .
The honourable Member is correct in stating that the proposed amnesty law , which is still only a proposal before both the Serbian Parliament and the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , will not cover anyone convicted of offences considered to be acts of terrorism .
It is precisely that Pashtoon agenda that gives rise to the very real danger of a general revolt against a regime imposed from outside : an Afghan tradition .
However , what we can do of course is to judge the implications if , for example , Öcalan were not given unrestricted access to lawyers of his choice , or if international trial observers were not given full and unrestricted access .
Thus , the Commission is right to produce a wider integration strategy involving countries and geographical areas located to the east and south of the enlarged Union at the very time when the accession treaties for the ten new Member States are being signed .
In this regard we also welcome the responsible role played by the OSCE .
It would be useful if the negotiations about Macedonia ’ s accession – for which the Committee on Foreign Affairs has appointed me as rapporteur – were to run parallel with Croatia , which also has its roots in former Yugoslavia , so that we can welcome the Bulgarians and Macedonians to the European Union simultaneously .
I hope this observatory will be able to find employment for the twenty million unemployed .
While the Article 31 Expert Group had concluded that there was no need for individual monitoring of the Commission &apos;s own staff and contractors sent to the region , the Commission &apos;s medical services nonetheless proposed a check @-@ up and urine analysis programme for the staff members concerned .
There is now an alternative to the old neoliberal pre @-@ crisis killer argument that &apos; there is no alternative &apos; when it comes to bringing the financial market back into line and restructuring it .
We would therefore appreciate the Presidency being present at 9 p.m. in order to explain to us what happened at the Agriculture Council last night on the issue on which Mr Papayannakis &apos; report is based .
– Pursuant to the rules of procedure I will ask if anyone wishes to speak in favour of this request for a report and if anyone wishes to speak against .
It is self @-@ evident that no condition of this kind applies , of course , to refugees for , if it did , it would be contrary to the conventions .
Something that this House has had to discuss over and over again during the last few plenary sessions is the threats facing minorities in the European Union , among them a growing potential for extremism , not least of a right @-@ wing nature , for xenophobia and anti @-@ Semitism , for minorities , even in the European Union , are increasingly under threat , under attack , and in need of protection .
We have virtually abandoned the Stability and Growth Pact ; we have begun a predictable and wholescale retreat from the Services Directive ; we voted in this House to end the opt @-@ out on the Working Time Directive , and meanwhile the Commission is preparing to unveil another 900 new directives : more red tape , more bureaucracy , more interference in the lives of our citizens .
It is very much in Europe &apos;s interest that security and stability in this important state should be maintained , and the EU should therefore help Jordan as far as possible .
I want to be very clear on this .
It can also be interpreted as evidence of the overly liberal practice of considering solutions involving the use of computer programs to be inventions , pursuant to Article 52 ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) of the European Patent Convention signed in Munich .
Furthermore , whilst upholding every individual ’ s right to religious freedom , we need to declare with conviction that the enforcement of the in a State or part of it cannot be accepted by the Member States of the European Union .
We must therefore welcome the commitment shown by all the political groups and players concerned to reach an agreement .
In the short term we need to expand UNEP &apos;s role in the World Summit implementation .
Ambition depends on two things .

References to mismanagement , delays , late payment , millions of ÅCU being granted for non @-@ subsidisable equipment , waste and irregularities abound both in the Staes report and the opinions .
According to the provisions of the bilateral agreement , it is the responsibility of the customs administrations of the EU Member States to check the origin of goods with the Israeli authorities through the post @-@ verification procedure .
This is therefore a clear opening .
Secondly , here are a few plain truths about Hezbollah .
The Council and the Commission therefore need to make a greater effort to ensure that the Turkish Government observes the Copenhagen criteria , in other words , that it promotes human rights and the rule of law .

. Whilst the volume of road traffic has trebled in the last three decades , the number of deaths has halved .
The information from the current financial framework illustrates that , instead of being used to satisfy grassroots needs , the funds available under the euro @-@ unifying budget are being directed against them , in order to support the profitability of the monopoly groups .
. ( PT ) I wish to congratulate Mrs Pack on her excellent report , which I fully support .
A potential source of these payments could be the EUR 7.7 billion reserve against the payment ceiling of the multi @-@ annual financial framework .
The sitting then continued as usual , without any debate .
On the subject of an open coordination method , I , too , along with a great many others , also wish to be taken seriously .
Furthermore , we ask the Commission , by means of appropriate solutions , to support the idea that the structural allocation should be considered a spending objective .
I would like to say a few words about the terrible earthquake that struck Kashmir on the morning of 8 October 2005 and which , as Baroness Nicholson &apos;s report describes , had a devastating impact on the lives of the Kashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control , especially in Pakistan @-@ administered Kashmir and the North West Frontier Province .
It should be noted here that we seek this freedom of movement not only for citizens of the European Union , but also for citizens of third countries who are legally resident in the Union .
That is the ultimate deadline .
To be a true Union , it is essential to retain the sense of Community that was , not without reason , the original name given to the construction of Europe .
The General Affairs Council , which met yesterday in Luxembourg , demonstrated the widespread confusion about the proposals on the reform of the common fisheries policy in all the countries where this sector is of economic , social and cultural importance .
When the Council adopted a directive for the first time in 1984 on the radiation protection of persons undergoing medical examination or treatment , it was in recognition of the fact that this was by far the largest man @-@ made source of radiation to which people were exposed .
I congratulate Mr Provera .
Indeed , it is when we feel too secure that terror strikes again .
Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers ( see Annex ) .
That is certainly what will take the longest time before it has become a natural part of the political debate at all levels , but it is something for which we must strive .
I should like to highlight the importance of :
I think this is a step forward that we must follow through .
Surely this is an approach which the Commission should have adopted long ago ?
B5 @-@ 0380 / 2000 by Mr Van den Berg and Mrs Kinnock , on behalf the Group of the Party of European Socialists ;
Sport is art , art is sport .
However , some of the oral amendments tabled during the vote have made it even more inacceptable , particularly the reference to the position of the UN Security Council on the establishment of an air exclusion zone in Libya , which , as we are aware , is masking the war which is being waged against this country .
We are well aware of how they are to be interpreted , and I could not contemplate taking responsibility for any breach at all , either of the spirit or of the letter , of any convention whatsoever .
You only have to read the text to see that different demands are made within the framework of the directive .
I would like to thank Mrs Starkevičiūtfor the report and Mr Lehne and Mrs Harms for the draft resolution .
I would like to conclude , Mr President , by saying how pleased I am that the immigration and asylum pact has been adopted .
The recognition of same @-@ sex marriages , on the other hand , is an area that comes under the jurisdiction of the Member States .
The country that is being fought over now is Ukraine .
On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , I wish to explain our abstention from the vote on the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance &apos;s amendment on a tax on the model of the Tobin tax .
Similarly , if we look at the Indian sub @-@ continent , a growing population accompanied by deforestation is causing flooding which is undermining effective water supply and dykes .
Thank you .
I ask Parliament to at least understand that all the working papers – some of which reflect the shifting positions of Member States – could , on the one hand , be thrown open to public scrutiny ; but on the other hand , the character of those papers would probably be altered if they were to be the subject of constant scrutiny .
It would be nice if , at least occasionally , we were to honour the legal principle of audiatur et altera pars , instead of blaming everything on the Croats , which is what always happens here .
You mentioned the free movement of knowledge .
Lastly , Madam President , there must be greater concern under the cohesion policy for protection of the natural world .
European patients have rights which must also be protected by law , so that they can have the corresponding social cover wherever they may be in the Europe of free movement .
A preparatory meeting was held in June last year under the British presidency .
In adopting the regulations on the structural funds in July 1993 the Council determined the criteria that would be used to determine which regions would qualify for Objective 1 status , the most underdeveloped regions in the Union .
Mr President , I want to express my thanks for a good report .
I do believe that sport should and can become part and parcel of the strategies for sustainable development of our regions , municipalities , cities and villages with the EU assistance .
Our objective in Europe must be to achieve competitive production costs in spite of higher labour charges .
The risk to security is a similarly dangerous consequence of this situation .
I repeat , this is in Rule 7 ( 8 ) of our Rules of Procedure .
the European Council report and Commission statement on the European Council meeting of 15 and 16 June 2001 in Göteborg and
The debate is closed .
He was not a dictator then .
My vote in favour is aimed at supporting all livestock farmers facing bankruptcy .
I join with the Commissioner in admiring the actions taken by the European Central Bank .
Finally , national patent offices and their participation should be restricted by clear quantitative limits .
People are becoming more aware , and this is leading to discussions concerning antibiotics , salmonella and additives .
Consequently , the trade union confederations CNTG and USTG became the main force in the fight for democracy .
This is difficult to achieve and it would be a pity to raise expectations for them only to be disappointed .
Denmark does not subject to national taxation the prize money awarded in connection with the Nordic prize for literature , nor the Nobel Prize .
I would like to point out that there is nothing the Ombudsman can do in over 30 % of cases .
Seventy per cent of mothers in the UK drink .
My impression is that he does not accept any of them , but he could at least tell us in a word , so that we do not leave the House without having understood .
I want also to remind us all that the European Parliament &apos;s support for the liberalisation process of telecommunications goes hand in hand with the introduction and implementation of universal service .
The result of the talks proves that social dialogue can work at European level .
The draft also constitutes a threat to the competitiveness of airlines and may cause a radical deterioration in the already difficult financial situation of many European aviation companies .
Where , exceptionally , the discharge resolution is deferred , the Commission is to respond very quickly in order to remove the causes of the impediment .
That would be unreasonable , without question , since such an expensive item normally should be repaired first .
No solution can be found that transports us immediately , overnight , into a drug @-@ free society .
This is the European Year of Education through Sport , and in this context we can , and should , convey the fact that sport has a key role to play in the process .
The Group of the Party of European Socialists also supports Mrs Fontaine in her declaration made in Lisbon to the effect that , I quote , &quot; The European Parliament is committed to the social model in all its aspects &quot; .
Nevertheless the resolution is necessary and it is important that we state our case .
A very restrained thank you as I am none the wiser .
The report also sets out a number of points to accelerate the integration of the WEU into the EU , strengthening the common defence profile that Mr Tindemans so earnestly desires .
The G8 is not an institution but it is still bound to be transparent in its work and decisions and to make them public .
I would like to welcome the initiative from Finland , which envisages better legislation , in addition to compliance with the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity .
Accordingly , this challenge also relates to Member States already in the Schengen area .
I believe EU citizens are happy to go along with this , but the money must be used in the best possible way .
I have therefore tabled this amendment again in the hope that the majority of Members will now understand this point of detail , which is , in fact , more than just a detail .
( PT ) Mr President , first of all , we should look at the context in which we are having this debate .
Having said that , I should like however to stress that the Commission will not omit in its proposals for collaboration between the European Union and ASEAN to stress this as an essential point .
It is extremely important and it is very important to support the attempts of NAFO to halt this very problematic activity of non @-@ contracting parties .
Let us begin with the decision to tax steel imports at rates of up to 30 % and to impose quotas .
I would like to say to Mrs Attwooll that fishing is indeed an economic activity , and one that needs to be profitable , which is now ceasing to be the case , therefore perhaps we need more economists in fisheries than there are at present , to analyse these issues in more detail .
We want to emphasise , though , that what is particularly relevant at the moment is the obvious shortfall in resources , a situation which is entirely due to the lack of political will and not to a need to reform the system of own resources .
We must respond to the deep wounds of the civil war , and enhance national governance , while quickly introducing new measures of structural reform .
We look to the spring Council in March to reverse the failures of recent times and put Europe firmly on a free market and enterprise @-@ driven path .
Wealth next to misery .
Some Members of this House were concerned that following the decision of the Court of Justice we had not got the appropriations for the twelfth part @-@ session on the line ; they were fully in reserve .
At the start of the Brussels European Council , however , we must not lose sight of the serious threats to the CAP posed by a new , historic enlargement of the European Union .
It is insufficiently precise .
I must once again point to the Commission &apos;s delay in presenting this issue to the European Parliament and point out that the European Union is going to be paying the first portion of the financial payments to Gabon at least six months late .
Had the consultation period been extended I think we might have got much more robust answers as a basis for a better review of the Directive .
The public needs to know that .
The same applies to you , Mr Pirker , in every sense .
Mr Ryan , as to what we will do in the areas of financial regulation to which he has alluded - the proposals on credit rating agencies and the capital requirements directive - he put forward a legitimate question concerning what the European Union was doing to address the problems in the real economy because although the changes to do with financial regulation has undoubtedly been timely in areas where there was a lacuna in financial regulation , it in itself is not going to galvanise and kick start the European economy .
We need leaner , simplified procedures .
Mr Lambrias was a Member of this House for 15 years , between 1984 and 1999 .
The six months &apos; delay caused by the Council and Commission is most regrettable .
In 1992 weekly demonstrations began in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul with the words : the Japanese Government should be ashamed , not us .
The third lesson is that Europe must provide itself with a European stability mechanism to protect our social market economy .
President Barroso , thank you for your presence here in plenary with us , for all your answers , for the very lively discussion , and chiefly for your words on the very important EU response to the tragedy in Japan .
A more detailed scrutiny of Turkish legislation and its approximation to the acquis will be in the forefront .
EU aid of up to four per cent of gross domestic product per year is a large amount for the new Member States , but a modest amount for the existing ones .
When the referendum on Swedish membership of the European Union was organised in 1994 , it was made clear that we were not obliged to join the currency union if we voted in favour of EU membership .
When will the Council next have an opportunity to vote on changing its rules of procedure to provide for it to meet in public when it deliberates on draft legislative acts ?
One thing that should be borne in mind in this regard is that sales success is not an indication of the innovativeness of a medicinal product ; nor of the outlay on research .
The Commission , like Parliament , is convinced that being well @-@ informed about the state of protection of fundamental rights is crucial to our being able to assess the quality of this protection , and this assessment must always be rigorous and efficient .
The Council will of course carefully consider all of the European Parliament &apos;s amendment proposals and based on this it will assess whether or not to incorporate them into the final version of the draft proposal .
I firmly believe that , if the group of economically stronger Member States , such as France and Germany , in particular , found the will to unify accounting rules and to create a common accounting and taxation system , it would be possible , through enhanced cooperation under Article 20 TEU , to lay the foundations for a common accounting system , which other Member States could gradually join .
The European Union will request that similar stress tests be carried out in the neighbouring countries and worldwide , at both existing and planned nuclear plants and , in this regard , full use should be made of the relevant international organisations .
I would like to welcome the arrival of the Irish Presidency , because fate and the timetable have placed you right at the European Union ’ s important political crossroads .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioner , do we not have a duty to protect the European textile and clothing industry ?
I am referring specifically to the energy projects approved as part of the programme to aid economic recovery implemented during the Czech Presidency last year .
It will be a big step forward when the area between Parliament and the station , the famous &apos; dalle &apos; , is finally landscaped in a more welcoming and friendly way . That means releasing the necessary resources , which will require closer cooperation between the Espace Léopold society , Parliament - in its moral role - and the relevant Belgian authorities .
However , I would like to praise the courage of the first rapporteur , Mr Schmitt , who refused to have his name associated with such excesses .
I think that these reports are a means for Parliament to express its determination to conclude the work on Agenda 2000 before the end of this legislative period , and I am grateful for the many clear statements made in this debate to the effect that Parliament shall assume its responsibility .
In Kosovo , the citizens wanted the European Union to ? .
I repeat my example of Iceland , which is not in the euro but which has been through all that .
At the outset I sought a global reform based on two elements : the fair treatment of Members of the House based on equality , and transparency on allowances to be based on costs incurred .
The advantages that economic agents are expected to gain in terms of legal certainty and a reduction in the cost of transactions very much depends on the clarity , predictability and stability of the rules .
They will want to offer their citizens the Charter .
The Youth on the Move initiative is one of the platforms which may help to promote youth employment .
The purely economic repercussions of the earthquakes are great and it would seem difficult , if not impossible , to expect Turkey to overcome all that without any generous help from outside , without our active support .
I am not satisfied that the Commissioner has given a full reply to all the questions .
in writing . - ( FR ) As regards the reports on the placing of plant protection products on the market and the sustainable use of pesticides , I followed the very responsible line of my political group .
This is not an oral amendment , for we do not wish to add or remove any words .
The directive creates a &apos; light &apos; monopoly , a &apos; soft &apos; monopoly , and the processes of concentration in terms of energy supply will be intensified .
However - and this is my third point , which is a very important one - there is a limit to the absorptive capacity in Haiti , which I believe I talked about with some of you .
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force , the EU has had very wide powers in terms of controlling migration flows .
I therefore wholeheartedly endorse the rapporteur &apos;s proposal to include the actions financed from the World Fund in the Commission &apos;s annual report .
To do this would be to go down the road towards not only standardisation but the lowering of standard quality with regard to food , in the direction of a loss of taste and savours , in a sort of Anglo @-@ Saxonization of gastronomy .
After all , full employment is once again a possibility at last .
The Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group has tabled a number of amendments proposing the abolition of the amending budgets and transfers .
That is subsidiarity .
In most cases , land registry offices in Europe , and in Africa , are public , although it will be difficult in Africa .
Without funding we will not get this technology up and running .
More generally , we all have a commitment of solidarity towards each other , based on a desire to protect and promote the wider European interest .
I know that he is standing in for Mr Dimas and could not help but read out what was given to him , but I think we need rather more than that .
The vote will take place on Thursday .
None of us would accept similar interference in his own country .
We have human rights clauses in all of our cooperation agreements , and yet we do not have effective monitoring and temporary suspension mechanisms , because those clauses would really allow us to ensure respect for democracy in third countries .
Finally , we believe that the situation in the region can only be normalized if , during this conference , all the problems are tackled .
The full realisation of a competitive Single Market , without barriers , and with definite advantages for the daily lives of workers , students , pensioners and the public in general , along with businesses , is essential to relaunching the European economy and stimulating growth , competitiveness and sustainability in the EU .
Together with the condemnatory chatter of the European Union and the escalation of legislative and other measures against terrorism , we need to develop our own communication strategy with the moderate elements in these societies .
. I will be in a better position to answer that question after the meetings to be held in April as part of the ASEM process .
Now the cameras have gone away , yet the economic siege continues .
We are now , if you look at the public opinion polls , one of the more Euro @-@ positive countries in Europe .
Many fishermen are organized on a family basis , many are share fishermen and many are not employees in the sense that we would understand it .
With regard to enlargement , in 1997 the Commission will deliver its opinions on the applicant countries .
Finally , I would observe that the Commissioner confirms full commitment to protect workers &apos; rights and to fight against social dumping .
Health services are one thing - there is the question of subsidiarity - and public health protection is another because , as you know , viruses and various diseases and bio @-@ terrorism do not recognise borders and can pass from country to country , from Member State to Member State and we must be able to respond in a coordinated manner .
It must be worldwide .
With regard to the Fund for Rural Development , we are very hopeful , but we know that it only concerns compensation , which is very positive because financial compensation is needed .
It seems to me that we are on the verge of agreeing on all this , and what the Commissioner has said has been extremely helpful .
We devoted three hours of heated debate yesterday to the question of where to put the prisoners and those whose crimes have not been proven .
However , the Commission is obviously prepared to take part in formulating a general Interinstitutional Agreement as soon as possible .
The President also emphasised , it is true , that the next European Council will take place after the elections - and also said , and many of us reiterated the sentiment , that this European Council should appoint the next Commission President .
Mr President , we are hurtling at breakneck speed towards a situation where millions of eggs will fail to comply with European rules .
We could certainly have gone a little further .
As the report says , it takes the Community institutions , and in particular the Commission , an extraordinary amount of time to monitor the application of European law .
Before the highly important vote we will soon be holding on relations between Europe and the United States , I would urgently ask for the exchange of letters between Mr Bush and Mr Prodi to be made available to all Members .
The reality is that if you do not have a job , you cannot pay your bills or support yourself .
( IT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to highlight some key points of the position of the European Parliament , and in particular of the Socialist Group , as regards the broad guidelines for the completion of the Lisbon cycle for growth and employment .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
It contains a number of important declaration .
Putting money into a bottomless pit at will without accompanying measures can be dangerous .
Or , to be more precise , it adjusts its finances in favour of a sealing off of its borders , in favour of hi @-@ tech military projects and in favour of a more and more sophisticated monitoring of Europe &apos;s citizens .
I very much hope this will happen , because the compromise that has been reached is an excellent balance , which I hope the Commission will take into account .
I have a few suggestions on how missions can be made effective without undue cost .
These agreements are also important because they are designed to eliminate the pirate vessels which , as you all know , are looting fish stocks from international waters . Above all , though , the agreements look towards a concept of co @-@ operation and development , while at the same time helping to establish hygienic and sanitary practices in the countries concerned .
Mr President , I have voted against the Wallis report because it goes against the tradition that Parliament does not address the question of whether immunity should be lifted where opinions constituting an offence are expressed , or are alleged to have been expressed .
A global trading nation that is very proud of its recent history does not belong , does not fit in with this club and , from your perspective , we are like the dog in the manger , are we not ?
The discussions we had then show that the question of burden @-@ sharing demands further consideration .
The Commission has said that it may be dropped , but at the moment we do not feel that there is any reason not to go ahead with this , so as far as we are concerned the directive should contain the reference to 25 % .
Therefore , I hope that you will present a proper proposal in 2013 , as a cabotage restriction is absurd in a European internal market of 27 countries .
It is for that very reason that I voted in favour of this report .
This was reaffirmed by the reaction to Russia &apos;s legitimate decision to suspend gas supplies .
Those very European Councils requested that the Broad economic policy guidelines take account of long @-@ term employment programmes and employment guidelines .
This is something that has not actually been requested by the sector , something the implications of which have not been properly looked into and something that the Commission , the Council , the trade unions , the consumer organisations , and the Association of European railway companies do not want to see approved today .
This is a crime against humanity .
I believe that we will have to see how the mechanism for the settlement of disputes can be adjusted according to the needs .
To conclude I warmly welcome this report and I am sure that this Parliament will consider the forthcoming proposals in the same positive way as it has the White Paper on revitalization and indeed the communication on rail freight freeways .
The world can no longer afford a poor agreement on climate .
Yet we have nothing to celebrate .
The system has to be clear and transparent .
Today we are going further , and also asking for an assessment of the effects of monetary union on the stability of the international financial system .
When we hear all this stuff about how the European Constitution is now legal because all these parliamentarians have gone ahead with it , that does not invalidate the case for a referendum : it invalidates the case for representative democracy as it is .
I am not going to pronounce on the exact timeframe for coming to a final agreement .
On the basis of the positive experience on the other side of the Atlantic , the Commission is convinced that the Energy Star labelling programme will naturally lead to the gradual elimination of inefficient equipment on the Community market .
( DE ) Mr President , the aim of the proposal is to establish a new protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Partnership Agreement in the fisheries sector between the European Community and the Union of the Comoros .
The Committee on Development and Cooperation notes on this subject that nothing is being done to implement these new provisions .
Even a friendship that goes back many years is not immune to deep rifts .
We hope that all the Member States of the European Union will soon have the euro as legal tender .
This reform is also giving rise to terrible anxiety throughout the most remote regions .
It is no longer the case that youth players can play up in higher divisions , because their places are increasingly being filled by often cheaper players from outside the European Union or even from within it . This leads to bizarre situations , such the Belgian first division club SK Beveren usually fielding eleven Africans in Belgium ’ s top football league .
What is the precise thinking in this respect ?
If the answer is yes , the present debate would itself be a surprising event .
Mr President , I would like to return for a moment to the matter of seasonal workers in Italy .
I am able to inform you that these training schemes are already up and running in , among others , the Directorates @-@ General for development and employment and also in the Meda teams in the field of external affairs policy .
I would just like to point out that when we get to paragraph 31 , there is an oral amendment .
in writing . - The premature death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo , after seven years of illegal imprisonment against which he was left with only one means of protest , must be seen as the responsibility of the repressive Cuban regime .
Moreover , the proposal also allows us to identify and , if appropriate , adopt the Eurocontrol safety regulatory requirements concerning the training of controllers in order to transpose them into Community law .
I know that the Commissioner is very familiar with this matter .
It is important to remain level @-@ headed .
However , I would like to draw particular attention to the fact that in some countries corruption in the distribution of European Union funds is directly linked to the discrediting of policies conducted within these countries .
Developing alternative forms of energy depends first and foremost on research into the development of new technologies and now is our opportunity , now that the large companies which trade in oil are amassing a fortune in excessive profits made by taking advantage of rises in stock exchange prices , now that , as we have all realised , the framework programme for research and development is inadequate with the resources at its disposal ; this is our opportunity to promote the idea of imposing a clean energy tax on the oil industry , which can be used to finance the development of alternative forms of energy .
I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation on food distribution to the most deprived persons .
I would just like to make one small point : when he says that it would have been more correct to say that Heads of Government had been insulted , it is not that it would have been more correct , but that it was absolutely incorrect to say that Heads of State had been insulted .
We firstly had the MAI , and I believe that we managed , along with others , to avert the danger .
But if you try , sometimes you may find that you get what you need !
We must offer them a clear outlook and , therefore , I consider predictability to be a key issue .
( DE ) Madam President , Mr Le Hyaric , I see things in exactly the same way as you do .
It is true that there are many reasons why Belarus might want to attach itself to Russia , but it would be in its national interest to maintain a certain balance .
There is therefore no one solution and no one treatment .
This is something we have been talking about for decades , for as long as there has been a Club of Rome , so let us at last come up with something of some practical use .
Nowhere in the concerns that are evolving is there any mention of safety valves for the protection of consumers and the workers &apos; social rights .
We can see that the United States has mobilised a significant economic aid package and has developed a policy that is producing results .
Mr President , has the Commission considered the human health implications of poor implementation of animal welfare regulations ?
Before I came here , I swore I would tell no jokes .
How best to intervene at European level ?
It is also vital that we give clear answers to the citizens , who are worried about the possibility of nanoparticles being toxic to the environment , the food chain and the body .
Allow me to give an example .
The euro can easily be made the scapegoat for unemployment .
Naturally , we also welcome President @-@ elect Barack Obama &apos;s statement that he will take steps to close the detention centre quickly .
No one wishes to speak against .
We do not , however , consider it unfortunate that the Council chose not to propose a common European constituency for 10 % of the mandates to the European Parliament .
Together with Member States , we have taken a number of important steps to increase the availability of trade finance .
It is appropriate too that the draft resolution clearly identifies the need to link policies on vocational education and training with policies on employment , the economy , social integration , improving the competitiveness of higher education and enabling everyone to access it on equal terms .
In the light of this information , will the Commission initiate legal proceedings against the Irish Government for altering the boundaries of an SPA , and will it urge the Government to redesignate the entire SPA as it was first advertised in July 1999 ?
- Oomen @-@ Ruijten report
This new version has the advantage of being simpler and more up to date , and does not represent a step backwards in relation to the current situation .
Who intervened to stop this bloodletting ?
I wish to say quite clearly that Turkey &apos;s stance is provocative .
There is , however , inconsistency between what has been ascertained and the conclusions of the report , for the system flagrantly infringes the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union .
We are voting on a very important report , one that has a wide @-@ ranging impact on economic affairs and on the citizens of Europe .
We had hoped that the rhetoric of his speech in June would now be matched by some solid progress .
This agreement , which is particularly harsh on the poor , whom it considers to be undesirables , but reduces formalities required for businessmen , shows the true face behind the hypocritical mask - if we had not already seen it - of official speeches about Human Rights that this European Union claims it wishes to protect in Hong Kong or other countries .
Of course , Georgia &apos;s relationship with Russia is still an important factor , above all for psychological reasons .
Because the Americans are going to have problems implementing the liquidity standard , they are now attempting , once again , to introduce additional criteria alongside the external ratings .
A multitude of arguments have been made for and against having some form of guidance regarding the energy mix in the European Union .
Is the Council aware of the current inquiry into the murder of 24 Tamil civilians in the village of Kumarapuram in Trincomalee , Sri Lanka in February 1996 by military personnel ?
The success and effectiveness of the &apos; Youth on the Move &apos; initiative depends , to a large extent , on the attitude and key activities of Member States and the financial support they provide for the implementation of these programmes at a national level , which could contribute to the social integration of young people .
On the basis of that assessment , the Commission will take any further action deemed necessary .
However , civil society , NGOs , trade unions , business forums and think tanks will also have a very important role to play in implementing and monitoring the planned measures .
These are facts .
If you have nothing to hide , you also have nothing to be worried about .
We should provide assistance to Muslims in their own countries , and help bring about the rapid creation of a state of Palestine , as that nation has suffered greatly at the hands of Israel .
Such conduct is not indicative of good communication between the most important institutions of the European Union .
We have said what we would like to see regarding the Seventh Framework Programme .
The money is largely directed towards developing sustainable economic growth and creating jobs .
Likewise , you cannot solve unemployment simply by saying that we want more jobs .
I shall therefore concentrate on the part played by the Commission in this affair .
Beyond that , one of the main successes of the European Union is the internal market .
We intend to promote strategic dialogues – ranging from regulatory dialogue to cooperation in research – in sectors such as information technology , transport , energy , biotechnology or space science .
He campaigns for freedom of opinion and constitutional legality in Russia , and so , in contrast to those who are trying to silence him , he is a patriot .
You are , together with Mr Lamy , the negotiator for the Fifteen .
We accept that we are dealing here with a genuine budgetary emergency .
Only in this way will we be able to prevent similar accidents to the one that is now affecting the inhabitants of Kolontár and Devecser .
It is our view that there is no serious political content in the Friday sittings , which are used for matters which might just as well be dealt with on an administrative basis .
Such a proposal does not imply , as we wanted , full recognition status for Catalan , Basque and Galician .
That should be happening around about now , if it was going to .
I am convinced that the negotiations will impact greatly on many areas of policy .
After all , that is where they belong logically , and in terms of content .
Mr President , unlike the situation affecting other modes of transport , the liberalisation of the markets has only touched the surface of the rail transport sector .
We are concerned to uphold the protection of human , civil , political , economic and social rights and even , in line with EU policies , biodiversity and the protection of ecosystems .
Parliament &apos;s resolution calls for full respect for minority culture and languages - issues which lie at the very core of the European Free Alliance group .
Question No 49 by Maj Theorin ( H @-@ 0747 / 98 )
While we must recognise that the regulation is a little more appropriate , the directive , on the other hand , is a real disaster .
For the reasons that I have mentioned we shall vote against the report unless our amendments are accepted .
The second point is in relation to Fléchard .
Unfortunately , in this area , we lag at least a decade behind the United States , where the ever @-@ increasing quantities of shale gas being obtained have completely transformed the gas market .
Admittedly , it has to be said of Copenhagen that it was well organised , that excellent work was done , and that there was a marked improvement in transparency .
I would like to say that you give the impression of having been an MEP for many years given your mastery of the situation .
That is the underlying motive of the amendments which my group has tabled .
The questionnaire asks each Member State what measures it has adopted to combat terrorism , what the results have been in terms of the effectiveness of national laws and , in particular , what level of protection for fundamental human rights is afforded by national legislation .
The present system , in which it takes various signatures to authorise payments , does away with the notion of personal responsibility .
The Commission will be presenting proposals later this year in order that decisions can be taken before the directive lapses at the end of the year . And those proposals will provide a basis for wide @-@ ranging debate .
We must encourage the immediate inclusion of young people in the labour market and their ongoing training to promote professional growth .
The Commission &apos;s initiative has also been supported by the Heads of State and Government of the 27 Member States .
Just a few days ago , our Polish colleagues asked that we observe a minute ’ s silence to remember the massacre in Katyn , Miednoye and Jarkov , when 14 000 Polish officers were executed in cold blood by the Stalin regime on 5 March 1940 .
That is how matters actually stand , but we cannot have them remain like that .
I hope , Mr President , that the Luxembourg summit on 21 November will also give the European Union a social and human face .
After all , this issue is so important for so many black and poor people .
Almost EUR 300 million have been allocated to projects to assist the Roma population over the past five years .
All we are going to get now is a continuous monologue without any response from the other party .
I shall conclude by saying that the most significant of the four European freedoms is freedom of movement .
However , one can never repeat enough that illegal fishing is a crime against nature and against the economy , one that unfortunately often goes unpunished and against which we have to act with determination and courage .
They must stop hiding behind unfounded criticism of the European Union ; stop hiding behind patently unrealistic and tactical demands , and join in a real negotiation on all the issues .
We therefore condemn the EU &apos; s attempts to use human rights as a pretext in order to reinforce its anti @-@ grass roots and anti @-@ democratic nature and intervene further to the detriment of the people .
After all , it is a good story to tell .
It seems extraordinary that we continue to permit the export of implements from the European Union which are used for torture by agents within the states we allow them to be exported to .
If you would like an explanation about specific amounts , we will provide it in writing .
His Commission included a number of positive and strategic achievements .
Do not put your name to this mockery .
To my knowledge , no such restriction exists in any national parliament .
I fully subscribe to the statement in the report that &apos; the success of global governance , in the face of the challenges posed by growing globalisation and interdependence , can only be based on an effective and fair multilateral system unequivocally anchored in the United Nations &apos; .
Nonetheless , voices are being raised questioning the validity of the document .
Resumption of the sitting
Mr President , I have already answered some of the questions Mrs Breyer has raised again regarding the proposals put forward .
It is important , particularly for the many aid organisations , that such export is not prevented , and that simple channels are opened and simple decision making procedures put in place to promote such opportunities .
That is more than last year &apos;s 24 legislative proposals , 57 non @-@ legislative proposals and five negotiating mandates .
I just wanted to say that listening to Mr Tomczak proves exactly why we need a debate on homophobia in this House .
Allow me in conclusion to emphasise asylum and refugee policy within the European Union .
It is encouraging that the recommendations from the committee correspond fully to the measures proposed in the risk capital action plan , and the Commission would very much like to once again thank the rapporteur for his work .
Mr Davies said that collectively the first 17 plans notified propose a total allocation that exceeds 2005 emissions of these Member States by about 15 % , which is really a lot .
Like the other European institutions , the European Parliament therefore appears to be a prime example of contradiction and impotence .
The GUE / NGL Group , along with the other groups , thus calls on the Council and the Commission to withdraw these proposals .
In 2002 , despite positively diluvian rainfall and flooding , as much as 98.5 % of Europe ’ s coastal waters complied with the directive ’ s specifications .
It is also the intention that this agreement should , in harmony with the timetable for the development of the single area of freedom , security and justice , ensure that people can cross borders lawfully and without problems and stay legally in both areas .
To this end , lists of organisations wishing to take part in the process need to be drawn up , but , at the same time , institutions responsible for the preparation and promotion of such lists should be established .
I would be in favour of our attempting to begin a trialogue following Thursday ’ s vote , and then we may really be able to launch this programme on 1 January 2007 .
We do not wish to see a moratorium - which may be technically justified - but a ban based on fundamental ethical considerations .
This Committee of Inquiry solved many procedural issues and in essence interpreted the Inter @-@ institutional Agreement in the best possible way .
We hope that Moratinos , our representative , in conjunction with Mr Solana and the Swedish Presidency , succeed at least in bringing those parties around the negotiating table once more , for there is no other alternative .
We heard from Mr Barnier and Mr Grech today , and we made a contribution with Mr Monti &apos;s report .
Financial and technical support should also include the promotion of human and economic development as well as consultations in the event of the violation of human rights , democracy and fundamental freedoms .
I believe that Mr Tannock wished to speak .
For precisely this reason , this House must also vote in favour .
May I draw your attention to comments that he has made since the date that you mention and ask you to what extent the Presidency is committed to doing away with certain provisions of the Convention on Human Rights ?
Adopting legislative measures for positive discrimination that facilitate women ’ s access to political posts must always be considered very carefully , so as not to distort the genuine rules of democracy and of free choice and also not to offend and discriminate against women who , of their own free will and on their own merits , have risen to the highest positions without any artificial mechanisms to promote them .
The shortcomings must be remedied .
This , of course , begs the question : what is the best way ?
The examination will take place in March 1998 , based on the real results for 1997 .
Nonetheless , a sceptic would be bound to point out that the aforementioned glass remained half empty .
However , I believe that in so doing , one must respect the principle of subsidiarity and some of the typical national characteristics which I believe should be defended and protected .
Now , Madam President , due to the allusions , I would like to answer the second , much more unpleasant , question .
However , the question was : What contribution the President @-@ in @-@ Office thought that we in the EU and he could make with regard to this global transportation safety question ?
If we do not have it , the services will develop very differently from Member State to Member State .
The time for delays has passed : we must implement initiatives which ensure a uniform level of protection of citizens &apos; fundamental rights in criminal @-@ law proceedings and minimum rules for the admissibility of evidence , and the Convention on the Future of Europe must propose a suitable legal basis in the European Constitution which is sufficiently flexible to allow the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor to combat fraud , capable , in the future , of evolving within the context of Eurojust with wider objectives relating to the fight against cross @-@ border crime .
Europe &apos;s citizens are expecting action and concrete solutions to the problems and very specific needs which they have .
But it is wrong to see it simply in those terms , because there is more to it than that .
China does not need handouts , it has plenty of capital : it has the largest foreign currency reserves in the world .
The French organising committee is not a normal commercial profit @-@ seeking company .
We have proposed a number of amendments in a bid to harmonise and tighten up supervisory arrangements and sanctions .
- ( PL ) Madam President , we discussed the situation in Zimbabwe on 24 April 2008 .
This is not on .
If this timetable is not changed , we will quite consciously be embarking on a course leading to the kind of errors that the Court of Auditors and above all Parliament criticised with the last Framework Programme . I believe that we should not let history repeat itself .
The human rights organisation , Karapatan , has recorded 839 cases of summary executions since 2001 .
The change would not have any impact on the Community market in wine .
I am therefore most grateful to my colleague Georgios Papastamkos for being able to introduce numerous important themes into the committee debate , and I am most grateful that the ALDE Group has tabled various amendments for tomorrow &apos;s plenary that move in this direction .
As a result , I do not believe that there is any need for an interinstitutional agreement in this area .
To enable this to be done , it is imperative that we encourage research and development into marker vaccines which enable a vaccinated animal to be distinguished from an infected animal .
The Commission has begun - and this is crucial , because we are after all talking about 80 % shared responsibility here - quite clearly to state erroneous expenditure in the accounts of the European Union for 2009 .
I am please to note that on 12 October in London , Iceland will enter into negotiations with the coastal states , and I am hopeful that a satisfactory solution can be reached .
&lt; empty &gt;
It has become urgent , as others have said , to convene the Association Council provided for by the agreement between the Union and Tunisia and to impose on the latter a binding schedule in which respect for human rights must be the central issue to be settled .
I would like to thank him for his contribution to our common goal , which is a chemically safer Europe .
The partial acceptance of these amendments is due to a number of reasons .
Therefore , even at this very early stage of my relationship with the European Union , and at my very first encounter with Parliament in plenary sitting , it is legitimate that I should set out my vision of the European venture .
( The president cut the speaker off )
Does the EU have plans to compensate those countries for losses of conservation revenues from an ongoing ban on the sale of elephant products ?
That is why we need to ensure that we lend sufficient support to that region .
I am well aware that this is not a lot of money ; in fact , it represents an absolute minimum .
Our energy provision will continue to rely on oil and nuclear power but , as we prepare for the World Climate Change conference in Copenhagen , the only big idea is the switch to renewables .
I would like to mention that the amendments adopted within the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety form part of an agreement with the Commission and the Council as they feature in the final draft due to be voted on in plenary tomorrow .
Mr Smith mentioned that the law must also be straightforward and applicable , particularly in regard to environmental legislation .
Finally , Mr President , I should like to touch briefly on a matter that a number of Members of the House have raised this evening , which is the matter of a possible link between social policies and competition policies .
Several people have recently expressed their concern about the Hungarian Prime Minister , Mr Ferenc Gyurcsány , promising that more than one billion Chinese citizens can travel to Hungary without a visa .
I welcome these positive steps and , if the European Union copyright legislation is to be adapted , there must be an increased engagement with stakeholders so that the change reflects their interests while , at the same time , facilitating a knowledge @-@ based economy .
We should make sure that we only use that money for things that cannot be funded through the regular systems already in place .
In 1996 , a human rights dialogue between the European Union and China was established and , within this framework , we are maintaining a frank debate on these matters .
I want to confirm that I voted for it , like many of us , not only because this will enable us in future centuries to have a less polluted atmosphere that is less damaging to our health , but also because I believe that , if everybody knows that we in Europe breathe healthier , cleaner , less polluted air , we shall have more tourists in Europe who , as well as coming to see the beauty of history and nature that we have throughout Europe - in Scotland , for instance , where you come from , or in Genoa and Liguria , where I come from - if there is cleaner air as well , will come in even greater numbers !
If the public authorities were to promote the mechanism described in the report , this would lead to trade union and social demands for its introduction across all sectors and businesses .
Therefore Europe &apos;s policy response must be comprehensive , consistent and determined .
In the Council &apos;s conclusions regarding the Middle East , both parties are called to account on their obligations .
2006 discharge : EU general budget , section I - European Parliament (
- A6 @-@ 0095 / 2006 by Umberto Guidoni , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on the discharge for the implementation of the budget of the European Agency for Reconstruction for the financial year 2004 &#91; 2005 / 2108 ( DEC ) &#93; ;
It is also crucial that we liberalise the telecommunications and energy markets , and not all countries are doing so in the same way .
Ukraine still bears heavy scars .
I also thank the Commissioner for a particularly sound staff working paper for Accra .
We therefore call on the Commission , as a matter of urgency , to find a way of redressing the current historical imbalances in the allocation of rural development funding .
Therefore , my vote is globally in favour of the proposals in this report .
How do people think it will be received in Palestine and in other countries if at precisely this time we reach an agreement with Israel as the first country , while on the other hand human rights are being brutally trampled under foot , not only by Israel .
So recital F and paragraph 12 should be corrected to show that we are criticising &apos; models &apos; and not &apos; the model &apos; and as a consequence the reference to the United States should be removed .
I now regret that this opportunity has not been grasped to abolish the fund or to stipulate that Members wishing to belong to it must finance it entirely from their own pockets .
We are even getting one of them thrown in for free , without knowing what long @-@ standing liabilities it conceals .
I therefore hope that we will denounce this situation with a very broad majority and that both the EU and Southern Africa will finally call for an end to these conditions .
Everyone would agree , even the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets , who by the way gave the same report on two different subjects , which surely shows that there were certain difficulties during compilation .
We were already able to gauge his interest in a more efficient EU .
Madam President , I am sorry that I must rise .
Mr Manisco , I do understand that some Members are finding that this matter is dragging on .
Mr President , I wish to begin with a point of order .
That proves that it was at least possible to perfect the Barcelona Process and we will all focus our efforts in that direction .
The European Union is rightly extending export opportunities for Russian companies in EU markets to boost the Russian economy .
From my point of view , I can only assure you that I come from a very small country , and multilingualism and linguistic problems are very serious for small nations .
Once they have signed a joint communiqué , each country cannot then pursue its own approach and there can be no repetition of the farce witnessed in the Security Council .
I believe strongly that this report should be given Parliament &apos; s wholehearted support and a message should be sent to both the Commission and the Council that we are determined that these essential measures should not be diluted or weakened in any way .
In accordance with the undertakings made in the letters from my fellow Commissioners , Mrs Schreyer , Mr Liikanen and myself last October , the Commission plans to continue to inform Parliament on a regular basis regarding the implementation of the Fifth Framework Programme and of its budget , as it has already done on several occasions , in October and December 1999 and then in January and April 2000 .
rapporteur . - Mr President , a few points first .
Allow me to make a few comments on the proposed amendments and then , thanks to the speaking time for my group , I shall still have time for a comment at the end of the debate .
For this reason I welcomed and voted in favour of this measure .
Mr President , I will focus on the single area of environmental issues .
Mr President , I am grateful for everything that has been said on the subject of Ukraine .
I cannot imagine that it has received much praise over the last six months , but here it is deserved .
Gaddafi uses 30 million Africans who want to come to Europe as a bargaining chip .
I think it would be a good thing if we had a free vote across this House on issues of this kind .
We therefore voted in favour of these proposals .
Last year in Lisbon , the European Union , as Mr Bullmann has pointed out , set itself a goal which meant achieving over the next decade the most competitive and dynamic knowledge @-@ based economy in the world , allowing us to achieve sustainable economic growth with the creation of more jobs and greater social cohesion .
In order to make our territories safer , all useful means must be implemented .
Thirdly , competition must not be encouraged , or be the outcome of this directive , between national health services ; nor indeed should competition generally be encouraged in this area .
Just as Joseph Daul pointed out , I believe it is a matter of innovation and training ; in other words , the things that basically drive enterprise and make people employable .
Following the Orange Revolution , a renewed willingness on the Ukrainian side to boost EU @-@ Ukraine cooperation could be observed .
This project cannot just be based on the production of documents , on declarations of good intentions or on the establishment of trade relations : it must provide forces equal to the task of combating terrorism in order to protect our values , our vision of the world and our institutions of freedom .
Price fixing , restrictions on , or control of , production , dividing up markets , application of different prerequisites for the same services and the extra provisions of the Treaties , which often vary tremendously in Europe and exclude different services , are incompatible with the laws , even in the areas where exemption regulations apply .
in writing . - ( DE ) The visa liberalisation in 2009 demonstrated to all intents and purposes that many people in the Balkans equate visa @-@ free travel with being given carte blanche .
As long as we have these huge differences in tax and social security and we still get up to all kinds of tricks when it comes to recognising diplomas and certificates , a great many job opportunities will be lost in border areas , both now and in the future .
By remembering the grim past that the European Union has grown from it can help guide us in the most appropriate direction for the future .
Fight the fire in the winter and not in the summer , when it is already raging .
With this European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control we are establishing a Europe of immune defence .
This is the third time in around six months that this Parliament is discussing the resolution on human rights in Tunisia .
It recalls its political will to see to it that Parliament benefits from identical treatment .
There are practical arguments supporting multilingualism : it reduces the risk of unemployment , increases the chances of finding employment , helps increase the quality of the services provided and labour productivity , and facilitates mobility .
As far as Mr van Buitenen is concerned , he took up employment on 1 April in the Directorate @-@ General for Health and Consumer Protection in Luxembourg in a very responsible job , as the House would expect .
The average EU wage is EUR 368 a week , but some of our colleagues - 60 to 70 of our colleagues - continually sign in on a Friday here in Strasbourg , when there is no business , to claim EUR 304 .
For the first time in years , we see movement towards a permanent settlement and an independent , sovereign , viable Palestinian state .
For that reason alone , this regulation is deserving of support .
Is this surprising ?
I would like to raise one last point concerning the European Parliament &apos;s intention to create eight new budget lines without any appropriations in relation to , on the one hand , expenditure in connection with implementing the Treaty of Lisbon and , on the other , revenue in connection with its own resources .
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
Firstly , only an active strategy of supporting business , reducing red tape and a radical increase in infrastructure investments , abandoning the costly policy of farming subsidies and re @-@ allocating the money to research and development and regional development can solve the dilemma of funding pensions .
But I agree absolutely : there is more that we should be doing on that .
We must consider all the implications of this .
( FR ) Mr President , the cooperation and consultations of experts put in place by the European Commission really must be irreproachable from the point of view of transparency , because this is a dangerous exercise .
Let us therefore work together , here in the European Parliament , to fight against the trauma of breast cancer , and do so for everyone , not just those who can afford it .
The Commission ’ s two @-@ pronged approach to promoting gender equality abroad is also well reflected in the report .
I am convinced that peace movements against nuclear weapons , which achieved so much in the seventies and eighties , could take up their activities again in cooperation with us and our Parliament , so that we can truly live in a nuclear @-@ free world .
Concluding the Doha Round remains a problem , and the Seventh Ministerial Conference held in Geneva at the beginning of December did not create the conditions by which to strengthen the multilateral framework of international trade .
In such conditions , even the very expression &apos; elections &apos; does not correspond to reality .
The global data networks are particularly difficult to control .
As I said yesterday , Mrs Auroi &apos; s report points in the right direction although , of course , the context is such that the proposals cannot measure up to our vegetable protein needs .
The careful completion of this work is extremely important as only in that way can we ensure that Community resources and activities are being used appropriately .
Firstly , the action plan will be designed in accordance with the key principles of the European Union forestry strategy .
Protection against fraud , the free movement of drivers and road safety are key factors in the defence of freedom of movement in the EU .
The only way in which this cooperation can be successful is for the EU to speak with a single voice and commit to a dialogue which is subject to conditions , but at the same time constructive , based on common values , respect for human rights , fundamental freedoms and current international norms .
This is something to which the eCall system can contribute .
Furthermore , acquiring full membership constitutes an important step towards deeper European integration , by placing the EU in a new international role in the field of judicial collaboration in civil matters .
The new CAP will have to face new and urgent challenges , and should provide a framework for the future based on stability , predictability and flexibility in a time of crisis .
It is with disquiet that we note that the European Parliament now calls for the recognition of non @-@ trade concerns as import criteria in the WTO context .
We should already know how sure we can be of what influences climate change when we make political decisions .
The declarations on the environment are accompanied by abolition of the environmental guarantee contained in Article 100a ( 4 ) of the Treaty in favour of a dispensation procedure administered by the Commission .
We shall support the new Member States and I hope , personally speaking , that the Agenda , in 2007 , will enable them to benefit , like all the other Member States , from every aspect of the cohesion policy .
Mr Wolf has done an excellent job .
Demographic challenge and solidarity between generations (
In doing so , they are excluding themselves from the community of values that is the EU .
report ( A5 @-@ 0145 / 2002 ) by Mr Marinos , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the annual assessment of implementation of stability and convergence programmes ( Article 99 ( 4 ) EC ) ( 2002 / 2016 ( INI ) ) .
Apart from the Kurdish question , there is the question of other minorities too .
Mr President , we should not allow the Community patent to pass as a wasted opportunity .
Therefore , the most important thing is to have enough courage to grab the bull by its horns .
That is to say , the Commission is using Europeans &apos; money to manipulate Europeans .
The debate is closed .
However , this report raises two series of problems .
The relevant standard is sufficiently detailed and was re @-@ examined in depth in 2009 , with extended debates within the Council and the European Parliament .
Mr President , I thank the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , although I should like express my disappointment that we are unable to ensure that the quite important and strict criteria of this code of conduct are respected .
I call upon the Egyptian President and the Egyptian Government to do the right , just and proper thing and to release the men in question .

In addition to the bilateral summits with the Republic of Korea and China , President Barroso had meetings with the President of Indonesia and the Prime Minister of Singapore , and Commissioner Ferrero @-@ Waldner met the Foreign Ministers of Vietnam , Thailand , Indonesia and the Philippines .
Secondly , we would like to see an assessment of the effects of new technologies , like electromagnetic radiation for example , on populations , on health and so on .
Some Member States ( for example , Germany and Austria ) operate a balanced forestry policy .
Although you cannot always believe what you read in the press , according to a press release you had asked the US trade representative , Susan Schwab , what she would be able to offer if the EU were to give the US everything it wanted on market access .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Collins , for his eminent work on the directive on drinking water .
Let us then now draw the right and necessary conclusions for 2006 , or else reports of that sort will in fact be nothing more than wastepaper .
It is criminal and it is unjustifiable under any circumstances .
Beyond that , I wish to refer to some points in the report that Mrs McCarthy and I prepared , which I regard as particularly important .
The Committee on Development and Cooperation received a visit from a delegation representing the fishermen themselves , and it was they who asked us to vote against the trade agreement , because they are concerned at the fact that access has been given to their fishery within the twelve @-@ mile zone .
He is , for Europe , one of our unsung heroes .
In the private sector this is more prevalent and the rate rises to 25 % .
They were furious about the ban .
At this stage , it is extremely important to make the Frameworks available in as many of the official languages as possible , to enable political and legal groups and other interested parties to have a thorough discussion on the subject of the future of European contract law .
For this reason , we are urging our Turkish counterparts to make changes in these very areas , in order to establish some degree of legal certainty and to avoid a situation in which certain agitation or certain trends in Turkish politics lead to changes in people &apos;s legal certainty .
No good legislation ever comes about without revision , and we will only be able to achieve the binding values that Parliament has proposed for 2005 if we keep a constant eye on how everything is being implemented .
The basic concept for the fathers of European integration was freedom of thought and opinion .
No one can say at present when exports of gelatine will in fact be resumed .
Like a number of other delegations , France has stated clearly that it does want the scope of application to be extended to national policies .
As the rapporteur for agricultural reform , I would like to offer you the opportunity to work together with us to find a solution , so that this goal can be achieved .
That emphatically is not the Commission &apos;s intention .
I think the House has been enlightened by the positions expressed by Mr Schulz and Mrs Ek .
While we feel that lobbyists may bring considerable information to us parliamentarians , it is also our duty to ensure the maximum amount of transparency in the decision @-@ making process and in the way in which lobbies attempt to affect our decisions .
According to the report that has been tabled , some progress has been made , but there is still a long way to go , particularly with regard to the fisheries sector .
Mr President , on 27 June 2003 the Commission published a new proposal aimed at guaranteeing the sustainable recovery of the Northern hake stock and its reduction within what is considered the safe biological limit , a precautionary level of biomass which is set at 165 000 tonnes .
I also want to comment on some of the background , and remind you that almost half of the 400 , 000 Rwandan refugees in Zaire who did not return to their own country were located and helped a few weeks ago at Tingi Tingi .
The &apos; food miles &apos; labels currently used by some UK supermarkets are unsatisfactory and can give misleading information .
There will be no common foreign policy until the Member States &apos; governments feel the need for one .
Following on from what one might term a period of weakness and a Commission position more strongly influenced by the Council , she has come back to making a positive and essential contribution to the final outcome that gives us hope for the future .
Last week I had a very productive private meeting with Ambassador Moratinos to seek his advice as to how best to move some of these ideas forward .
Rather the other way around !
I am now considering initiatives in this area that could be taken in the near future .
I have time only to refer to abuses of religious freedom .
The first of these was in relation to animal experiments .
Another option mentioned in the joint resolution which deserves a more comprehensive evaluation is the creation of a Euromed production zone of the clothing and apparel industry .
For those in the audio @-@ visual sector , this is a situation which has worsened , not improved .
I hope that even those accidents which have been avoided , to say nothing about the tragic reality of the actual aircraft accidents , will convince the Council , so that this document does not end up in a drawer somewhere but is instead dealt with effectively and also fulfils its objective .
What is your view on this approach ?
I was one of the people who were in favour of an own @-@ initiative report being produced before the Commission makes its proposals on the framework for transposing the Basel Agreement , and I am delighted that the work done by Mr Karas with the help of the various shadow rapporteurs has highlighted the main points for consideration .
in writing . ( LT ) I voted for the report on financial control of EU budget funds allocated to Afghanistan and European Parliament resolutions on this matter prepared by my colleague , Véronique Mathieu .
Firstly , the strategy must be comprehensive .
This is a major revolution , and our actions should be equal to these events .
Many of the amendments which Parliament has submitted show that reconciliation will be necessary .
We therefore do not agree with many aspects of this report , particularly where , as supporters of the sovereignty of individual Member States , we hear requests , even on such a sensitive issue , for a qualified majority vote and even for it to be brought in early before the Constitution enters into force .
We are eagerly exploring all these options .
Then , the proposal met with the strongest possible resistance from the other Community institution .
This requires a strong , knowledge @-@ based and properly regulated internal market , using the experience we have gained and the lessons we have learned .
I am pleased that the directive emphasises the fact that the victims shall be protected from any form of prosecution or punishment .
Mr Swoboda referred to this a moment ago : a vigorous railway sector within an internal market , which can be effective for the entire Union .
I should also like to thank the Council and the Commission for supporting us in the end on the reintroduction of the 12 @-@ day rule for buses and coaches .
We must do a lot more .
The German Presidency strongly asks you to bear this in mind when the time comes for you to vote .
This problem could be solved if the Member States were to set up an ad hoc fund for the direct financing of the planning , purchase , construction and management of wells and water systems .
The rules across the EU need to be harmonised , so that we do not face unpleasant surprises and extra costs .
That is very much to be regretted and , from my group &apos;s point of view , no matter where in this House a Member who cheats in this way sits - whether it be on the left or on the right - in future my group will be asking for immediate exclusion of that Member at the time that the incident occurs .
In the very short time we have available , we want to make two comments , also very short .
I speak , not just as a Member of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , which is interested in information , but also as a Member of the Committee on Petitions .
I would notably point to : the switch from the ‘ pull ’ to the ‘ push ’ system , which is long overdue ; information to passengers , which is key but which is apparently still not happening ; and purpose limitation – which is a more difficult issue , but an absolutely crucial one .
London is diverse in culture and thriving in its creativity and , as the cultural industries represent a significant sector of London &apos;s economy , I very much welcome the recommendations to support their sustainability and growth .
– Mr President , Mr Sifunakis ’ report is highly significant , as it draws attention to the need to deal with the basis of national culture , that is with traditional culture that still lives on , particularly in rural and island communities .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( ES ) Madam President , I would ask the European right to stop meddling in Venezuela .
The traffickers in human beings and the document forgers will thank those of you who support this proposal , and you can rest assured that the general public &apos; s response will be one of indignation .
On the nuclear power plant and the questions about security and safety , let me tell you that , in our technical dialogue on energy with Belarus , we pay special attention also to ensuring that this country respects international safety and security standards .
Mr President , this surprises me a little as we have been told that it will no longer be allowed for Sweden to carry out spot checks of the kind carried out before we acceded to the European Union . This question is therefore extremely important .
What a pity that the British Presidency could not be bothered to turn up this morning to listen to you !
I would , however , add further elements to this year ’ s timetable .
At the moment we have EUR 9 million for the first year and EUR 6 million for the two following years in line B7 @-@ 6002 , without prejudice to the fact that resources from geographical lines can benefit decentralised cooperation actions .
I must thank him for his frankness , because in a way the two concepts are contradictory .
In addition , we need to examine how well minorities are protected and binding sanctions need to be officially laid down .
This report on the Commission &apos;s communication on the participation of European Economic Interest Groupings in public contracts and programmes financed by public funds addresses exactly that issue .
It is not possible for one part of a people to be free while the other part lives under an oppressive system , as was the case for us in Germany .
One @-@ minute speeches ( Rule 150 )
Luxembourg has the responsibility of chairing the Council during this crucial period .
All right , so we will vote on the Oomen @-@ Ruijten question first and then on Mr Kouchner .
The Treaty of Nice only required the Union to show itself a coherent force in the world .
Anyone seeking to freeze the budget will damage Europe and weaken our ability to fulfil our duties to our citizens .
This means it is important for there to be a link with the European Ombudsman , a symbiosis , that helps to create this guaranteed area of safety for citizens .
It would not be a question of setting targets with a view to obligatory harmonisation .
All this confirms our demand for democracy on two fronts , on the one hand for a major pluralist debate in each country on what is at stake in the treaties , and on the other for ratification by referendum .
With the greatest of respect , it would be arrogant on our part not to do so .
It is the large multinational pharmaceuticals industry that has decided , in the German case , that this plastic gadget and the medicine belong together .
These developments undoubtedly breach Article 6 of the NPT Treaty .
Although we define targets , they are not binding .
It is there in the East and in the West , even though the acts are perpetrated by a minority .
I think Mr Skinner made a very interesting suggestion when he said &apos; make the directors pay &apos; .
Wages are not a competence of the EU , nor should they be .
It has the responsibility , first of all , to ensure a stable , European , peaceful and better future for its neighbour , Bosnia and Herzegovina , and secondly , to strike an historic compromise with the neighbouring Albanian nation .
I want to follow the theme that he raised on safety , particularly with relation to health and consumer policies .
The agency was still in its infancy and work was gathering pace , with high expectations of it on the part of the public and politicians , something that can lead to disappointing results .
It has adapted to a substantial extension of the scope of the tasks entrusted to the Community , and now to the EU .
Large @-@ scale patient mobility should be unnecessary if a Member State discharges its responsibilities with a well @-@ run , efficient health service .
Parliament will propose increasing the budget item to combat fraud in the agricultural sector .
That , in essence , is the message which the Committee on Development wishes to see this House and the Commission - I turn here to Commissioner Nielson - take away with them , because in a few weeks &apos; time , there is a key date : the meeting in Bali , the last preparatory meeting before the Johannesburg Summit .
Because ratification by the parliaments is as legitimate and democratic as ratification by referendum .
The Court of Auditors informed the European Parliament that the Foundation &apos;s annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular .
Consequently the question arises as to whether there will be a territorial policy or not .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I too wish to start by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Szymański , for a very good report .
It is a sophisticated piece of legislation - the best in the world , as I have said - to enable consumers to make the choice for themselves of whether or not to consume GM foods .
Training measures designed for these people are therefore necessary and even essential . As Mr Lisi said , however , they should not be limited to workers in potentially hazardous factories ; they should be extended to sub @-@ contracted employees .
Prevention education should begin early in the primary school curriculum in these countries .
We are dealing with the question of how to provide ourselves , in the future , with the resources for devising a global economic policy which takes full account of the interdependence of the European economies , not simply as the sum of national situations , because in a European economy , one plus one does not equal two .
The scrapping of internal border controls between Member States , enabling genuine freedom of movement within the Union should under no circumstances mean enabling freedom of movement for all manner of criminality , illegal migration , and so forth .
Adopt it , fight for it and , along with all the European institutions , fight for those farmers whom you already defend so fiercely .
I believe that we should have further serious discussions about this .
Madam President , Commissioner , I will simply make a few general comments on Agenda 2000 . I should like to acknowledge the work done by Parliament &apos;s various rapporteurs .
I wish to point out to you that the convening of a meeting like this one is at the discretion of the President , but subject to consultation with the Conference of Presidents .
The population of the Ukraine is so impoverished that it lacks the purchasing power to be able to buy any substantial amount of electricity as a consumer .
That means developing a budgetary policy which speeds up the allocation of Community support funds and transfers them more quickly and easily to the Member States ...
If Mugabe does not take immediate and verifiable action in the way that the international community is demanding , the European Union must be ready at once to impose the smart sanctions .
The EU continues to support their active participation in all the work of the Human Rights Council .
Mr President , yesterday , when the flags of the new Member States of the European Union were raised here in Strasbourg , Poland was celebrating the anniversary of the adoption of the first written constitution in Europe , and the second in the world , namely the 1791 Polish constitution .
One of our difficulties is always going to be of course that the better we are at reform , the less anybody is going to know about it so we will be relying on our friends and partners in the European Parliament to explain with their customary generosity the full efforts being made by the Commission to properly serve the people of Europe .
When UKIP vote on this report , it will vote in accordance with the wishes of UK citizens .
The Council would point out that these European Council conclusions formed a contribution to the European Commission &apos;s Third Energy Package , presented in September 2007 , which has the goal of subsequently opening up the internal market for gas and electricity .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
People want us to be clearer about the objectives , that is to say more jobs , a proper state of affairs in the labour market , social responsibility , international solidarity , the fight against crime , sustainable development and gender equality .
Moreover , on the development of so @-@ called high speed freight freeways .
Each institution must fulfil their respective obligations and urge Member States to gather reliable information by working clearly and effectively together . What is more , they need to draw up specific action plans to tackle a problem that particularly affects the youth in our countries and implement them more rigorously and with greater enthusiasm .
It welcomes the trade agreement with Colombia , despite the fact that hundreds of trade unionists have been killed in recent years , guilty simply of being trade unionists .
The way the system is administratively organised in the case of the European Development Fund is that we call in money on a quarterly basis from the treasuries of the Member States on an ongoing basis .
Please answer that question .
So it is as you please : either now or at 9 p.m.
The four common spaces form an essential part of our strategic relationship ; they show that we want to be more than just close neighbours .
SEPA data are not covered by the agreement ; most transfers are not affected at all .
The student exchange initiated by the EU is now highly developed and has become a shining example of supranational and extraordinarily effective cooperation .
Bearing in mind that we are talking about a war which violated international law and did not enjoy the multilateral support of the United Nations , I would ask you - and please reply , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council - do you condemn the violation of the right to life which has been suffered by the victims of this illegal war ?
This means that we see the issue of interoperability , like that of obligations to transmit , as being essential .
The common position forms a balanced text which we should not tinker with too much .
In the field of justice and home affairs alone , we are now being proposed a sixth programme , Hippocrates .
Thank you , Commissioner .
I knew it was useless .
I am now hoping that Mr Lajčák will succeed where others have failed : that is , in bringing both parties to the table and achieving a breakthrough .
We must get away from the piecemeal approach .
In the meantime another petition has been started which also concerns the transport of animals and since then more than half a million signatures have been collected .
Such a structure would also allow us to assist the very poorest and most vulnerable countries , which are often the hardest hit by climate change .
In 2009 alone , the Commission provided a total of EUR 950 million to approximately 115 million people in more than 70 countries .
We therefore hope that the OSCE mission can go about their normal business and urge the Belarusian Government to lend them a hand .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m.
The Council remains seriously concerned about the human rights situation in Cuba , in particular , the lack of progress for civil and political rights .
. ( NL ) There was a time when the preparation and implementation of government policy was kept secret as far as possible , as the ordinary man in the street did not need to know how and with what arguments they were governed .
The latter nevertheless stood firm and adopted an appropriate stance .
It allocates to the European Investment Bank the role of an &apos; environmentally @-@ friendly &apos; supervisor which will act &apos; in accordance with advice from the OECD and G8 &apos; , and demands that future proposals should be those dictated by the WTO .
In this respect , I think that it would be advisable to include a chapter devoted to small enterprises , with an emphasis on fair competition .
I wonder if the fact that you did not have enough resources at your disposal has anything to do with the report that was published yesterday by the Court of Auditors , which says that a lot of work is being impeded by people being on short @-@ term contracts .
But we must also protect it against drugs , including the drugs some people dare describe as &apos; soft &apos; .
Nor do I understand , however , the amendment instigated mainly by German Members , which takes no account of the position of the smaller countries and requests that more opportunities be given to the larger Member States in the Council .
( RO ) I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur for her efforts to create a legal framework which will provide the basis for implementing the biometric identification system .
The debate is closed .
The adoption by the Commission of a possible proposal for such a directive is subject to the results of the impact assessment which will be carried out in 2006 .
Overall , it is to be welcomed that the Committee on the Environment did not accept the doubtless well @-@ intentioned proposals from the rapporteur , on the grounds I referred to above .
Perhaps it would also be appropriate to be able to allocate money from other European Union financial mechanisms , earmarked for overall energy efficiency .
What Europe in fact needs is not even more deregulation , liberalisation and privatisation , but the very opposite ; what we need is a radically different economic policy in which , for once , the interests of workers and consumers are treated as more important than big business &apos;s interest in private profit .
With regard to today &apos;s report , I thank and congratulate the rapporteur for the content of his report .
Mr President , the Interreg , URBAN and Leader initiatives are breeding grounds for social and economic innovation which we must preserve at all costs .
This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the budgetary situation of the European Court of Justice ( ECJ ) .
The current rate of trafficking in children is now ten times higher than that of the transatlantic slave trade at its peak .
The views of the European Parliament will form the basis for future work at EU level aimed at implementing a more sustainable pricing policy .
This is duly reflected in the resolution that will be put to a vote tomorrow .
The task now before us is to amend the money laundering regulations for the third time .
One of its prerequisites , however , is to appoint competent authorities who can provide a strict control of nuclear waste management activities and can penalise violations in an appropriate manner , if necessary .
You are familiar with the behaviour of the Members of Parliament .
A successful summit needed two things : political will on the part of the major countries , and skilful diplomatic leadership .
. Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in my language , the word ‘ ’ covers the meaning of the two English words ‘ safety ’ and ‘ security ’ .
This abuse of the right to asylum , contrary to the Geneva Convention , is not mentioned at any point in the report , and with good reason : it is convenient to make the &apos; white man &apos; feel guilty by reminding him that he was a terrible colonialist and that he now needs to pay for that in every sense of the word .
For a start , the impact of the use of biometric data in such a large system has not been assessed , and nor have the conditions for the inclusion of such data been adequately laid down .
If the European Union contributes more than 40 % to rebuilding Iraq , for example , I would have liked us to have more than 40 % of the participation rights and codecision rights .
We are aware that the Maastricht Treaty establishes that the ECB is to be independent in terms of personnel , organization , operation and finance , as well as politically .
- limit advertising of medicinal products ;
The European ambition should be rewarded .
The other States , too , are starting to articulate their claims more strongly .
The debate is closed .
In the resolution which has been adopted , the European Parliament has clearly declared its support for greater transparency in the European Commission &apos;s negotiations on the Anti @-@ Counterfeiting Trade Agreement .
Like Parliament , we would have preferred to see the Charter apply to all 27 Member States , with no exceptions to its full justiciability , but we should not underestimate the results achieved .
Truly it is time to launch a non @-@ discriminatory trade system with South Africa and to settle any unresolved questions without further delay , so that the negotiations on the free trade agreement can be concluded favourably at the Council meeting , without any smallminded restrictions .
In view of the time , I will not go into the third and last matter now . I thought it would be raised in the debate , but I do hope we will have a chance to address it at a later date , since you have included it in your report .
She did a very good job in the first round , receiving very broad support in the Committee on Development and in our Group too , of course .
On the one hand , however , the resolution voted for by a majority of the European Parliament states that &quot; the dignity of the peoples of the candidate countries must never be wounded by insensitive demands from the EU &quot; and the need to correct certain discriminatory aspects that were approved in Nice is acknowledged .
In our opinion , we are offered an amendment to Article 7 which called for levels of compensation to be based on specific impact assessments , so that it could not be argued that they were frivolously levied .
Regarding the specific question you have just raised , the Council is obviously open to studying and considering all proposals and the Commission naturally has an important role to play in this matter .
Flags of convenience in our shipping industry have haunted us for years and we have never achieved a solution .
Unfortunately , in some Member States there is honey on the market which is up to 80 % adulterated .
At that time , it was finally agreed that wine would be zero rated .
For the rest , there is no reason why sensible standards of safety should not be adopted voluntarily by democratic nation states with independent judiciaries and free public access to judicial systems .
The Commission welcomes , and therefore accepts , Amendments Nos 1 and 3 because it shares Parliament &apos;s wish to strive for greater security in terms of monitoring precursors and drugs .
Please , Mr President , could you chair this debate and ask the members to be quiet ? As I was trying to say , this is part of the Amsterdam agreements and those agreements have yet to be ratified !
The problem is that this combination of factors differs from country to country and must take into account peculiarities of the national economy .
Do you really believe that meeting this commitment should be at the expense of other types of aid to third countries ?
The EU must guarantee that rating agencies operate according to clear regulations .
I firmly believe that the most important objective is to distribute assistance fairly among the Member States and the different categories of farmers .
As a beekeeper , I have personally met in Puławy with beekeepers who had travelled from all over Poland .
Mr President , we are dealing with a very significant case in which this Parliament is gambling some of its credibility , some of its prestige and some of its reputation as an institution .
The majority of the documents relating to the evaluation of medicinal products should be publicly accessible , but what about pharmacovigilance reports ?
Religion , the Catholic Church and other religious organisations play an enormous role in weaving the social fabric and preventing social exclusion .
The initial fear of a separation between the ins and pre @-@ ins is being overtaken by the logic of the screening process and the EU &apos;s pre @-@ accession strategy .
This has already had a considerable impact in Germany .
I would just remind you of the Save programme .
After all , it is not our freedom , economic development , modernity or the mere existence of Western culture that feeds terrorism ; it is radicalism .
This is happening despite all the promises made as a result of official letters , parliamentary visits and ad hoc missions .
Issues such as climate change , energy security , training and cooperation in educational matters are essential for economic and social development in the ACP countries .
Furthermore , the Commission should evaluate the results of the first macro @-@ regional strategies implemented .
Subject : Violation of basic democratic freedoms and human rights in Genoa The unanimous Council decisions on taking repressive measures ahead of the Genoa Summit provided the political backing the Italian government needed for the events that took place there .
I attended a huge &apos; Soul for Europe &apos; forum in Berlin a few days ago , which was also attended by representatives of all the cultural agencies .
There was not one vote , however .
The appeal from Member States , which reflects that from European citizens , is for every opportunity to be found for prudence and greater efficiency when spending public resources .
May I also clarify that the head of Europol is now a British man of great quality .
The areas of concern I have about the amendments and some of the proposals put forward relate firstly to tax harmonisation , which I oppose totally , and secondly to increased regulatory supervision over the operation of these funds , because we already have a raft of legislation governing investment vehicles and investment instruments .
The harsh reality experienced by women in the EU ( high unemployment rate , few , poorly paid , scarce jobs , terrorism in the workplace , lack of measures giving social support to the family , increase in the retirement age , wage discrimination and so on ) is the outcome of the strategic choices of the ΕU , to which the Lisbon and Barcelona Summits gave significant momentum .
We have showed such interest in Chile that during the time of the dictatorship and over the following years we have been able to have a budget heading devoted exclusively to Chile &apos;s transition to democracy .
We do , though , have another clock that works but which is located behind you .
We also regard the greatest challenge which now faces the EU is in fulfilling the requirements which have been imposed .
Even before the Central and Eastern European states accede to the EU , they need to set up working systems alongside our own to oversee the safety of food and feedingstuffs .
I think it is just as Mrs RiisJørgensen said : we must ensure that the regulations pertaining to public procurement on the part of the Union enable us to defer to the demands of the environment .
Food security is another priority in the new common agricultural policy .
I also think that in connection with the impact assessment question and other topics that you have raised here , such as screening , there are outstanding problems that may seem innocent enough but unfortunately are not : just look at the demolition job that you – you yourself and the Commissioner and President Barroso – are performing on REACH and have already performed on the pollution strategy .
We would like the Intergovernmental Conference to adopt our ideas and proposals .
I would also add that it would be very unhelpful , as Mr Aldonas at the Department of Commerce in the United States has suggested , for the US to link this steel dispute to the wider issue of problems in the global economy .
On the contrary , we need to ensure circulation of knowledge and of the people involved , particularly when it comes to research , innovation and development .
Mr President , the EU ’ s shambolic liberalisation of the energy market has already resulted in gross distortions .
I have been concerned for a long time that the initiative has become bureaucratic and safe and that the European Parliament , as the only democratically elected institution , should once again play a greater role .
Tackle on @-@ line security issues by reinforcing the dependability and reliability of networks used by enterprises .
However , there is no longer even any discussion of the fact that the resolutions of the Stability and Growth Pact state that efforts should be made to balance the budget .
The EU must pursue political dialogue with Nigeria , under Article 8 of the revised Cotonou Agreement , and urgently tackle issues relating to freedom of thought , conscience , religion or belief , as enshrined in universal , regional and national human rights instruments .
However , in my personal opinion , there should be an express reference to the term &apos; compensation &apos; , just as there is in the international contract of employment and just as the experts of the International Labour Organisation have recommended .
Experience tells us that it is quite normal , a quite normal political activity , to seek out majorities in such a situation .
We see it as a means of paving the way for greater support for the European project in Switzerland , which we hope will change its mind in future and decide to join us in the European Union .
This does not make the approach of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund any more tolerable .
– Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , none of us can get these images out of our minds – these images of suffering , death , destruction , mud and tears – and the cries for help , the cries of despair and lamentation , not to mention the stories told by the victims , are still echoing in our ears .
I should like to make a few specific comments based on the statements made by the honourable Members on the role and facility for intervention of the European Union .
They are parties of parties and with them power gets further away from the people .
I agree with the recent comments of Commissioner Patten when he criticised EU governments for making ringing declarations which they are reluctant to underwrite with money and staff .
For that reason , we must take great care to ensure that the proposals which we in the Member States and the Council make are consistent with those standards .
The second point is debt relief , which many speakers have referred to .
It is encouraging because it is in our interests to bind Russia into a rules @-@ based system where it can then be held to account .
We agreed , early on in the year 2000 , that we would make Europe into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge @-@ based economic area in the world , with qualified full employment and greater social cohesion .
I am sure we all agree that , in the European Union , no issue has been as controversial and given rise to as much tension and opposition as that of relations between the European Union and Turkey , and this is understandable , because Turkey has nothing in common with any other country involved in the enlargement process .
What is at stake is the most basic of all human rights , Mr President : the right to live .
What we need to do is evaluate the schools and to make sure that the schools are doing well .
No serious reflection on the concept of quality is provided .
The Lambert report identifies the problems , starts from an accurate assessment and offers solutions in a number of areas .
The worry is that when the EU gets involved it inevitably screws up .
There are countries such as Vietnam , for example , that a few years ago people thought of in a completely different context , but today it is an emerging economy . All of this is true .
It is not acceptable for the Council to increase the number of exceedances for the hourly limit value from the original eight up to 18 , and Amendment No 9 seeks to restore this .
I voted for this joint resolution because I consider the transatlantic relationship to be , without doubt , the most important foreign relationship for Europeans .
These changes and adjustments can be used as an example of a vital , dynamic and effective Europe , which is something we need to make citizens understand and experience on the eve of the European elections .
We hope that Turkey will make substantial progress in the coming years .
Regarding letter of amendment No 1 , the Danish Liberal Party does not believe that the destruction of foodstuffs is appropriate .
There are major industrial interests at stake when it comes to food supplements .
Various studies have shown that the death penalty has no impact on violent crime trends .
OK , I will trust the House .
Madam President , there are , in particular , two aspects of the four groups ’ resolution that I welcome : its affirmation of the multilateral in preference to the bilateral which , with its quotas and such like , always results in the developing countries being the losers ; and , secondly , the EU ’ s obligations in relation to the developing countries .
Mr President , on behalf of the Green Group and pursuant to Rule 129 I must ask for this report to be referred back to committee .
On the other hand , a control mechanism for the exploitation of raw materials in Congo must be set up .
&lt; empty &gt;
Finally , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her stimulating report and to stress the Commission &apos;s determination to maintain its efforts to overcome the problems faced by frontier workers .
It is a remarkable country and it is on the brink of drowning in waste .
Particular care should be taken when children are involved .
We still have a lot of work to do , such as the VAT refund and other issues related to the regulation of utilisation , but I trust that the Seventh Framework Programme will bring us closer to the implementation of the single European Research Area .
Thus , the fate of the deteriorating inner city areas and the large housing estates will only get worse .
As I am sure you are aware , the Liberal Group has signed the joint motion for a resolution .
For now , I believe that it is right to take this path , to link Europe and the southern shore of the Mediterranean ; to start work and see what opportunities present themselves in the future .
Therefore , I think that this threshold should also be reviewed to show that European solidarity really can exist .
I daresay nobody doubts the need for the existing legislation to be updated .
France has done so and is paying a high price .
So I hope you will not blame us for keeping you here at this hour .
An agreement was signed between the IAEA and Euratom , or the Commission , which aims to drive forward the proliferation of nuclear energy .
The single most important factor is the common currency .
That is the situation we are dealing with .
Do I have to remind you that last December it was decided to set up an international intervention force which was disbanded a week later , on the pretext that the Rwandan refugees had returned home , whereas it is now quite clear that there are still several hundreds of thousands holed up in the woods of Zaire .
It is very good to see you in the Chair .
Therefore I would like to call upon the Comission :
Like my colleagues , I am surprised that a number of European countries have not yet ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture .
Following its unilateral decision to withdraw from the Anti @-@ Ballistic Missile ( ABM ) Treaty , the USA has announced its decision to continue developing a national missile defence system until 2004 , beginning with the stationing of missiles in Alaska .
He appears to want to isolate the country completely .
Mr President , the introduction of patents for computer software will not only be damaging for European small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , scientific research and the IT sector as a whole . It would above all be damaging for the average citizen , who has a computer on his or her desk and who already pays through the nose for expensive , protected software .
It can be done another way .
I wish to thank and congratulate the rapporteur on his work .
Given that such a small sum is paid to small farms , which also need a labour force , I think that the Commission should not be looking to make savings from this labour force and from these farms .
The Commission &apos;s proposal unfortunately does not take this sufficiently into account . Moreover , it goes against agreements which have been made on cutting back subsidies for shipyards whilst reducing capacity .
Many assessments would indicate that CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions are likely to increase significantly .
In actual fact , what are most apparent are non @-@ transparent decisions , the diversion of public funds into private interests , whatever the status of the undertakings , the rapid increase in prices for users , the granting of benefits to unethical private groups and the abolition of hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe , while , as for workers &apos; statutes , they have gone right out of the window .
SOLVIT is a very good example of how you can help businesses and citizens .
We were unable to back the Haug report because it proposes a number of essential amendments which are incompatible with our convictions .
This tenet must be amended .
We should now continue working together to ensure trade liberalisation between the Mediterranean partner countries themselves .
In some countries , this cofinancing is clearly a problem – probably a bigger problem for poorer countries than for the richer ones .
My work , and that of many others , to improve this legislation further starts now .
On Monday , in Luxembourg , the General Affairs Council met in the morning with the Foreign Affairs Minister of the Palestinian Authority , a friend of many of us , Nabil Shaat , and in the evening we received the Egyptian Foreign Affairs Minister .
We ask a lot of our delegations .
Mr President , in view of the late hour it would be simplest if I were just to give the Commission &apos;s views on the amendments you are about to vote on .
The industry must be made to give details of the ingredients of the cigarettes , including the tobacco , and just as importantly the filters and additives used to make them .
This was said in recognition of the fact that terrorism must be fought in a manner that is credible and consistent with human rights and that we have to insist on that , especially as the European Union , which is offering possible solutions .
in writing . - ( PT ) Eurojust is a European Union body which helps researchers and the representatives of public prosecutors across the EU work together in the fight against cross @-@ border criminal activity .
I am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys , however worthy the cause .
I should like to respond briefly to your two comments , which amounted , in fact , to a lengthy critical speech , and I shall certainly take note of , and transmit to the Conference of Presidents , your comments on the fact that the debates on this subject have been interrupted for the third time by the midday break . But I would also reflect back the criticism to you , particularly regarding the failure of speakers to keep to allocated speaking times , which has led to our being unable to keep to the planned timetables .
So his solution will not work .
This is a document which , if properly prepared based on a comprehensive , systematic approach , could act as a mechanism for monitoring and streamlining the evolution of EU law .
I think we should take that into account in our dealings and talks with them in the years to come .
Quite simply , time is needed to prepare new features of alcohol policy which may reduce the risks entailed in the abolition of import restrictions .
Without innovation , it will be impossible to achieve the Lisbon Strategy ’ s sustainable growth and employment objectives .
How can the Commission bring itself to say that countries which have replied that they do not want to receive &apos; green &apos; list waste may not be fully aware of the significance of their response for those of their industries that may be able to use waste from the &apos; green &apos; list for recovery or further processing ?
I am merely trying to draw attention to the fact that major tensions are exploding in eastern Sudan , and I should not like us to react in a year ’ s time once it has turned into an inextricable crisis .
I have never accepted that Economic and Monetary Union is a threat to the peripheral regions , just as I have never accepted that the completion of the internal market was a threat to the poorer peripheral states .
It is tough because it necessitates a reconsideration of the logistical organisation of our trading system and of the way we move and travel around .
You are right : as European citizens , we have a right to demand to be treated decently as air passengers and , in the future , as rail passengers .
I think you are right .
We shall see whether , in the course of the Intergovernmental Conference , we can achieve a consensus that will allow us to make further progress on this matter .
Mr President , we have been following this vote with great interest .
( DE ) Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , Mr President of the Council , I appeal to the European Council on behalf of my Group to properly incorporate European transport policy into the integrated guidelines .
They have also stressed that , in this matter , there is a need for complete and open consultation between the United States and its partner .
It is natural that Germany was unable to accept the Nice decision .
It is time we widened the law to include , not just traditional criminal offences , but also infringements of rules on environmental protection and driving and resting times .
That is a starting point for action on raw materials .
Firstly , strategic policy decisions have to be taken .
The Commission communication , which warrants the support of Parliament , presents a strategic framework for such a process and proposes elements for practical action .
What various parts of the Commission are putting out at this time cannot be accepted and is , in some cases , self @-@ contradictory .
&lt; empty &gt;
- ( FI ) Mr President , as we know , the background to this resolution was a very politically sensitive set of circumstances , but that ought not to prevent us from passing a clearly humanitarian resolution that is not watered down by general political remarks on the situation as a whole .
We want to develop a financial framework that can sustain our solidarity commitments with third countries in the Copenhagen Green Climate Fund and , at the same time , foster improvements in accounting rules and our response in terms of both reductions in emissions caused by deforestation and technological cooperation .
This is the equation we have to solve .
Furthermore , the BSE crisis , followed by the crisis of foot @-@ and @-@ mouth disease , caused a fall in consumption and a further fall in produce prices .
Out of the ruins of war there was born the hope and the vision of a brotherhood of the peoples of Europe .
This is not our observation , but that of the Heads of State of Mercosur at their meeting in Asunción last September .
In view of the fact that European industry is clearly in no way to blame for the present critical situation in the US market , in which it has operated extremely well over a long period of time , the United States must be called upon , at the highest political level , to ensure that there is a fairer trade policy .
I should say that we are aware of the differences that exist between different countries as regards what we are discussing today .
I think most of the amendments were agreed in the end so that we have reason to be satisfied , even if it is somewhat after the event .
Certain elements of Amendment No 12 , particularly item ( f ) , may contravene our freedom of association , as enshrined in our constitution .
The European Union ’ s policy on migration and asylum needs to be carefully balanced and indeed carefully considered .
Central banks will no longer regulate the money supply .
As everyone knows , this was not possible before .
Such situations do nothing but harm Europe , which wants to be strong within the global economy .
However , could you comment on the issue of sustaining open access , given that we are now moving into a new era of major investment in next @-@ generation networks in fibre to the home , in which some in the industry are saying there is insufficient incentive to invest ?
We will not achieve anything in the fight against global warming if we reduce CO2 emissions from cars and at the same time increase CO2 emissions by cutting down forests and plants to produce petrol , thus releasing large quantities of CO2 from the ground .
Indeed , the statistics just quoted - one women in ten is or will suffer from this disease - show that it is the most frequent cause of death for women aged between 35 and 55 , and that we might have been able to prevent the deaths of 75 000 women per year if we had set up a much earlier prevention programme .
Ladies and gentlemen , nobody here wants to see events such as these repeated , but we have a responsibility to be realistic . Soon , there will be 25 Member States , and it is quite clear that the climate is changing .
Mr President , like Mr Bianco we too would have preferred to have had answers from the Minister and the Commissioner to the questions raised and the reservations expressed by many people about the opening of these negotiations .
Some quite radical requirements are being proposed and therefore the burden on industry will be too high if the proposals are introduced too quickly .

Primarily , the committee unanimously wants batch control systems to be allowed as well as individual control , and for the Member States to be able to apply both systems according to circumstances .
The report presents convincing arguments in favour of the gradual implementation of this project .
I hope we can do this without dramatising it , but rather evaluate it and look at it from a scientific and evidential point of view .
Mr Lamassoure &apos;s report to Parliament is extremely low on social content and , far from correcting this omission , the votes cast this morning have basically exacerbated it .
I think that we should ask ourselves if it is ethically acceptable to support a system that has such an awful effect on a sector of the population that is as weak as children are .
One of the merits of Mr Eurlings ’ s report is precisely that it avoids doing this .
That has been very much welcomed and respected by Members here .
The polluter pays principle must apply to all .
The debate is closed .
That seems to me an important statement by the President of Iraq at the present time .
I repeat the suggestion to consider the possibility of rationalising the structure of the Court , for example , by capping the number of members and not treating the Court of Auditors as a specific kind of political group .
Fifthly , I do not wish to start a legal discussion at the moment , but I do wish to draw the Commissioner &apos;s attention to the talks being held with the Turkish Government and to ask him to make sure that the Turkish Government does – I repeat – also send the unilateral declaration of the non @-@ recognition of the Republic of Cyprus to the Turkish National Assembly .
This makes even more legitimate our demand for in @-@ depth discussion between Member States and with our partners , before the ratification of the accession treaties and the vote on the future constitution and on the vision of Europe which we intend to promote together in order to respond to the will expressed by our fellow citizens .
The relationship between nature and agriculture is a good example of the fact that it has been difficult to achieve the right balance with the traditional instruments .
Mr President , I should also like to congratulate Mr Sturdy on his report .
There are no problems with the Russian Glonass system .
I also think that Europe should do more to increase the financial commitments .
This will really be an effective way to prevent damaging distortions of competition .
The requirement whereby aid for temporary cessation of activities must be accompanied by a reduction of capacity is withdrawn and replaced by reinstating the current FIFG provisions setting the threshold of Community contribution to all types of temporary cessation .
So let us use common sense .
You want examples of omissions ?
The Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and the European Democrats will be unanimously voting for this agreement .
We need to insist it wages a determined war on terrorism , and that it pursues its reforms .
So speak to the Council ; speak with those who are blocking it .
Two years on , after a report from the Laeken Council and a call from the Barcelona Council for work to begin on a framework directive , we are still at more or less the same point , and the Commission &apos;s only proposal is to put off resolution of the issue once again and draw up a Green Paper which will lead to a huge consultation process .
I must stress that taking a stand against the militarisation of space is terribly important , especially following the recent decision by the United States &apos; government to withdraw from the Anti @-@ Ballistic Missile Agreement and its insistence on developing the so @-@ called anti @-@ missile shield .
This one simply does not work .
Of course competitiveness must be stepped up .
However , these initial measures , on which we will vote today , are not enough to support the producers in crisis , and that is why the Committee on Agriculture , through an oral question and a resolution on which we are preparing to vote , is calling on the European Commission to introduce new and effective measures to combat the crisis and to support the sector .
Mr President , I wanted to reply to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf .
The increase in consignments generally and the frequency of the use of road , rail , waterway and air transport increase both the likelihood of accidents and the need for safety standards in the transportation of radioactive material .
Similarly , the role of public procurement as a catalyst for the environmentally friendly vehicle market is probably an inevitable one .
Various honourable Members have mentioned the mental stress factors which increasingly affect workers .
Those for live cattle should be abolished altogether , certainly when these are exported to countries that are exempt from EU import levies .
We should remember that the men who were instrumental in the massacre of protestors in Burma 20 years ago now hold key positions in the regime .
It is a response to the changed needs of the European Union .
As far as pension rights are concerned , during the Italian presidency we agreed on a regulation covering the social rights and pension rights of workers not only from the new countries , but also from third countries .
The Union estimates that reduction profiles in the order of 15 to 30 % in relation to the Kyoto reference values will be required of the developed countries by the year 2020 ; the long @-@ term aim , according to the conclusions adopted by the Council of Environment Ministers , would be to achieve reductions in the order of 60 to 80 % between now and 2050 .
Ms Shirin Ebadi , who has denounced these abuses at great personal risk , and who won the Nobel Peace Prize as a result , continues to do so on behalf of all ethnic groups and all religious communities .
This matter caused a long discussion , and prevented the early application of the directive .
I hope that at least the Commissioner can understand me .
An agreement on the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the state responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State was concluded with Switzerland in 2004 .
As such , I support the report tabled on Innovation Union , and would stress its importance with regard to the current situation and to European success in times to come .
Gender @-@ based violence covers sexual abuse , human trafficking , forced marriage and genital mutilation , and such violent crimes have an extraordinary impact on and do irreparable damage to a woman &apos;s physical and mental health .
The situation remains extremely alarming in Afghanistan , where , since the Taliban have taken over power , women are no longer allowed to go out to work , are beaten in public for wearing indecent clothing and have hardly any access to medical care .
Accordingly , it makes sense to give the Member States 24 months rather than only 18 .
The company is moving in the right direction , but we should send the signal that throughout the European Union we want fair and balanced industrial relations , and observance of the law , so that consumer disruption of this kind can be avoided and workers can get on with their lives , and so that people with over 30 years ’ service in such companies receive the justice they deserve .
This was not easy , as the rapporteur had to persuade the Member States that , under certain circumstances , the best way of limiting the risk is to limit the use of specific pesticides , which she did with success .
We really need binding force here , the introduction of minimum social and environmental standards in world trade , a binding framework convention on climate , with a biodiversity convention containing climate and biosafety protocols , and an agreement on the protection of forests .
Imprisonment , torture , the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth , are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum .
The report stressed the need for accountability on both sides .
Unfortunately , the level of aid provided by a Union of fifteen Member States , calculated as a percentage of GDP and earmarked for the millennium goals , is decreasing .
If we look at the general approach , too , talking of Kyoto or Johannesburg , we see very little progress .
Subject : Funding of an unplanned conference centre in Liberty Park ( Parko Eleftherias ) , Athens
In relation to the FVO , I should say that I have not sent the FVO to Thailand in respect of this particular outbreak .
The size of the area in which pirates operate makes it hard to deal with the problem of piracy with military resources alone .
Today , when we are getting ready to vote and to approve the resolution supporting the Bolivians and calling for respect and supporting the institutions and the constitutional laws , it only remains for me to call on God and on the Quechuan and Aymaran Gods to enlighten their leaders and to bless and protect the Bolivian people .
We absolutely have to stop the increasing land abandonment , because we need people .
This heading is dramatically underfunded , so we should not allow promises to be made that will never be kept .
In modern @-@ day China , for example , Catholics are deprived of any rights , and the same is true in a great many other countries .
We must aim to abolish the promotion of the transport of live animals .
. Mr President , I am delighted to present these two reports to you .
Compulsory limits have the advantage that they give a clear signal to the motor industry and to spares manufacturers , so that they can adjust their research and development activities effectively , and several of the speakers this evening have stressed the importance of this .
One of the achievements of these last six months was the finalisation of all these processes - the ratification in the Member States .
Mr Rogalski , you were not on the list , and I have closed the explanations of vote .
I shall let you be the judge .
Others - a dogmatic attachment to free trade , competition taken to extremes and the ever increasing European dimension , etc . - are the very cause of the problems that we claim to want to resolve .
What is the Union doing , though , to impose an alternative transport policy or an alternative energy policy ?
In a country such as Spain , and in the countries of southern Europe in general , where minimum wages of PTA 60 000 are common - pitiful wages , that is - the reduction of wages is unthinkable .
Now we have a result that goes far beyond the tests carried out over the last 15 or 20 years , with European involvement and with peer reviews by teams that have been put together at a European level .
I just want to tell the Commissioner that I do not see how he is going to avoid making financial corrections for the Member States in settling the EAGGF accounts when the time comes .
Secondly , today &apos;s debate shows that the issues are complicated and cover a broad political field . There are a lot of questions .
The second , issued earlier this year , is specifically a call for action to strengthen the rights of poorest workers , and there will be a study to better understand the phenomenon of precarious work as well .
There have been environmentally @-@ friendly cars in the past , and low @-@ consumption models too - think of Mercedes &apos; Smart car , which led to billions in losses for the company .
The majority of dangerous products thus come from a market that is almost impossible for the EU to control .
According to available data , even with average rainfall over the coming months – and the forecasts do not suggest in any way that this will be the case – we could be facing a situation that only happens once every 40 years .
I think this is another reason why , in future , the Commission should publish all four important reports monitoring the internal market at the same time .
Protection of workers from the risks of explosive atmospheres
We also want the guidelines actually to be implemented .
Both of these things are possible .
Moreover , I welcome the somewhat belated transposition , by virtually all Member States , of the directives relating to classification societies and to port state control , to which the Commissioner referred , while waiting for a more positive attitude from Finland .
Mr President , I will be seeking to round off the excellent work of my colleague , Mrs Thyssen , with a few further considerations , prompted by the fact that while it is true that many programmes of intervention and support for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises - the issue we are this evening discussing - have been set in place , less satisfactory results have been achieved when it comes to improving the context in which those enterprises operate .
The Council has not yet been able to adopt the Commission proposal to this effect , and I appeal urgently , not only to the Government of the Republic of Cyprus , but also to a number of other Member States , to ensure , as a matter of urgency , that the policies of the international community and of the European Union in relation to Cyprus are implemented .
The result is there for everyone to see - Christianity is the most persecuted religion in the world .
I wish to thank Mr Libicki , chairman of the Committee on Petitions , for his comments , and to assure him that I look forward to working closely with him in promoting the joint and common goals of the Ombudsman in that committee .

Firstly , I must tell you ( although I think you already know ) that one of the first projects under the Meda scheme , which came into effect in October , is the Manform project being implemented in Tunisia , with a fund of ECU 40 million .
The debate is closed .
On 25 September , the Council gave its support to this initiative on the basis of a compromise proposed by the Presidency . This compromise focused , on the one hand , on the definition of higher professional qualifications and of higher education qualifications , and , on the other , on the relationship with national law ; lastly , it focused on the minimum salary threshold for which a derogation is provided for in case of specific need within a profession .
On this matter our intentions perfectly match those of the Commission .
According to its doctrine , great wealth is needed to qualify for health and education .
Any discussion on the reform of the CAP will take place at the right time .
That must be the bottom line .
Once again , we are doing the opposite of what should be done , and this is unfortunate for our children .
Thank you , Mr Oreja .
I am also counting very much on Parliament &apos;s support in this matter .
We will also have to be just as definite in making up our minds about this last aspect .
As you know , only measures within the Member States can be financed under Interreg .
The new internal and external consultations with voluntary organizations and foundations were essential mainly for two reasons : first , because of the enlargement of the European Union , and secondly , so that account could be taken of all the new initiatives developed by the Commission in the last two years - because I remind you that this document first appeared four years ago .
Furthermore , it is a common sense requirement if we want our fishing to be a viable economic activity and our fishing sector to be a viable economic sector .
We are not all uneducated and illiterate .
. – Mr President , safeguarding the security of the electricity supply and ensuring an adequate level of interconnection between the infrastructures of the Member States is absolutely essential , particularly at a time when we are planning to set up and enhance the single market for energy .
It clearly is appropriate .
COFACE , the Confederation of Family Organizations in the European Communities , notes that the current system is of virtually no interest for consumers .
It was , however , possible to do so on this one . This screwdriver contains nickel cadmium , while this one ( contains nickel metal hydride .
At least 500 people , including two Europeans , have been killed and 2 million Chileans have been affected by the earthquakes .
It is not for me to analyse every amendment separately here because there is certainly not enough time .
Although action plans established by the high @-@ level working group aim to limit migratory flows in the future , these plans do nothing to improve human rights , civil liberties and the economic situation in the countries concerned .
However , Parliament &apos;s rules force us to present separate resolutions with no opportunity to vote on individual amendments .
They have to show the political will to do what is necessary ; and if they do not , I say to the honourable Members , we will have to do more to keep the pressure on .
Mr President , I should like to start , on behalf of the Communist Party of Greece and the Greek people in general , by expressing our solidarity both with the political prisoners in Turkey and with all the Turkish people who suffer under the Turkish regime .
As for the European Council of 12 and 13 December , we basically agree with the great objective of enlargement , but there are still two major problems outstanding .
The WEU can in some ways also close the gap by accommodating neutrals and there can be closer cooperation between neutrals and non @-@ neutrals if we are prepared to be imaginative and to take off the blinkers and look at security and cooperation in a broader sense without getting into name calling and by looking at the real needs of the European Union and its Member States .
Member States must be free to sign bilateral agreements with third countries .
Here , we need to continue combating sources of errors decisively through simpler rules and recovering funds wrongly paid .
There are a great many good amendments in the proposal , but I would like , in particular , to highlight one amendment which ensures that the needs of particularly vulnerable applicants are taken into account , particularly those of unaccompanied minors .
From an ethical standpoint , there must be an upper limit of pain , suffering and distress above which animals must never be subjected in scientific procedures .
Added to this , the fishing sector is in crisis .
In parallel with the Union &apos; s possible membership of a world @-@ wide drug testing agency , we feel that a European plan is needed , a plan which will make us all responsible , with all fifteen Member States marching to the same rhythm in the fight against the plague of drug taking in sport .
We need to work much more closely together on identifiable objectives .
First of all , we wish to extend the scope of the directive so as to include dust from certain types of wood , and category 1 and 2 mutagens .
The costs of these next year would be in excess of EUR 20 million .
As far as I am aware , the cost of producing garlic in the European Union is of the order of 220 pesetas per kilo whereas Chinese garlic is priced at around 135 pesetas per kilo . Clearly , the ensuing fall in the price of garlic could cause a significant upheaval in the Community market .
These include dense black coral forests , some more than two metres in height .
The final component - which will be very important - is contained in Article 8 . That requires the managers of pension schemes to provide all relevant information for scheme members wishing to exercise their right to move to another Member State .
This vote represents an unprecedented halt for European research .
All of us are Europe !
It is indeed vital for the European Union to give due consideration to the future role of the Euro @-@ Mediterranean area as regards peace , economic development , democracy , energy provision and economic investment .
The way that a football world championship binds peoples together has a quite special significance .
Finally , the development we anticipate is one in which more and more cars are equipped with safety devices such as alcohol locks and reminders to drivers to fasten their seat belts and switch their lights on .
Contrary to what has been suggested by Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit , it is possible to table amendments , indeed - according to the e @-@ mail - some members intend to do so .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , taking the floor in the debate on the 2007 budget on behalf of the UEN Group , I would like to remind you that this budget is an extremely important financial plan for the European Union for at least two reasons .
I will now dictate the minutes which I wanted for Tuesday and that I asked again to be reinstated . It should read &apos; Mr Hallam complained that the proposed Council Regulation 96 / 0247 banning the use of nickel in the new euro coin on health grounds was based on a myth .
( ES ) Madam President , violent Islamic fundamentalism that targets the West but also harms Islam is on the increase in the Middle East and the Maghreb .
Now , documentary evidence is accessible which shows that the Nazis themselves in the 1930s went to Moscow to acquire experience in the organisation of mass murder .
Mr President , I found this a lengthy and interesting debate , and I have already trespassed on your generosity to intervene twice , so I will be brief , and thank the speakers for the important interventions which we have been able to hear today , which covered a large part of what the Commission together with the proposals on EMU regards as one of its most important proposals during this term of office .
In this case , which is perhaps the most common use of derivatives by asset managers , you reduce your potential reward but you also reduce your potential risk .
Food prices are no longer soaring in some of those same countries .
I am sure it will provoke solid , but also controversial discussion , and so I would just like to take this opportunity to stimulate debate a little with a two @-@ fold question .
Amendments Nos 4 and 5 are also unacceptable because they give undue preference to copy products by granting them authorisation to be placed into circulation even before an application for authorisation has been submitted .
For it to be successful we want companies and organisations to use it .
But , Commissioner , why choose to abolish the ACR in favour of the customs rate ?
The Commission is aware of the major challenge which the transition to the euro represents for the educational sector .
We have the case law already in place .
It is unfortunate that the European Constitution has not yet entered into force , because the European Constitution and the reforms it provides for would enable us to take the necessary decisions much more swiftly and much more efficiently .
We have done what we needed to do and we have not released all of the information widely via the media and then not participated .
I personally believe that an increase of up to 15 % in the European Regional Development Fund rate , which can be used by Member States to fund energy performance in residential buildings , is a necessity .
This is one problem .
Therefore , in agreement with the other political groups , we wanted to make this resolution into a call for positive action with regard to this associated country situated in the troubled Great Lakes Region .
Mr President , as the European Parliament is the chief guardian of human rights , it is necessary to examine what issues the report deemed important and worthy of consideration .
There are also , however , things to rejoice about .
These restrictions are limited in scope and do not apply to the independent professions , such as shopkeepers , craft workers and liberal professions , which have enjoyed total freedom of establishment ever since enlargement .
I must say that , personally speaking , I believe it is essential that natural disasters are handled separately and as a priority , because , in this case , it is impossible to identify who is responsible and therefore to claim insurance .
It is a pity , though , that the legal basis chosen for this recommendation should be Article 157 of the Treaty , which is intended to ensure the competitiveness of European industry , instead of the more appropriate Article 153 on the protection of consumer interests .
Another idea put forward in my opinion was the promotion of ‘ chosen working time ’ and of voluntary part @-@ time work .
I think it is time Israel understood that its very existence , its very love for democracy , can only exist if it respects other peoples .
Any PR or information campaigns will be an uphill struggle , a waste of money and time , unless they are in the context of sound economic management .
To touch on the points raised by Mrs Lulling , we have an existing legislative framework and we will ensure that it is implemented properly .
Fifthly , the questions of finance for businesses , especially SMEs and risk capital , cannot be overlooked either .
In addition , it is important that the objectives and deadlines be carefully specified in connection with the agreements and that they also be sure to cover a representative sample of the relevant businesses and production in the area in question , so that one group of businesses is not given the opportunity to freewheel .
The fight against organised crime and the improvement of border protection must finally be more valued in the European Union .
As for passenger traffic , that is an entirely separate matter : the most important factor with regard to service in this area is keeping strictly to the timetable .
If we merely follow this policy over the coming months , will it not lead to an economic slowdown , at a time when we actually need to stimulate growth ?
Indeed , these improvements have become necessary as a result of the emergence of new services such as Internet radio , streaming and downloading services for which a fee must be paid .
My fellow Members will have noted the breadth of the debate stirred up by Article 6 on bioethics , in relation to which the compromise amendment tabled by the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy was accepted by a margin of little more than 40 votes , which is certainly a substantial , but not a majority , margin .
Mr President , I fear that this very important debate on the Financial Perspective will breed frustration , because the Council is proposing something of a shoestring budget which does not match Europe ’ s ambitions .
Finally , I should like to say that such hurried changes to legislation tend to arouse suspicions that vested interests are involved .
– ( ) I voted in favour of this report because I regard it as very important for all regions that are unable to initiate their own development measures without financial support .
These enable all European allies to make a coherent and effective contribution to the Alliance and to act by themselves as agreed and required .
This automatically leads to the need for legislation and directives in those countries , but also sanctions , hence also an amendment .
I want us to be allowed to get on with it , and I want us to be as accountable as possible to this Parliament and to the Council for what we are doing .
We also support the reinforcement of relations between the EU and the United Nations .
In these weeks and months , looking forward to the enlargement of the European Union , our gaze is directed principally towards the East , but it is important that we turn our eyes southwards , as the perils there are probably far greater than our problems in Eastern Europe .
I think that everyone has understood that you believe the report to be a good report , but I cannot give the floor to all the rapporteurs and former rapporteurs , as you will clearly understand .
I intend to write a formal letter to the German Government to recommend that specific preventive measures be taken during the 2006 football World Cup to prevent the influx and concentration of persons who would , unfortunately , be destined to go into prostitution during that period .
I am also in favour of all the requests for prior information , impact assessments and so on set out in this resolution .
The objective was to adapt environmental standards , if necessary , to the higher national standards .
I appeal to the Commission – and I would say the same thing to the Council – to adopt , once and for all , a tougher approach to dealing with Burma .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to express my great satisfaction that today we are tackling a subject like this with an important question , for which I warmly thank the authors , and I would also like to express my gratitude for the high level of cooperation that we have seen between all the political parties and the two committees .
This will ultimately produce considerable savings for the taxpayer and will also create extra scope in future budgets .
Not least in my own country , which has the longest external border with the new Member States , there are more and more citizens of the new Member States in the workforce .
I would also ask colleagues to consider this particular situation and support our amendment , which is number 89 .
But we must also ensure that the measures which should be taken at national and regional level in accordance with subsidiarity are indeed implemented .
The Union must not act in a reactive manner , in response to events , and then forget those issues that were previously priorities .
. ( FR ) As it aims to ensure that the current programme of action to combat violence against children , young people and women will continue after its expiry at the end of 2003 , it must be possible to implement this second phase of the Daphne programme without delay .
I feel that each government is best placed to develop the most suitable approach on a country @-@ by @-@ country basis , depending on the particular sensitivities , and the political and social context peculiar to the country concerned .

Mr President , I am deputising for Mr Girão Pereira , who was to present his report yesterday .
It has been stated in quite a few newspaper articles that the Commission intends linking demands for liberalisation of services in other countries to a reduction in , or removal of , EU export subsidies in the agricultural sphere .
Let us act in such a way that the reform of the agricultural policy does not involve penalizing zones and regions privileged because the fruit of the work of centuries gives typical and noble food products .
The photovoltaic sector , which is not even the biggest sector , is recording an annual market growth of 15 % .
Although some sceptics still doubt the phenomenon of global warming , nobody can doubt the cooling of relations between the EU and the US over its refusal to recommend ratification of the Kyoto Protocol .
In Seville a fundamental step forward was made in admitting that , in extraordinary cases , the Council may use the direction of the discussions of the European Council in order to continue to make progress on particular matters , in accordance with the procedures established in the Treaties .
After that came Vietnam and Thailand .
The three major ones are , without a doubt , terrorism , weapons of mass destruction , and conflicts among our neighbours with direct effects on the European Union as a result of floods of refugees having a direct impact on the public in it .
For a long time the European Parliament and its committees have complained there are not enough staff working on &apos; women and development &apos; at the Commission .
Regard for this subject has also declined since the Red Card campaign and the World Cup .
I disagree with her in many regards , but one really has to give her credit for her commitment .
Peace in Afghanistan ?
We are aware that the western world shares overall responsibility for the worsening of the crisis that many of these countries are suffering .
This proposal dates from 1994 and thus far neither the Council nor the Commission has done anything to break the deadlock .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , two years ago , we held a debate in this House and adopted an exacting resolution on the subject of water on the occasion of the Fourth World Forum held in Mexico City .
The most hopeful thing we have heard in some time were the comments made by President Trichet reported in today &apos;s press , where he said that he could see a recovery coming in 2010 .
It has different rules ; it has a general ban but it also has exemptions .
In that regard , I should mention that the next opportunity for discussion on the situation in China will be as early as next week , on 15 May , when the next round of the EU @-@ China Human Rights Dialogue will take place in Ljubljana .
As you can see , the Council has ensured that its draft budget adequately covers the priorities within the internal policy of category 3 of the financial perspectives .
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is pleased that the European Commission has kept its word , for a year ago , when Parliament adopted my report on biogas , we agreed with Mrs Fischer @-@ Boel that there would be no separate biomass directive , but that we would address the question of biomass in the context of renewable energy sources .
It only remains for me to express my gratitude to all the shadow rapporteurs for their help , thanks to which it was possible to complete a fruitful piece of work , and to the services of the Commission and the Council , including the Spanish Presidency and now the Belgian Presidency , for the work that we have carried out over these months .
That means that we must completely rethink the cost estimate for trans @-@ European projects , and I would call on you to do that .
The underlying principle of any legislation on food is the protection of human health , and for this very reason , it is vital to introduce the precautionary principle in risk management when scientific data is insufficient or inconclusive .
Nevertheless , the Members of the Commission also understand the worries globalization can cause , which have been expressed here this evening , and is convinced that we need to study more carefully how to define a framework for global liberalization which will guarantee that future growth benefits a great many people throughout the world and also represents a benefit rather than a cost to the environment of the planet .
Under international rules , restrictions to imports of products must be based on legitimate concerns , not be discriminatory , and be proportionate to the objective pursued .
I think , then , that we have a good result and I want to thank everyone involved .
Interestingly , various sides have today voiced the view that the Commission must have great jurisdiction , either in order to carry out environmental impact studies or in order to impose various policies .
We must ask ourselves , therefore , whether this is the right approach to finding a solution , given that the inequality between supply and demand in the regional labour markets is to be balanced by means of initiatives to facilitate migration .
Last week I had a chance to see it in action out there .
We , here in Parliament , are concerned that the Commission should have decided not to publish a report on the situation in Jerusalem , which was a report agreed to by all of the Union &apos;s services working there .
The parliamentary committee adopted several amendments that enrich our proposal with references to European values .
Similarly , particular emphasis must be given to disseminating routine child and maternal health care , so as to reduce mortality rates .
On the basis of this report , the main objective of the radio spectrum policy programme is broadband coverage by 2013 for all citizens of Europe , and high speed Internet by 2020 .
Impact studies should be applied to all legislative proposals , they should have a clear methodology , and they should be undertaken with full independence and transparency .
So what should be done ?
There is a reason for it , and I have a document in front of me , dated August 2000 , entitled &quot; The American Servicemembers &apos; Protection Act of 2000 : Implications for US cooperation with the ICC &quot; .
This may be true in some circumstances , but what has seemed surprising to us is the way in which one Palestinian institution after another has been destroyed or badly damaged as though some people believe that the aim of the exercise should be to undermine the ability of Palestinians to actually create an administrative structure for a future Palestinian state .
The issue where Chechnya is concerned is really one of whether this is to be the last tragic convulsion of an unhappy century or the start of a new century which is just as tragic .
If we do not reach agreement , then there is a risk of paralysis which will have a very negative effect on our policies and on all the Member States , particularly the new Member States .
Either way , it is a creeping venom seeping into our open society and becoming a burden on it .
It pays for companies to invest in environmentally friendly technology .
As this debate draws to a close , the request I should therefore like to make to the Commission is that in future we , that is the Council , the Commission and Parliament , discuss how democratic and economic reforms in those countries can be better and more effectively supported and how we can target the PHARE programme more selectively .
Indeed , it is the tangible expression of solidarity within the European area , which is the most visible on the ground , as close as possible to regions and citizens , in the areas where they live and where the European Union can speak directly to each one .
As regards financial management , we have to be able to establish exactly what we require of the careful management of finances .
This area of investment is all the more important inasmuch as it is a fact that Parliament especially emphasizes the importance of responsible fisheries measures , and also that the Cape Verdean authorities have used the specific financial resources allotted to technical and scientific programmes under the agreement very correctly - I was able to check that on the spot .
We now have the evidence and the opposite is the case , because part @-@ time work has come to be seen as a positive option .
Mr President , I do not know if the House noticed , but yesterday was also the record snowfall in Korea for 100 years , so it is not just a few places .
The vote will take place today .
It is an awful pity that Parliament , the Commission and the Council did not listen to us in the past when we asked for cohesion funding for Northern Ireland .
Such a possibility of redirecting community funds , as is proposed here , will very easily lead to countries with strong economies playing monetary games with exchange rates at the expense of economically weaker countries , which will not be able to do anything about it .
Finally , halting deforestation is particularly important as far as developing countries are concerned , yet I gather that the European Union is now divided as to the role of forests , especially thanks to Sweden , Finland and Austria .
We must ensure that our attitude can never be interpreted in this way as this could lead to the very worst xenophobic reactions in Russia .
Lucas Report ( A5 @-@ 0036 / 2001 )
The concept of a &apos; similar medical product &apos; should be given a more detailed scientific definition in order to take into account current scientific developments and the characteristics of the products .
To Mrs Isler Béguin &apos; s question on renewable and nuclear energies , I should like to answer first of all that , at the moment , the priority is to encourage an increase in the use of renewable energies .
We have had disagreements , Mr President , but I am sure that whatever the result achieved in this House tomorrow , the work of the Committee on Legal Affairs will have moved this issue forward significantly .
Are there any objections to Mr Pasty &apos;s proposal ?
The third fundamental misunderstanding is that it will destroy the competitiveness of agriculture .
Where our relations with the poor countries are concerned , Commissioner Wallström has already pointed to the water and energy initiatives .
The Union must claim a more prominent role in the Quartet , and I hope that this will happen under the Italian Presidency .
( PL ) Madam President , the cultural heritage of European countries is , in itself , something of value .
But if you read Article 104 of the Treaty once again , you will see that , once the European Commission informs the Council that a certain country is , in its judgement , in a situation of excessive deficit , the Council has full powers , following an overall assessment — Article 104 ( 6 ) of the Treaty — to decide ‘ ‘ whether an excessive deficit exists ’ .
Let it be clear , therefore , that there is no question of opening a debate on the substance of the matter .
Asia cannot be compared to the European Union .
As regards the allocation to these funds , we await with interest the Council agreement on the Financial Perspective for 2007 @-@ 2013 , which we hope will be equal to the new challenges facing the EU ’ s cohesion policy .
In order to raise awareness of this among the Member States , the business community and individual consumers , the EU has specified collection targets , which the new directive aims to amend .
I am therefore surprised that there are still many in this discussion who still believe that the liberalisation of the world food trade is the perfect solution to resolve all evils in development cooperation and the fight against poverty .
More basic changes are needed when it comes to the rules governing the registers .
Those who are concerned about human rights , animal welfare and the environment have a much better prospect of securing improvements in those areas within a legal framework and a World Trade Organisation than they have in a free @-@ for @-@ all , law of the jungle .
The European Union has already made an important contribution , but we must ask that efforts be intensified to provide relief in this appalling human catastrophe .
Once again , this House is undermining its own foundations !
Energy from gas is a clean form of energy - though not to the same extent as hydraulic energy , for example , or other renewable forms such as wind energy - and we need the Commission to provide a stimulus .
This solution lies in the harmonisation and interpretation of the legislation .
That is why I am concerned that the United Kingdom , but also Spain and Italy , are going down a path that suggests that this solidarity could be undermined .
The first evaluation report , which was the subject of Mrs Kokkola &apos;s report , made it very clear that the statements and documents were by no means being implemented in practice by the Commission and the Member States .
If action is , in fact , taken against them , it will undoubtedly help create an atmosphere hostile to the press in general .
( ES ) Mr President , I naturally voted against the Auken report , and I should like to state here that the report that has been adopted goes against the letter of the law .
It is strict in terms of our public accounts , and we will put it into practice .
The official policy of the EU must be open and clear to everyone , not disguised or covered up .
However , I shall also examine this issue from the point of view of the human factor : often illegal fishing has repercussions on the safety of crews , given that they only have minimal guarantees in respect of the terms of employment and safety of human life at sea .
The loss of employment outside of Germany is now forming a disproportionate burden on a large number of sectors .
Closer cooperation between law enforcement authorities has been one way of trying to achieve added value in internal security in the enlarged Union .
Mr Brown , the British Minister for Agriculture , said himself that he would not be buying French food .
But the Commission cannot be alone in bearing the consequences of its conduct .
The idea was that the whole European Union area would acquire a high level of environmental protection .
Social policies mean that prevention , the ability to predict , to prevent and to resolve conflicts before they happen must be part of all European Union policies , as has already been pointed out by other Members , and these policies must provide for an investment in terms of both financing and human resources .
I am therefore sorry to see that this report does not suggest any real approach for counteracting this .
Mr President , I originally wanted to thank Commissioner Karl De Gucht for breaking with the approach of his predecessor , who circumvented the European Parliament as the only directly @-@ elected European institution and failed to provide information on the process of negotiating this agreement , but I feel rather embarrassed because I was always brought up to show respect for important personages and the fact that Mr De Gucht was ostentatiously cleaning his glasses while my colleague Mr Kamall was standing here has therefore quite thrown me .
We have entered the ratification period which - as we know from the 2005 experience - is the most sensitive stage in enacting a new treaty .
Mr President , I would like to pay a special tribute to the German Chancellor , Angela Merkel , who has become the new Margaret Thatcher of Europe .
The presidency is looking forward to the Court &apos;s forthcoming special report on the functioning of UCLAF .
We have now gone over by more than the amount of time we were late by when we started .
The Palestinians affected by the agreement have been transferred to various Member States of the Union - Spain , Belgium , Ireland , Italy and Portugal - to be accepted , for humanitarian reasons , in line with the common position reached by the Council on 21 May .
. Honourable Members , thank you for giving me the opportunity to address Parliament shortly before our yearly EU @-@ US summit , which will take place in Washington on 20 June .
We welcome them to our debate .
The debate is closed .
In all this work there is a clear recognition that we need to tackle this serious problem of our high level of unemployment and the social exclusion which it entails .
Against that background , we therefore support these three proposals .
Madam President , it is true that sport is so much more than just a game .
Its starting point is beyond dispute .
I was at a conference last week .
The cohesion policy must be one of the basic pillars of our economic policy .
Some of the amendments on which we will be voting tomorrow in plenary may now alter this compromise and balance , and I call on my fellow Members , and the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs in particular , to come up with a balanced measure that is acceptable to all .
In the negotiations with Parliament , the Council gave its agreement to including an express mention of the Roma population in the Decision establishing the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All .
Secondly , Council gave particular attention to complying with the annual expenditure ceiling set by the current Financial Perspective and to leaving adequate margins below the ceilings – where possible – so that there is some room to finance unforeseen events during 2006 .
Amendment No 2 , in its first part , is identical to Amendment No 1 , but concerns foodstuffs other than alcoholic beverages .
In Germany we have the Capital Investors &apos; Test Cases Act , under which numerous shareholders have brought a group action against Deutsche Telekom ; it has become evident in the course of these proceedings that the theory and practice of collective redress are often poles apart .
You can only make points of order to the Chair .
Here in particular - and people have spoken of a trialogue - the Council , Parliament and the Commission must work together to achieve their goal .
The debate on innovation which is currently under way in the European Union has revealed the extreme importance of technological innovation and protecting it effectively .
That is a sin from the past ; the company concerned has gone and the mess needs to be cleaned up .
The nature of restructuring varies from region to region .
It has to be said , unfortunately , that the debate on the opening of the accession negotiations with Turkey and the text of the resolution are being overshadowed by two issues , firstly the recognition of the Republic of Cyprus , and , secondly , the extension and implementation of the customs protocol , also again in relation to Cyprus .
The debate is closed .
That does not alter the fact that I can agree with many paragraphs of the resolution .
Thank you , Mrs Gradin .
Mr President , it may well be that your lawyers have found a way round the political obligations of this Parliament .
Mr President , you fought against the Soviet Union .
To me , this raises the issue of the need to maintain the agency in its current form and organisation .
That goes for the position being adopted on the alleged positive impact of tax competition just as much as for the manner in which it deals with the actual subject matter , namely the tax treatment of losses in cross @-@ border situations .
Creditworthiness is , of course , always a prerequisite of liquidity and , therefore , the discussion about the creditworthiness of companies , banks and employees is particularly important .
In particular , the Working Group on Motor Vehicles and Parts established by the FTA will examine practical aspects of implementation to ensure that market access problems are addressed in an effective and speedy manner .
I am satisfied that the compromise package will allow the EU take the lead in environmental protection whilst respecting the integrity of national legal systems .
Of course the criminal organizations know how inefficient Europe , this Union is , better than the Union knows the criminal organizations .
It is a grave offence and a huge infringement of fundamental human rights which forces people into dependence through threats , violence and humiliation , and should be subject to a minimum sentence of 10 years .
Madam President , thanks are due to Mr Haarder for a basically splendid piece of work .
Therefore , the situation really is different when we have problems of this severity in poor countries and poor regions , especially in mountainous and tourist regions , as in the case of Madeira .
New developments in public procurement (
Mr President , I must firstly congratulate the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations on being the group with the most representatives in the House at the moment .
However , I believe that a majority of Europeans , a majority of Members , understood it long ago .
These numbers have recently increased dramatically .
It would be sending out entirely the wrong signal - certainly in the present circumstances - if we sought for whatever reason to put off finalising that common strategy on Russia .
Countries which commit fraud must leave .
The Commission will pursue several actions to address this situation , such as accelerating the creation of a European Energy Market Observation System within the Commission .
Mr Dell &apos;Alba , though , is also right to draw attention to the fact that we must ensure that there are no disparities or discriminations in our Rules .
Presidencies , which are short @-@ lived , may come and go , but a common platform of well @-@ defined objectives must remain , at least over the long term , because at the end of the day the European Union must be a union not of governments , but of ordinary citizens , and this is a challenge that we must face , and in which I wish all actors of the European institutions success in 2007 .
It is a good thing to have big multinationals , banks and insurance companies which operate worldwide producing their annual accounts to a single standard .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
I would like to draw the attention of the Council to one point : territorial division .
Mr President , I propose that we now vote on the draft legislative resolution , to confirm the rejection of the Austrian initiative .
I think Mr Santini would agree that is a difficult and contentious area and one which , if reopened , will negate much of the valuable work that has been done .
In this particular circumstance , it would be very satisfying for those who might be listening to the debates in my constituency , Mr Corbett &apos;s constituency or across the UK , that you can assure them that the floods will be included , as we stated in paragraph 2 of the motion for a resolution from our group , and that the aid will be given as soon and as expeditiously as possible .
I would also like to thank the Commissioner for his proposal in which we will be given the opportunity to exchange ideas here with Parliament which is , after all , eminently suited to express its opinion on this matter .
But let me reassure you that in the Development Council , and in the Commission as well , we have been looking very carefully at all the potential inconsistencies between CAP policies and development policies .
This aim will be thwarted by the contradictions inherent in the capitalist system and therefore has little chance of success .
The first is the fact that the Montreal Convention , which governs matters globally , has not yet been ratified by sufficient countries to give it binding effect .
It is not for taking the final decision .
However , in order to be able to implement these European Council recommendations without delay , the Commission means to give concrete form to this new stimulus to employment , beginning with the extraordinary meeting of the European Council in Luxembourg devoted to this subject .
I cannot yet tell you whether safeguards will have to be applied or not .
Well , we have heard your views .
Such is the case with air pollution .
Commissioner Fischler , I see the fact that there is now a structural line devoted to &apos; rural areas &apos; as a great triumph on your part .
As he is aware the Council attaches great importance to human rights and fundamental freedoms .
In our opinion , it also means that the economic guidelines should actually be economic and social guidelines , on which not only the Ministers for Economic and Financial Affairs express their opinion , but also the Ministers for Employment and Social Affairs , the Ministers for Education and possibly the Ministers for Science Policy .
We must also do everything in our power to strengthen SMEs , as they are key actors in European industrial production .
It means that we shall not learn about the effects of chemicals .
As a Liberal , I perhaps eventually realised that it is probably not the state ’ s and the authorities ’ task to say that the one producer is good and the other bad .
Firstly , in the area of agreement , we share the rapporteur &apos;s view that this balance of payments facility should continue beyond the establishment of the Euro in Stage III , but only for those states that are in a pre @-@ in condition . I agree with Mr Herman .
This freedom must be respected .
I firmly believe this is not the direction in which the people of Pakistan would like their country to move .
We have to imagine what is happening over there .
We support the efforts for a new association agreement , under the framework of the Eastern Partnership , which goes beyond opportunities for trade and investment .
The European Union is not taking any practical steps in this direction .
The presidency &apos;s assessment of our agenda abroad is also sound .
That is why the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations has been unable to approve the Viola report .
But when such a man as Abraham Serfati who spent more than ten years in Moroccan jails confirms these small steps in the field of human rights , who are we to dismiss them out of hand and refuse to count their weight in balancing our scales for or against an agreement .
If the Commission does not get active quickly enough , the whole project will end up in smoke .
Common sense and hard facts tell us that we should go back to the spirit of the Treaty of Rome , in other words , the joint exercising of certain economic competences in an associative rather than a supranational manner .
Established limits to markets agreed in one country or region are being overtaken by global competition between all countries .
The Belgian presidency will enable us to contribute to that process which will give us a Europe of 25 countries in just three years , but will also bring us a more democratic Europe which is tangibly closer to the principle of subsidiarity , Madam President .
There is no doubt there are serious problems and the two countries have to maintain a high rate of reform .
At the same time , there must be close cooperation between the competent authorities and the economic operators in the chemicals industry .
We look forward to continued close cooperation with the European Parliament as we take our human rights work forward in the months ahead .
Thirdly and finally , yes , we need these Eurobonds for investment .
Accordingly , and in light of the fact that the report makes reasonable and workable proposals , I voted in favour .
On the one hand , there is the insurance aspect , that is to say , being collectively covered against the main social risks and on the other hand the assistance aspect that expresses solidarity .
Will the Green Paper have to be adjusted in the light of all the new agreements and all the new policy measures we are busy shaping ?
We know that it is the most heavily militarised area in the world .
I therefore urge you , Madam President , and I am sure that I am not just interpreting the will of the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian democrats ) and European Democrats , but also the opinion of the European Parliament as a whole , to give Senator Andreotti formal recognition for the clarity , the far @-@ sightedness and the great democratic uprightness that distinguishes this valuable and useful European figure .
( The Minutes were approved )
Of course , it does not make much sense if a two @-@ wheel vehicle achieves marvellous emission limit values on the test bench if in practice , after just a few thousand kilometres , these limit values are history .
We thought it useful to adopt , in the form of amendments , other conclusions which were not adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , particularly regarding the need for fast , effective civil law protection for intellectual property rights , and the need for realistic , appropriate and effective legislation on patents .
We have to engage in a debate .
For goodness &apos; sake , we are , after all , living in the third millennium AD !
Voting time ( continuation )
On the common agricultural policy : the Berlin package contains the widest @-@ reaching reform ever of the common agricultural policy .
It is a great shame that the Council is not here .
I would like to see the Urban programme and other European @-@ led initiatives - five , six at the most - remain so that the people can see that this comes from the European Union .
I regret the fact that it has put both amounts in the reserve , but fortunately , thanks to our intervention , the Committee on Budgets is to take the amount for consumer policy out of the reserve again , and the legal basis for this is expected shortly .
I do not have time to go into specific areas , but I would like to stress that the priority attention paid by the Rumanian authorities to the issue of competition and State aid has yielded very good results .
All of them have a very specific vested interest in the outcome of these talks because those countries are locked in to a protectionist regime which benefitted them .
That is also in the interest of European citizens .
The battle for social and environmental criteria , which was won mainly thanks to the proposal of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , proves that the European Parliament still basically supports the European social model and sustainable development , which is the only way to make Europe competitive in a global environment .
But it also handicaps those ports and companies which have become more efficient through their own efforts and want to remain effective .
Europe continues to trail behind the USA in e @-@ business .
I also want to thank Mr Titley for his magnificent report and for having reflected the feelings of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy , incorporating virtually 90 % of the suggestions and conclusions of our committee .
We feel that consumers may well be very confused about exactly what the European Union is proposing and how it will impact on them and on the food that they eat and the labels that they read .
EU backing for a single political party would be death to that party inside Iran .
That is not to say that we are going to abandon the idea of the industrial production of food .
However , we cannot agree to paragraphs 84 and 85 because we think the WTO &apos;s trade rules should be followed in all areas .
I consider it necessary that Member States prepare further coordinated strategies and methods , and implement them effectively in practice , and also that they provide real political support .
After many vicissitudes last autumn , including referral back , we managed to reach a compromise with the Commission involving the creation of a new Annex IIa , based on the EU &apos;s own list under Council Decision 94 / 904 .
Mr President , Presidents of the Commission and of the Council , I wish , first of all , to offer my congratulations to the Greek Presidency for the intelligent and useful work it has undertaken .
This refusal to examine a proposal enabling the Member States to make real economies in 1998 illustrates perfectly the scant interest which the European Parliament takes in States &apos; interests and those of taxpayers in our different countries .
Dialogue also needs to take place with social partners and civil society in order to achieve a fairer society without differences .
Mr President , European Obesity Day is an initiative which brings together medical , patients &apos; and political communities to support overweight and obese European citizens .
Oil is a global issue and can only be solved by global action .
This should perhaps cause us to carefully consider how drastic our precautionary measures should be .
( SK ) Following the discussions on this extensive and challenging piece of legislation , which has taken three years to prepare , many of us in this House were of two minds as to what we should do about REACH .
The Czech Presidency will continue to pursue this effort , because our economy is broadly based on SMEs , so we have our own experience with that .
We are particularly concerned about the special problems faced by SMEs . Under the pressure of competition from large multinationals and also in the context of the conclusion of subcontracting agreements , they will be forced , from the very start of the transitional period , to undertake the necessary technical convergence ( public accounting , infrastructure , etc . ) which may prove fatal for many of them .
Hence my vote against the report .
In my opinion , we should set two targets .
In order to take some of the sting out of administrative decisions , the Commission should give applicants the opportunity to correct formal errors within a set period from submitting the application .
It is offering choices !
That is why I really can only beg you from my heart to have the courage tomorrow to implement this report .
African countries are looking for representation in accordance with their political way .
I see the climate action and renewable energy package as not just an important step but even a great leap , which will counteract the advancing climate change and reinforce Europe &apos;s pre @-@ eminence on the way to an efficient energy policy .
In my opinion it is necessary to switch to renewable energy resources and power stations that exploit the highest possible technology .
. ( EL ) It is two years since the outcry about the numerous - sometimes fatal - illnesses caused by the depleted uranium weapons used by the USA and ? ? ? ? in the Gulf and Yugoslavia , and still nothing has been done .
The protection of fundamental rights is a priority .
Thank you Mrs McGuinness .
These values are universal and indivisible , and so they are valid for everyone .
More tasks could be transferred to the agencies .
So , the problem has nothing to do with the principle of liberalization of the European market in bananas .
I would like to hand in a list in writing summarising the Commission &apos;s position on all the amendments tabled
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , as shadow rapporteur for the Liberal Group , I would like to thank Malcolm Harbour and my other colleagues for their excellent cooperation .
As you know , I have stated this several times and have , in fact , asked for a summit on employment .
Whatever form it might take , the Spinelli draft proposed the idea of founding the Union upon a fundamental Treaty which would be a genuine Constitution for Europe and would hence become the single , general plan which Jean Monnet considered to be the inevitable consequence of concrete achievements .
Following the company &apos;s insolvency application , they are waiting until 30 March for a solution .
Then , before the summer , it reached the port of Kalamata , in Greece , and I have contacted the port and authorities there to ask what the state of the Prestige was in Greece and it was not inspected in accordance with the Paris Memorandum .
Indeed , most of the research effort in the field of neurodegenerative diseases is carried out by Member States , with a relatively low level of transnational coordination , leading to fragmentation and limited sharing of knowledge and best practices among Member States .
Such organisations mainly exist within the framework of the United Nations .
Parliament asks the same of the Council and the Commission .
We must draw all the necessary lessons from the Renault affair if we are to avoid this kind of economic and social disaster .
I am sorry , but what you are proposing is still based on an assumption , namely that this check is carried out .
It must be possible to use electronic telecommunication data , but only in connection with very serious and well @-@ defined crimes and following court decisions .
the report by Edit Herczog , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on the discharge for implementation of the budget of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training for the financial year 2005 &#91; C6 @-@ 0386 / 2006 - ,
That does not mean , however , that the Council is not pursuing Dr Mugraby ’ s case closely .
Nonetheless , you know from your own experience that there is still a very long way to go .
Some years ago the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities was asked to extend to intergroups the rules that require individual Members to declare any outside support received .
However , I would like to underline the main points of this draft budget in the fields covered by the different headings of the Financial Perspective :
I do not believe that we can make progress without a change in EU policy on the Palestinian issue or with regard to many of Mr Rocard &apos;s justified demands .
In reality , this is nothing more than a feature of the anti @-@ Strasbourg sniping which has developed . Let us be completely clear about this and not try to pretend it is otherwise or to evade the issue .
My third comment is that we keep saying the aid must be unbureaucratic .
Similarly to suggest that in the pubs and clubs of Bolton the public are concerned about this on a daily basis is also rather to exaggerate matters .
In response to this consultation two European social partner organisations acting in the hospital and healthcare sector , the European Hospital and Healthcare Employers &apos; Association and the European Federation of Public Service Unions , negotiated with success a framework agreement in July 2009 .
Thank you very much , Mr President , many thanks also to the rapporteur , Mr Mayol i Raynal , and to all the speakers who are present here this evening to discuss an important , albeit statistical issue , which simply concerns the definition of labour cost indexes , which will enable us to better understand what is happening in Europe , how we can compete more effectively , and which are a crucial factor for defining monetary policy .
Well , we cannot accept such statements .
To explain , I regret to say that we have voted against a report that I myself helped to draw up , both as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality and as a member of the Committee on Development .
I now turn to the proposal for a directive on the taxation of savings .
Mr President , the claims made by Mr Podestà and Mr Fiori seem to me to be totally unfounded .
So my request to you is : give human rights a chance , again by referring to them in documents and agreements .
I wish Mr Fjellner all the best and would like to extend my warm thanks to my parliamentary staff , particularly Bent Adamsen and Dominykas Mordas .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Mr van Velzen has again worked skilfully .
I would be happy , Mrs Ţicău , to provide you with all these documents once again .
We also saw the destruction of the European Union &apos;s three pillars contrived at the Treaty of Maastricht . &quot;
The Intergovernmental Conference will come to the European Council through the presentation of a report by the Presidency . This report is ready now .
There is also the usage - and the Council should tell us what purpose they serve - of &quot; square brackets &apos; which are unfamiliar to us . In the Council &apos;s language , these correspond to issues that are being debated by the Member States .
The Commission wishes to discuss dispensation applications individually on the basis of the criteria laid down in the directive , so in that context the precise upper limit is not so critical .
If , though , a financial irregularity has occurred , the money must be recovered , and it is the Member States themselves who must produce it .
Your report expresses concern about the smart card action .
As we will be able to finally judge at the end of this programme of negotiations , the hurdles have been set fairly high .
As far as agriculture is concerned , the EU will be unable to avoid further concessions in market access .
Administrative expenditure must be able to be kept below the financial ceiling by means of internal transfers and savings .
That is why I am pleased that the report recommends not only European measures in the areas of prevention , information and research , but also international measures , by means of the neighbourhood policy and the TACIS programme .
Our concerns have , I believe , been fully met in the draft legislation now before us .
Of course it is essential that results and proposals made by special forums and scientific committees can be monitored , but the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party is against the proposal of a forum to monitor the conversion and implementation of Community regulations which includes Members of the European Parliament .
The rapporteur has taken creditable account of factors that impact on the system , dealt with problematic issues critically , and proposes solutions with regard to the delays .
Johannesburg , which will take place in a few months , will not only be a time for taking stock ; it will also be the moment of truth .
This is an area we have identified as a priority for our development cooperation .
We bid Your Majesty a warm welcome to the European Parliament .
It has joined the Council of Europe .
There will be a Frontex operation in the waters around Malta , where we shall try , with the assistance of experts from the Member States and the support of helicopters from the Member States , to put an end to this human tragedy .
It is also significant that the European Parliament is voting on a Treaty even though none of its Members has been able to read a consolidated version .
Third priority : we wanted the &apos; Erasmus Mundus Masters Courses &apos; to be selected on the basis not only of the quality of the training proposed but also of the quality of the student hosting .
Firstly , there is no doubt that industries producing specific products , such as lysine , are confronted with increased imports , particularly from the United States where production capacity is expanding more rapidly .
This applies to Amendment No 5 , excluding section 1 ; 8 and 9 , section 1 ; 10 and 12 , section 3 ; 15 , 16 , 20 , 22 , 24 and 25 .
Together with the United States , we , the Western world , must focus on individual cases of serious human rights abuses in Iran ( I also refer you to our resolution ) .
This was primarily concerned with two subject areas , the first of which was the challenges to foreign policy currently facing us , notably the developments in the Middle East and the imminent elections in Belarus and Ukraine .
Surely , everyone involved in this issue will want to give praise where praise is due , i.e. to the European Parliament and , of course , the Commission , for the simple reason that they have been urging the Council for years to take the action which it has , I think , now been forced to take - action which will certainly benefit European citizens , consumers , rail passengers and rail freight customers .
I hope that it will put an end to the application of this exemption as soon as possible .
The stakes are high , dear colleagues .
Although the explanatory statement is once again correct , it is wrong in the original German version .
In the formation of regional policy and cohesion policy after 2013 , I consider it absolutely necessary to coordinate these policies in the area of rural development with the other pillar of the common agricultural policy , so that the two policies do not work at cross purposes and lead to mutually contradictory goals .
Such discrimination violates European principles and the concept of the four freedoms , and poses a major threat to the economic productivity of the European Union as a whole .
We all agree that the opening of APC countries towards the European Union must be asymmetrical and gradual , with adequate flexibility in terms of quotas in sensitive sectors and effective safeguarding clauses .
With regard to the directive , I am very pleased that we are now close to a first @-@ reading agreement following swift and constructive dialogue between Parliament , the Commission and the Council .
The principle challenge we have to take up daily if we want to build a more humane Europe is the struggle against suffering : the suffering of men , but also of animals .
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wholeheartedly supports the Commission &apos;s line in the agriculture negotiations with the accession candidates .
Crucially I am not convinced that the Commission has learned the lessons from the dangers of displacing effort , as we saw in the north of Scotland last year .
It should be pointed out that European industries and businesses are bound in Europe by strict social and environmental rules .
I was in Tunisia recently , and I saw how much is being expected of the European Union .
It is also doubtful whether an experiment conducted over just three years can be described as a failure after such a short time .
- ( PT ) Therapeutic cloning , which provides new ways of treating certain diseases , depends on the destruction of embryos , and although it is the technology that has been utilised most , and is therefore the most accessible , it is not the only technology and it is certainly not ideal .
The situation was different when this question was put to the Belgian Presidency a month ago and when the Belgian Presidency prepared its answer .
It would not surprise me if this resulted in more investment in smaller airports in densely populated areas .
At the global level , coordinated action to restart economic growth is essential .
My amendments had actually been reworked by an anonymous reviser .
Could the Commission comment on why this decision was not appealed and why the successful applicants are still awaiting an answer from the Commission , almost two years later , on how it intends to comply with the Court ruling ?
We know that there are a number of criteria and not just cost @-@ benefit , and even there we need to know who is being hit by costs and who is enjoying benefits .
What it leaves for us is a reflection of the disregard of certain members of the outgoing Commission for the need to have a rigorous approach to high standards in public life .
However , if we read the verbatim report , we can see that Mr Knörr Borràs &apos; intervention said : &quot; Madam President , I should like to convey our support and sympathy for the people of Paraguay in the light of another attempted military coup .
A proper balance has been found whereby train drivers and other staff with a direct involvement in safety are covered .
The seriousness of the problem is documented by the judgements of the European Court of Justice , which has been confronted with a discriminatory regime for EU banana imports .
First of all , there is Macedonia , and then Montenegro .
A number of compromise amendments were proposed , but there were also a number of points on which we were unable to reach a compromise , particularly in connection with asylum policy and immigration policy , and it was for this reason , because the Socialist Group did not share our views , that we were obliged to vote against .
Only , as Mrs Cederschiöld pointed out , in the end it does not fully achieve the legal certainty the Council wanted because various shortcomings have not been dealt with . They relate to the minimum rules we are seeking to establish , the minimum rules relating to a punishable offence and in particular the application of the same criminal law norms in all Member States , including those that have not yet introduced the euro but where it could theoretically be counterfeited .
Commissioner Monti &apos;s paper for Verona establishes clearly that tax on the low paid has gone up .
Although it is not officially a Community institution , the Bank embodies the entire philosophy of action that characterises the EU &apos;s cohesion and development policies .
It also suffers from the lack of an independent judiciary and widespread corruption .
This too must be counteracted .
There are two ways out : either abolish the euro and return to the captive nations of this Strawberry Soviet their own currencies , or expel the &apos; problem countries &apos; from the euro .
That would not diminish their guilt , but it would be an act of respect for human rights .
Debate on the future of Europe with the participation of the Prime Minister of Italy , Member of the European Council ( debate )
Our task is to draw closer together , to build up Europe &apos;s stability and its capacity to act , to listen , to be desirous of mutual understanding , to tear down walls and cut through barbed @-@ wire fences - wherever they were or will be set up .
I welcome the work carried out on the basis of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) , not least in supporting the automotive industry , which has been affected by the economic and financial crisis .
May the day come when Palestinians can live at peace with Palestinians and Palestinians with Israelis ; a policy of reconciliation and mutual understanding along these lines may , today , appear to be a long way in the distance , but we in this House , being the representatives of the people of Europe , must support it as a matter of conviction and out of a sense of our own responsibility .
This would replace the third part and clarify matters , as the third part proposed by Mr Bono is ambiguous as regards the exception .
in writing . - Although the Committee on Foreign Affairs welcomes the European Council &apos;s decision to grant Montenegro candidate status , serious problems remain as regards corruption , especially where the building industry , privatisation and the state procurement sector are concerned .
In Bosnia , but also in other countries , we really exposed to public attention how women are victims of rape , where rape is used as a political weapon , not only as an individual shameful act , but also as a political weapon .
In Parliament &apos; s view , the interim target values should be achieved by 2010 , and the final objective , whereby people would be protected throughout the EU from all known atmospheric pollutants , should be achieved by 2020 .
It is also a recipe for interference by third parties and radicalism , fuelled by injustices , either perceived or real .
It is through dialogue that members of this partnership can pursue the shared commitment to achieving peace in the Middle East .
I would like to refer first to the question of the Lisbon Strategy , which I believe is fundamental for providing a response to the outermost regions &apos; problems in this new phase , to the need to adapt all policies and programmes to this situation , and also to the question of guaranteed funding .
Today &apos;s atypical forms of work may become tomorrow &apos;s typical forms .
This involves minimal harmonisation , the setting of professional standards and consumer safeguards as well as mutual recognition between Member States , to enable brokers to enjoy freedom of establishment throughout the Union with rules to ensure prudential care for the good conduct of their business .
Of course , the High Representative has not yet been appointed , so these ideas are still just ideas , that is all .
The European Commission - Commissioner Verheugen - has already responded very promptly to our question , which asked for action to be taken to standardise this equipment , and so today we are here to ask the Commissioner what point we are at .
In particular , looking at reform of the structural funds , will he bear in mind that we should not just look at per capita income or unemployment but also at levels of population density and depopulation in determining areas that should qualify for Objective 1 ?
I think that this is very clear when we look at the measures that President Obama has adopted .
Even if they were achieved , how long would it then take for Turkish society to fall into line ?
Madam President , Mr Davies , the Commission attaches great importance to the voluntary commitment on the part of the automobile industry to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars .
Before we start casting doubt on these countries &apos; European ideals - and those of Member States of the EU - it would be better if we considered viewing all those countries that were the United States &apos; allies in military action as potential bridges between ourselves and Washington .
For example , during one of the meetings I had with railway staff , they proposed a recording device .
The Council Presidency is not the EU ; it is an important manager of a European institution .
The principles of democracy , transparency and accountability of public institutions called for time and again by the outgoing World Bank President must also apply to the operations and decision processes of the World Bank itself .
Energy and climate issues will be the main topics in all future summits between the European Union and third countries or regions until the end of June 2008 , more especially with Japan , Latin America and the Caribbean , the Russian Federation and the United States of America .
Commissioner Michel now has the floor .
In its report on the future development of Frontex , the Commission emphasised that cooperation with third countries is a key element in improving the joint operations carried out by the agency in the long term .
My compliments to the interpreters on keeping up with the speaker !
My amendment and the amendment tabled by the Committee on Fisheries are therefore based on this &apos; exception &apos; .
It also demonstrates responsibility on the part of the EU , while Member States try to meet the requirements of its Stability and Growth Pact .
5 .
( ES ) Mr Romeva , do not be concerned : the Spanish Government will cooperate as it always has done .
Tobacco is no ordinary product of course .
We need to resolve this issue immediately .
Without going into details , I think I can tell the House that the members of the working group for the incorporation of the Charter into the Treaty have expressed broad consensus on the answers to give to the technical issues with which we are wrestling and which concern the modalities and consequences of the Charter &apos;s potential incorporation into a future constitutional Treaty as well as the modalities and consequences of the European Union &apos;s potential accession to the European Convention on Human Rights .
20 .
To be honest , it does not .
– Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to remind all Members of this House , both those who voted for and those who voted against , that the vote was not on whether Turkey should be accepted into the European Union or not .
Indeed I would like more attention to the big science projects in the European research area outside the framework programme .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , thanks to its own process of consolidation , the European Union has an ever more important role and ever greater influence on the global stage .
However , I think that there is an opportunity here .
Membership of the EU , participation in the PFF and association with the WEU will give those countries which have remained outside military alliances greater experience of participating in a co @-@ operation with mutual obligations .
The second point is that its approach is realistic in relation to the upper tax limit , and this will contribute towards reaching agreement with the Council .
Such a statement is blatantly dishonest and he knows that well .
It should also be borne in mind that through regular press conferences and the rapid publication of the transcripts of the questions and answers on the ECB website detailed information about the governing council &apos;s reasoning is made available very shortly after the meetings .
On the one hand we have the Commission ’ s explanatory memorandum openly acknowledging that the North Sea Regional Advisory Council is a principal forum for advice in relation to the management plan for the preservation and regeneration of plaice and sole stocks in the North Sea .
Enlargement was certainly a very important development in the Union from the point of view of foreign relations too .
What will the Commissioner do ?
These monetary policy methods are largely to blame for the latest crisis .
Commissioner Lamy is right when he tells us that it is one thing to make declarations and quite another to take decisions which affect thousands of millions of citizens .
The communication mentions the pilot project for the resettlement of refugees in Malta , but it does not introduce the notion of a pilot project concerning relocation of unauthorised migrants or asylum seekers - and this despite the repeated calls for such a burden @-@ sharing system from various Member States and Members of Parliament .
I voted in support of the report .
This would help to avoid an increase in the price of foodstuffs , and would also help to prevent famine and global warming .
In order to tackle the problem of human trafficking we need to have an overall perspective that takes into consideration all the affected policies ; that is , not just penal law but also migration .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ office of the Council , Commissioner , fellow MEPs . Our desire to create a European area of safety and justice is a common one .
They stem from an extensive reliance on big business : subsidies and tax relief for the monopolies , NATO spending , the destruction of industrial production and the mining , manufacturing , textile and ship @-@ building and repair industries , the severe undermining of agricultural production and the billions of euro for large business groups .
Too many graduates struggle to make the transition to the labour market and secure quality employment that corresponds to their educational background .
To this surplus of EUR 1.4 billion the cancelled EUR 0.2 billion of the appropriations carried over from 2006 to 2007 must be added and the negative balance of monetary exchange of EUR 0.1 billion must be subtracted , giving the 2007 surplus of EUR 1.5 billion .
However , if there is a crisis in the Schengen area , this is a subject for another debate .
Furthermore , may I quote Mr Nassauer &apos;s report , which was passed by this Parliament with a large majority : we , as the European Parliament , require that all accompanying regulations on Europol be submitted to the European Parliament for consultation before they enter the ratification procedure .
Central Asia , the majority of whose population is Turkish @-@ speaking and a small part of which is Iranian @-@ speaking , was conquered in the previous century by the Russian tsarist empire .
( Laughter ) If I do not now respond to all the questions that have been raised and the points made , please do not think that they have not been taken careful note of and will not be borne in mind in the months ahead .
I am speaking in all seriousness , and certainly not for the sake of being controversial . I know how complicated the Socialist Group made matters regarding the Customs Union , and we in the Group of the European People &apos; s Party were then always in favour of it .
Amendments 5 and 9 cannot , therefore , be approved .
This is embarrassing and utterly irresponsible , as there will never be a better opportunity , as Mr Carlgren also said .
Secondly – and I in no way intend to cause controversy here – I believe that you are confining the issue of reproductive health to abortion .
The debate is closed .
Mr Martin , it is evident that the whole House takes a great deal of interest in this matter .
A system that is applied in a number of Member States may lead to differences over how the provisions are interpreted , bringing about uncertainty for business .
Today , we have an economic and social war , rather than a military war .
This is the basic approach taken by the Consumer Rights Directive , and I therefore fully support the position of my group .
FP7 is the largest publicly funded research programme in the world and we must continue to highlight the benefits associated with it for SMEs .
The human issues should not be left to experts appointed by the Commission , who meet behind closed doors ; they must be discussed by society at large .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I fully support Mrs Ayala Sender &apos;s report , which is aimed at achieving an important objective : to extend the basic legislation on aspects of road safety to all 27 States .
Infrastructures for caring for children and the elderly are deteriorating , while trafficking in human beings , trading in women and children by international organised crime gangs , has taken on explosive proportions .
That is a major change in thinking , which I hope will be a source of future decisions connected with the European research area .
I would like to focus on one thing , even if it is not part of the neighbourhood policy .
It is all too clear who is responsible for this .
The committee addressed problems raised regarding the application of the patent system , the traditional instrument of industrial policy which favours the private funding of research , to those biotechnological and biomedical innovations that have to do with living organisms and therefore pose delicate questions of the limits between invention as a product of human activity and the discovery of living material , which cannot be appropriated .
I therefore call for a linkage between ongoing EU @-@ China bilateral dialogue on human rights and the negotiations on trade .
Mr President , I will be very brief .
Point 12 also deserves emphasis , because it calls for &quot; financing over several years &apos; which will make it possible to undertake &quot; significant actions &apos; , particularly in the field of renewable energy .
There is not even anything really new from the Council and the new President of the European Council .
The European Parliament must confirm urgently whether its support of the Commission proposal still holds and if not , identify clearly what it wants to achieve .
In this case , of course , we are not talking primarily about advance payments for arable premiums , but mainly about premiums for cattle .
The level of success in recovering unpaid debts is remarkably low .
In fact , what it really does is provide an enormous market for European businesses , in other words a new source of profits for their owners and shareholders .
We have an entirely legitimate expectation , however , that no false information is put into circulation .
In our opinion , anything we can do in the field of development policy is but a substantial part of this foreign and security policy .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , I will attempt to reply to a few of the questions .
Others - like my country , Austria - abide by the restrictions .
I would like to register a strong protest , on behalf of my group .
As the Commissioner said two days ago , the Commission is willing to allow the Member States to increase the 10 % level .
The amendment preserves the idea of priority being given them , but at the same time specifies that priority should be dependent on the number of slots requested .
Is it not time we had something like a Marshall Aid Plan , perhaps a Sarkozy Plan for Europe ?
It looks remarkably like the expansion process .
Achievement of these objectives requires that the Commission should take up an explicit position and provide for the best possible coordination among the 25 Member States .
Otherwise , without going into detail , I broadly agree with the questions asked and the remarks made by the rapporteur , which again prove the need for a detailed study and absolute transparency .
I have been lobbied by the British Local Government Association , which wants me to support proposals for much higher targets – this from an association representing local authorities that currently only collect 12 % of household waste .
I would ask him to point out to the House where the United Kingdom is in breach of its treaty obligations .
We need to put on the agenda a reduction and not an extension of working hours .
We must increase our support for Tajikistan in order to counter this activity while , at the same time , providing alternative sources of income .
They are under the control of Brussels and they are under the control of the international financial institutions .
The lawyers - and I feel I should take the opportunity to mention this as well - Michael Hausfeld and Martin Mendelson , who represent some of the governments of Eastern European countries , commented at the time that , in some respects , Austria is in fact providing more generous compensation payments than Germany , because in the first place , we are including the agricultural workers , and secondly , we are also paying compensation for children under the age of 12 and women who gave birth whilst in forced labour camps .
Mr President , my group supports Mr Cox &apos;s report and also the amendments proposed .
We must also address an issue which was avoided at first reading , and that is the question of the control of the import and export of GMO crops and other GMO products .
I should like to draw your special attention to a few points .
Since this is Commissioner Reding &apos;s first act as the Commissioner responsible for equal opportunities , however , I am more than willing to give her the benefit of the doubt .
We in Parliament have to watch over those scales and ensure that they do not tip at the expense of openness .
A secret register of wanted persons in which criminals , victims of crime and witnesses will be registered and which will include information about political views , race , sexual tendencies and religious affiliation is to be set up .
However , because of the degree of dependency , the European Union has little room for manoeuvre to influence energy supply .
That is why it is necessary to pay more attention to energy sources distributed extensively and uniformly , permitting rational and responsible use by citizens in each location , together with democratic levies and new values .
Our group gave an enthusiastic welcome to the draft Small Business Act that the Commission presented to us last June .
The Commission and a committee must not be able to obstruct the legislative work of democratically elected representatives .
The idea was mooted that financial resources should be taken away from the European programmes of the Eastern Partnership and reallocated to the South .
We hope to hold more in @-@ depth association negotiations soon , and I hope that the next Euro @-@ Latin American Summit , which will take place in Vienna next year , will lead to the creation of an inter @-@ regional strategic partnership with concrete tasks and measures .
Mr President , I am prepared to support those amendments that have just been proposed concerning Amendment No 5 , because the proposal including these changes is significantly better than the original version .
Mr President , I do not wish to add to what our rapporteur has said apart from thanking him and expressing the support of our group for his work in producing this report modifying the arrangements for complying with GATT .
Composition of committees : see Minutes
However , the practical problems relating to controls and to monitoring compliance with social rules on road transport need to be resolved .
However , the EU must continue to make an effort to bring this about , and it therefore falls to the EU and Parliament to make every effort to uphold respect for human life and affirm that decent work is the same everywhere and for everyone , and that there is a universal aspect to the meaning of environmental and social rights , including trade union rights and combating child labour .
Report ( A5 @-@ 0166 / 2002 ) by Mr Sousa Pinto , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , on the initiative of the Kingdom of Spain establishing a European Institute of Police Studies &#91; 5133 / 2002 - C5 @-@ 0055 / 2002 - 2002 / 0803 ( CNS ) &#93;
Frankly , companies in the European Union , such as Total , have blood on their hands because they are supporting this repressive regime .
3 .
This year , the EU has also taken a new initiative and developed a set of guidelines on the rights of the child which will in all likelihood be adopted by the Council at the end of this year .
A very important part of this report is the call for the promotion of volunteering through education at all levels , beginning with creating opportunities for voluntary activities at an early stage of the education system and also to promote volunteering as part of lifelong learning .
Mr President , the delegation of the Dutch Party for Freedom ( PVV ) would prefer an internal market which focuses on the core issue , that is , on the promotion of freedom and economic cooperation .
Given the accusations that Ivo Sanader attempted to influence the EU in an improper manner , I have proposed that the European Anti @-@ Fraud Office , OLAF , should work together with Croatian investigators to clarify this information because , of course , we do not know if it is true .
The April 2000 report by the Scientific , Technical Economic Committee for Fisheries reviews the status of the stocks off Morocco , as well as other countries in west Africa .
Finally , I would like to thank all those who contributed to the drafting of this report .
Surely that must give us pause for thought .
Today in Parliament we voted against supporting the German peace proposal that has been put forward .
Yesterday we were certain that everything was in order and we were ready to grant discharge , but in the course of the night we knew better .
The US investigators can no longer rely on the legal opinions concerning torture and other interrogation techniques written since 9 / 11 . This decision is important .
Within this context , following the adoption of Directive 96 / 92 / EC , that is , the first Directive on electricity , the Commission published an annual comparative evaluation report in which it examined the application of the internal market in gas and electricity in all the States of the Union .
In considering causes and solutions , the notion of inflexibility and structural reform are often bandied about .
Along with many others , I fear that we are not .
You have responded to the criticism of the media law with two arguments .
I would like your assurance that you will be developing the expert capability to what is undoubtedly going to be an increasing workload in looking at future mergers .
It is very important to lay down a clearer VAT framework and a common consolidated corporate tax base .
Lastly , with regard to relations with Turkey , I reiterate that regular meetings take place between the Council bodies and Turkey , as part of the implementation of the action plan for Iraq drawn up by the High Level Asylum and Immigration Group , as I also explained in answer to a previous question .
There were some expressions of concern that the independence of the European Anti @-@ Fraud Office ( OLAF ) might be undermined .
I would say , and this is , indeed , most significant , that the rights of freedom of the rapporteur have , in a sense , been violated in this House : when Mr Ebner mentioned his region , he called it - as is his right - Südtirol , and in the Italian translation it was adapted to the bureaucratic name fixed by the Italian centralist State and translated incorrectly , as &apos; Alto Adige &apos; .
Since you have told me that EUR 60 million has already been provided and that the first report is going to be carried out now , in April , from then on we will be very attentive to that control .
I trust that progress will be made in the negotiations with the Russian Federation on this issue .
We have work to do now and we must not waste any time .
Moreover , on no account can the European Union sanction the lack of democracy or legitimacy evident at the signing of this agreement between the American and Colombian Governments .
Commissioner , I believe that to be of the utmost important particularly for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
The symbols of the EU were enshrined within the EU Constitution - and that document was rejected in France and the Netherlands .
The problem with international institutions receiving funds from the European Union is that the EU often loses any control .
I sincerely hope that , together with Guillermo Fariñas , another Cuban laureate from 2005 , the Ladies in White - Las Damas de Blanco - will also be able to collect the Sakharov Prize in person .
The two words &apos; free and fair &apos; do not cover everything Parliament and the European Union should focus on in their election observation activities .
There is a lot that we can do , but we have to look at the situation differently .
As you are aware , ladies and gentlemen , the Member States have not yet adopted a clear stance on this issue and , needless to say , the method of financing will depend primarily on the legal form and remit of that body .
No analysis equates to justification .
Your Excellency , Mr Pöttering , President of the European Parliament , ladies and gentlemen , Members of the European Parliament , first and foremost I should like to extend my thanks to His Excellency Mr Pöttering , President of the European Parliament , and to you for giving me this opportunity to speak before this august Assembly .
Strict observance of these rights is an essential condition of our association agreement .
Besides this , the London summit produced a commitment that the G20 countries would support a new SDR ( special drawdown rights ) issue , in other words an issue in the IMF &apos;s own currency which can be used by IMF member states for mutual payments .
As soon as these discussions have been concluded , we shall of course bring forward proposals , which will also take up what Parliament has contributed to this debate .
The future visa waiver agreement must exclude any additional threats to the European Union .
This must be given a proper basis in law , and the proper place for it is in the Seventh Framework Research Programme .
So , the concept for LEADER + should retain all the positive aspects of previous programmes .
It is primarily up to those who have been given the task of leading the negotiations with Iran to dispel the citizens ’ fears , in spite of the risk – clearly a calculated risk – that Iran will not want to heed the international community ’ s legitimate demands .
They are the conversion into specific negotiation documents of political guidelines that were drawn up in December 2000 , following discussions with the other European institutions - the Council and Parliament .
The new Member States would like to join this system at the earliest opportunity .
Undoubtedly , the European Union has an important responsibility towards the phenomenon of immigration .
The analyses show that the smart use of information and communications technology ( ICT ) can reduce energy consumption in buildings , which currently account for 40 % of the total energy consumption in Europe , by up to 17 % .
These include , for example , not only the measures under the open method of coordination , but also the reversal of the burden of proof in legislation on gender equality and the latest directive based on Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities .
I want to thank the Commissioner for her very full reply .
But it also confirms how weak the critical voices have become .
Nobody can prevent it .
You know , for example , that the right to assembly which we are discussing here now is not unrestricted and absolute .
Let the Member States determine for themselves how they wish to fill their syllabuses .
I therefore believe that the Commission should offer a substantial package to Tunisia and Egypt and say that democracy is a good thing , because it also brings funding .
Good coordination at European level is an obvious requirement in this respect .
Can the Commission give an account of which Member States have forwarded their reports ?
Parliament is taking a significant step towards changing the way in which we treat animals .
The same applies to the account of the representative for the non @-@ proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the FADO programme .
So , the proposal for a decision extends from paragraph 23 onwards .
The transport projects in the TENs are a mixture of necessary infrastructure investments , especially in the southern regions , and questionable projects of prestige in regions with an already developed infrastructure .
I know that Iran is making very positive and constructive contributions to regional development ; I know this is true of Lebanon and it also seems to be the case in Iraq .
That is just not the case , the reality on the ground often does not match the aims of the legislative framework , and further urgent action is very necessary to ensure that all our citizens have access to travel .
It is very important that , when citizens reach pensionable age , they can count on a reasonable and fair pension scheme , whether they live in Finland or in Portugal .
Yesterday , on the same day , I met two major political figures : the Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs , Avigdor Lieberman , in the morning , and the President of the Palestinian National Authority , Abu Mazen , in the evening .
But specifically as a woman I would not want to see the baby thrown out with the bathwater .
The auditors even identified an amount of EUR 1.5 billion that , in their own words , should not have been paid .
In one of the measures contained in the conclusions which it issued on 6 December on maritime security and the prevention of pollution , the Council expressed its support for the ongoing work in the IMO to develop a flag state code and a compulsory model audit scheme aimed at ensuring that flag states carry out their duties under the international conventions .
For our part , we have worked hard to ensure that British Ministers have reported regularly and fully to you on the major dossiers and made every effort to take on board Parliament &apos;s views .
Preventing such a trend is a great challenge for the aircraft manufacturers .
( PT ) Only a few months ago , some were saying that the Treaty of Lisbon would never come into force .
Therefore it is academic .
This plan shows three pathways by which the European Union could cut its CO2 emissions by 80 per cent by 2050 , in line with our Kyoto aspirations .
The responsibility of the guilty should be no less than if they were drug dealers .
I shall now try to perform my duties .
Tomorrow , we shall vote upon amendments to the ERDF Regulation which are of particular importance for the so @-@ called old Member States and also for Portugal .
Yet I want value for money .
The Swedish Christian Democrats in the European Parliament &apos; s Committee on Constitutional Affairs have therefore , in the form of Amendment No 5 , pressed for the inclusion of the following sentence at the end of section 17 : &quot; The application of the subsidiarity principle , as formulated in the Treaty of Maastricht , must be evaluated . &quot;
Nonetheless , I should like to point out that until we isolate producers from distributors and introduce radical changes to the penal code to create an effective deterrent for people who make a living out of drugs , this problem will not be reduced .
Consolidation of the internal market is essential for the satisfactory economic development of the EU .
Mr President , my question is quite specific and is , I believe , of direct concern to the EU .
The compromise proposal extends the period proposed by the Commission but still accepts a reduction to the current period .
The vote will take place on Wednesday .
We have also introduced an earmarking approach which assures that the predominant share of policy resources is invested in key Lisbon drivers .
( DE ) Mr President , Baroness Ashton , ladies and gentlemen , human rights , liberty and equality are far too important for all of us to allow games to be played with them , for them to be put in the balance against powerful interests , and for commercial interests perhaps to take precedence over these values that are so important .
I am sure that in preparing this opinion Parliament will want to consider the employment issues the honourable Member raises in her question .
They have said no in view of the fact that the discussion is not yet concluded and with the forthcoming referenda in mind .
The practical response was , even then , to decide on measures which have become , in the meantime , even more relevant to the area &apos;s growth prospects .
Perhaps I may start by saying something that I think is important , namely that these negotiations must not interfere with the stability and strength of the European Central Bank , and that the attempts in various quarters to do so must be nipped in the bud .
We are now constantly being asked what progress we are making in uncovering fraud involving European funds .
With this attack , ETA has put an end to the process that was initiated by the Spanish Government and that was debated in October 2006 .
They have , with the help of experts , developed a plan for the future covering all aspects : the legal structure of the new company , technological aspects , commercial aspects , social aspects .
In conclusion , I should like to say that , here , it is really a question of civilization , of basic human values , on which the European Parliament , like the Council of Europe , has a duty to take a stand .
There are , however , institutional problems in this regard : on the one hand , the European Union &apos;s fully legitimate claim that the Member States should not legislate in areas that , at any rate , actually lie partly in its sphere of competence and belong to the internal market ; and , on the other hand , the Member States &apos; keenness to make progress .
It is now time to put them into action , together with our partners in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
This is not about the EUR 146 million .
We do not wish to call into question the need for air traffic management systems to be constantly updated and enhanced , in order to make them more reliable , more accurate and , most importantly , safer , given their importance for the safety of all those who work in and use air space .
From Rome to Maastricht it was recognised that we needed a cohesion policy geared to strengthening the less favoured regions of the Union , thus substantially pursuing the same purpose - a homogeneous common market .
The basic rule must be that people have the right to enter the EU freely , not the opposite .
That is a matter that we are going to discuss when we present the multiannual financial perspectives .
Unfortunately , so far , in the public debate on the development and consequences of new technologies , interest has focussed mainly on the economic repercussions , ignoring the analysis which examines the issues of democracy and the gender dimension , with the result that questions of technology are erroneously interpreted as ‘ neuter ’ democracy and gender .
That is the truth . It is true , however , that the Council has denied us , by various blockages , the legal basis since last November , when the Barcelona Conference took place .
In this context , the recent bilateral agreement between Turkey and Iraq on the fight against terrorism is a welcome step .
The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 6 February 2003 has been distributed .
One reason many Danes are contemplating voting &apos; No &apos; is because they feel the system is closed , bureaucratic and undemocratic .
This means - and this was an important point in our discussions - that when we say coal has a future , which the Commission has thankfully described , we must ensure that the critical aspects of coal use are addressed .
One of its purposes is to facilitate the rapid transfer of complaints to the competent body .
Commissioner , our approaches may sometimes have been different , but I believe that we have the same objective , which is to develop a beneficial modus vivendi , a way to coexist with this important eastern neighbour .
Briefly , the package which the Commission presented us with was intended to cover the three phases of how one should react to the crisis .
Deaf people often do not have the right to use and be served in their native language , which is sign language .
For example , increased traffic exhaust is the direct cause of the rise in greenhouse gases in our atmosphere .
in writing . - In Council Regulation ( EC ) 2007 / 2000 , the European Union granted exceptional unlimited duty @-@ free access to EU markets for almost all products originating in the countries and territories benefiting from the stabilisation and association process .
The targets for Romania , as regards the improvement of maternal health , are the reduction of mortality rate to 10 maternal deaths / 100,000 births by 2015 and ensuring universal access to health services .
But , today , there is still no overall statement of the European Union &apos;s position on the quality of life in the cities , even though the Green Paper on quality in the cities was debated and published 7 years ago .
The European Union supports the UN special representative and welcomes the initiatives of the UN Security Council , in particular Resolution 1460 of 30 January 2003 .
Reform of the Pact may be one of the means by which we can get out of the slowdown .
Together with my Socialist colleagues , however , I intend to continue the fight to put into action and practice that which we were unable to put in the text of the Treaty .
If you want to have a rational , environmentally responsible transport policy , you cannot cut funds that are allocated for that purpose .
Whilst some aspects of ongoing discrimination may indeed still be a problem , to suggest that more general EU legislation is somehow a solution is , in our view , way off the mark .
This is because this budget is essentially designed to enable the Council to recover the surplus balances from last year , which amount to EUR 3.2 billion .
The Commission says that the responsibility for the year 2000 computer problem lies with the suppliers and users of computer systems .
If such a state is to exist and be independent , it follows that withdrawal from the occupied territories will be necessary .
And this is where my report differs from the other two reports that are before us today , because the legal basis of the other two directives is Article 100 , and they must be adopted unanimously by the Council , with Parliament merely being consulted .
We are satisfied because , on the Kosovo Status process , on energy and also on the issue of Estonia &apos;s sovereignty , our leaders hoisted the European flag and expressed themselves strongly and intelligibly .
The work will include the preparation of EU common statements on various aspects of the Treaty for delivery by the presidency at the preparatory committee .
Natural disasters
The European Union &apos;s expectations go further , and there are clearly grounds for this , just as there are grounds for Belarus &apos; many expectations .
Question No 1 by Bernd Posselt ( H @-@ 0166 / 02 ) :
It is true that the increase in known reserves of oil in Angola points to a very interesting future for the next years and the question of licensing and who gets what gain from the large potential of oil production in Angola needs to be followed up very carefully .
No one could imagine suggesting to the United States that they should subject their anti @-@ missile defence to the authority of a WTO dispute resolution body , with rules such as national treatment , most @-@ favoured nation rules , or the obligation to award a contract to any other WTO country if it responds to an open invitation to tender in this crucial area .
This is laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights .
The phasing out of these meat subsidies and a strategy for reduced meat consumption should be self @-@ evident measures for better health in the EU .
This is particularly important , because it is not the final change , and the conduct of debates on change to that regulation will be very significant in the context of preparing an amending package linked to the crisis .
We cannot wait for an attack to take place before we act .
One that you mentioned , Commissioner , is the fact that prices for fish have gone down rather than up .
We have to find ways to implement and enforce the directive which match the needs of all labour markets .
We have not given them legal certainty .
I am sure that he will refer complaints to the appropriate committee .
( RO ) In Romania car sales fell by half by the end of 2008 .
I can further confirm to the House that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs , Mr Spring , who will be in Djakarta , will raise this matter in a very forceful way and will ensure that the views of both the General Affairs Council and this House and , indeed , the people of Europe are communicated in a strong way so that nobody is left in any doubt as to our rejection and abhorrence at what has happened in these circumstances .
I really get the impression that you have done your homework , that you have understood the issues and that the external presentation at least has been very well done .
We will again have to amend the drafts , terrible though that is as a way of going about things , because we are the ones who will have to do it and we will all be wasting time introducing this sort of amendment at a time when we should be pooling our resources .
Commissioner , each Member State has a different attitude , different traditions and a different culture when it comes to the definition of &apos; unpaid &apos; , which I feel must be wholly respected .
When it does , it will guarantee that these two countries no longer have to accept specific restrictions , can no longer be discriminated against and will have access to fishing grounds .
Mr President , this brings me to external affairs .
Madam President , I am very pleased indeed to be able to make a contribution to this debate very briefly because it is important in the times in which we live , when the Third World is suffering greatly from lack of food , to realise that we in the European Union , although facing an economic crisis , are nevertheless extremely wealthy compared with the Third World .
It must , thirdly , be clear to us that development has progressed further .
Worse still is the fact that this reality plays into the hands of extremists and fundamentalists whose goal is not peace but to continue the spiral of confrontation .
We should also remember the work of the cross @-@ border &apos; financial leaders group &apos; in bringing it about .
This is an area which the Council should in future look at with more modern eyes and adapt to the new growing labour market which demands greater flexibility .
By contrast , countries outside the EU will not be subject to the Greens &apos; Pantomime of the Ents , if you remember those characters in the Lord of the Rings .
However , Article 10 goes on to say : &apos; provided that such reimbursement &#91; ... &#93; does not give rise to exemptions other than those referred to in Article 11 &apos; .
( The President interrupted the speaker )
That is why I voted for the 2011 budget guidelines included in this report ...
Our fears are also reinforced by the traumatic experience we had last year , with 17 % participation by women in the constitutional convention for the European constitution .
In countries in which it is still not easy to complain , particularly when corruption exists , have complaint mechanisms been provided for - in particular , independent ones - so that these members of civil society can complain about poor implementation and report that they are no longer being listened to ?
Finally , I trust that the particular weight which India has at G20 will take on the characteristics of a fruitful and creative contribution to bridging the positions between the developed and the developing countries .
The Irish presidency is focusing on pragmatic cooperation with our US partners and pragmatism , rather than ideology , should inform our approach .
The first is the disappearance of exchange @-@ rate risks and the elimination of banking and foreign currency charges ; the second is peace of mind for a whole series of people , be they public servants , for example Community officials , or pensioners ; and the third is certainty for firms that - from 1 January 1999 onwards - at least 75 % of their turnover will no longer be subject to exchange @-@ rate risks , whereby they stand to gain one year or month and lose the next , because all their buying and selling will be done in a strong currency , one which will be a match for those other two strong currencies , the dollar and the yen .
It is a new means by which to organise the activities of mankind .
It does not make sense to me to transport grape must all the way across Europe to areas that already have their own supply of sugar beet .
I have heard Dutch members of this Parliament saying , in all seriousness , that we are now going to have hordes of asylum seekers coming to take our jobs , just like the Poles did , and I am not even talking about the delegation of the Dutch Freedom Party ( PVV ) .
In this context , I agree , we have to strengthen Mahmoud Abbas and his authority in order to provide stability and demonstrate that the negotiations will bring positive results .
Some of our Member States have made it very clear that they want the TFTP to continue because they have benefited from it in the past and will continue to do so .
That is all I have to say on the first aspect of the question , which in fact is similar to the question asked initially .
One of these issues is precisely this question of National Missile Defence .
For this , you must be complimented .
This will benefit a Europe that has the euro and the internal market .
If the compromise is adopted , it will be clear that we have to take the environment into account when we make decisions on additives .
The purpose behind its inclusion is starting to become clear .
The vote tomorrow will determine the future of genetically modified food in Europe .
I very much hope that Parliament will be in a position to deliver its first @-@ reading opinion on all the proposals flowing from the Commission work programme before the end of this parliamentary term .
The approach was confirmed by the Thessaloniki European Council in June 2003 .
Furthermore the record of Irish farmers in relation to animal welfare is an exemplary one .
Two weeks ago , Pascal Lamy , the WTO ’ s Secretary @-@ General , did not mince his words when he said that unless we persevere in Geneva at the end of this month , the round will end in failure .
All that a definition sanctioned by the EU will do is paint a picture of vodka as something desirable .
Instead , strategies should be defined for improving efficiency and then these same strategies should be reviewed in subsequent programmes and whatever successes or failures emerge should be examined more clearly and in depth .
the report by Marian @-@ Jean Marinescu , on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 216 / 2008 in the field of aerodromes , air traffic management and air navigation services and repealing Council Directive 2006 / 23 / EEC - C6 @-@ 0251 / 2008 - .
Fourth , equal treatment of active substances and biocidal products produced in the Community with imported products must be guaranteed .
I would like to comment on a few things which you have not really dealt with in detail .
It would , if that were adopted , raise the costs of motor insurance for consumers in many Member States .
Six months ago I called attention to the fact that the changes needed in the European Union should start with the elimination of the long @-@ standing unfair discrimination still evident against new Member States .
( The President cut the speaker off )
In all Member States parents should , for a minimum period of one year after the birth of a child , receive support at the level of their net income prior to the start of maternity leave and at the same time these arrangements should be linked into a system of pay according to which the number of years worked are taken into account when setting pay rates .
All of us that have worked with him over the years have benefited from his experience and I personally have benefited from that wonderful report he presented during the parliamentary term that began in 1989 .
It is extremely important that the civil and political rights of the Serbian minority still residing in Kosovo are fully respected .
These are small but important steps , worthy of due consideration by the Council and Parliament .
You are in character enough of a man to play the part of an outrider throughout the world .
That is why I opposed this new gimmick which , with its administrative overkill and the financial stranglehold it exerts , is in danger of placing a dark cloud over many of our businesses .
That being said , it is at least bizarre that a recommendation by the Commission has been deemed to be the right way to address the issue of CRMs , not least because , according to the Commissioner , the Commission is not yet au fait with the current state of affairs .
The technology is there .
Renationalising direct aid is appealing in some respects , but it is not an entirely satisfactory solution , because the poorest countries are precisely the ones that could least afford to assist their farmers .
The addition of vitamins , minerals , and additives to foodstuffs is often abused .
To prepare this review , the Commission intends to submit proposals building on the communication &apos; Towards a Global Partnership for Sustainable Development &apos; issued earlier this year .
I would be grateful if you could tell us , Mr Berlusconi , whether people who do not comply with that legislation will be the subject of criminal prosecution , because non @-@ compliance is an offence , and I also call on the Commission to take appropriate action if it is aware of such non @-@ compliance .
Dialogue brings us together , but it cannot always keep us together when other forces are driving us apart .
The Prespa Lakes Basin ( Prespa Park Area ) is shared between Greece , the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania .
Since then , nothing has happened , and the Commission , which has the monopoly on initiative , should also show that it deserves this right .
As far as I am aware , little was done .
Cement works , steel works and other undertakings have to cut their production .
At a time when Europe is facing a deep economic crisis whose final magnitude may be difficult to estimate , it is only to be expected that the birth rate will feel the negative repercussions of the turmoil on the labour market , as many women will tend not to have children because they are terrified of the possibility of losing their job and of the reduction in the material resources required to care for and bring up their children .
Firstly - and this will come as a surprise to many people who have a fixed idea of the committee - we took a basically positive view of the information society .
One major benefit the Commission foresees in integrating the EDF into the European budget is that there would no longer be these separate negotiations on the funding ratios for each new Fund .
The field on which the programme focuses is in itself a particularly important area in which to adopt Community measures . This is not simply because we do not have accurate statistics about the number of people suffering from rare diseases , but even more so because there is a complete lack of appropriate means - in other words resources , networks and organisations - for the identification , monitoring and effective combating of these diseases .
Under your presidency , this Parliament has seen other major advances .
We are convinced that the Commission should withdraw this proposal and revise it .
I regret that my attempts to qualify the statements of some Members and to re @-@ establish the truth did not find favour with the Committee on Women ’ s Rights and Equal Opportunities and , above all , I regret that the rapporteur repeated certain falsehoods , in particular that which would have us believe that working hours continue to be extended in the European Union when , in the majority of Member States , the opposite is true .
For years , Western Europe and America considered Kenya to be a major success story .
Economic and monetary union
Mr Valverde López is obviously an old hand at parliamentary procedures .
I therefore believe we can say that the targets set out by the Commission in its communication have been achieved on time , so far at least .
Regardless of national legal cultures and regardless of the moral censure that a particular offence might generate at national level , I am convinced that the option we should pursue at the moment is to conclude an agreement with all fifteen Member States , a substantial agreement on the list of offences to which the European arrest warrant should apply .
The Union is dismally uninspiring . Indeed , to the overwhelming number of people it is completely irrelevant .
I would like to begin my comments by saying that I welcome the Irish Peace agreement reached at the multi @-@ party talks in Belfast on Good Friday last .
I congratulate Ms Martens on her report .
The rapporteur also stresses that it is important to ensure that EU fishing vessels are obliged to possess an authorisation to fish outside European Union waters .
We wish to carry on the dialogue with Parliament and I am convinced we can reach a constructive solution .
I think that we have to turn it around and not only see it as a cost , a burden , an effort , but actually as part of the future .
( Laughter )
We therefore take very seriously the Commission ’ s expression of serious concern about continuing corruption and failure of the rule of law – areas which need urgent further action .
And finally , you can use national money in order to organise or to implement social policies in the area .
In short , employability .
A country like Iran is a challenge for both the EU and Russia .
It would be an oversight on my part if I failed to express my warm congratulations to Mr Gaubert on his report .
Perhaps I might also remind you , Commissioner , because I think you were not around at the time , that there was a lot of lobbying by the car manufacturers that these provisions were excessive , but the dealers were in favour of them .
Transparency is imperative here .
Could we not , as we did with the Cyprus issue , begin to look calmly at scenarios such as those indicated by Mr Posselt ?
( PL ) Mr President , 69 000 people died as a result of the earthquake of 12 May 2008 , over 18 000 are missing and the number of wounded is over 37 000 .
Let me express my surprise and concern about this .
Very simply the fish are not living long enough .
Volunteering also has economic value , and we must not forget this .
I was concerned to see what went on behind the scenes when the so @-@ called ‘ CIA Committee ’ was established .
The reaction of the junta was otherwise : it made sure that their protests on the streets were immediately stopped and quelled , and the murders that occurred immediately thereafter are outrageous .
It is commendable that a new article in cases where states do not have divorce laws , as in the case of Malta , has been taken into consideration .
On the ESTA , we issued a preliminary assessment which concluded that , based on the interim final rule , ESTA is not tantamount to the Schengen visa application process as defined in the European Commission &apos;s common consular instructions .
Starting from the principle that &apos; the polluter pays &apos; , we should target and tax fertiliser surpluses rather than fertiliser production .
Similarly , they must set themselves the objective of reducing by half the number of young people leaving the education system prematurely within the next five years , and of ensuring that many more young people finish their secondary education and benefit from an apprenticeship in business .
The United States , which favoured isolation at the start of the crisis , now appears to lean more towards dialogue .
You met the deputy chairman of Media @-@ Most in June , Mr Malashenko .
The second challenge is the debate on the new constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which also presents us with new challenges , and , last but not least , there is the harmonisation of the European legal area , in relation to which I will just mention the debate about the European Arrest Warrant .
Much of what the Commission may accomplish during the coming years will be determined by the initial decisions taken during this term and by our capacity to resolve difficult questions and to achieve practical results .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
There has also been a re @-@ examination of transfer policy to ensure that it is in line with international law .
in writing . - ( DE ) I have voted in favour of the Oomen @-@ Ruijten report on the Green Paper on pension systems .
My main aim , with my vote , was to prioritise support for the European recovery plan , for the launch of a new initiative on micro @-@ credit ( EUR 25 million in 2010 ) and for emergency aid for the milk sector ( EUR 300 million ) .
The European Parliament &apos;s new powers - giving it , for example , influence over the agricultural budget and over legal policy - will mean adjusting some of its priorities to cope with the new responsibilities .
We have played safe by falling back into the comfort zone of either past imperialistic ideals or post @-@ fascist commands or even , dare I say it , new 20th @-@ century thinking with regard to human life and human rights .
They have gorged themselves by charging a high price for a risk taken on the Greek debt that you have just done away with by adopting the latest measures .
Let us work together - Parliament , the Commission and the Council - to accomplish this task .
This is , in principle , a localised problem which should , as such , be solved by the competent authority of the relevant airport .
If it is true , as it is true , for example , that Community regulations must comply with their primary legal source - that is , the Treaty - , I do not understand why the proposals for regulations on the reform of the Structural Funds , presented by the Commission on 18 March , do not refer to any insertion of that aspect of insularity which concerns 14 million European citizens .
The fairness of the election should be verified by independent external observers - otherwise the election will be pointless .
It is a report that has been drawn up in accordance with the normal procedures of our House and , in recognition of the electoral sensitivities of some , the rapporteur has offered to delete Mr Berlusconi &apos;s name from the report .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to thank Mr Costa for a constructive report .
I think that we must - and the Commission , with a considerable presence in Georgia , has the means to do so - send a clear message to Abkhazia , saying to it that to want everything is to find oneself deprived of everything .
In fact , it is by developing links with one another , on the one hand , and links with the rest of the world , on the other , that our universities will improve the quality of the service they provide .
For all that , the very nature of the Burmese regime makes the Burmese population highly vulnerable to poverty and disease .
The second issue concerning which we can see room for improvement is the strengthening of the European voice .
We are well aware that the assurances we enjoyed in the past cannot be guaranteed for the future , and we have to be ready to form a society that is still able to prosper in circumstances that are no longer the same as in the present or past .
We must break away from the logic of quantity and instead pursue quality production - excellence - in a way that celebrates the specific national , regional and local characteristics of European wine @-@ growing .
Apart from the fact that no one other than the rapporteur in the debate can discuss the topic in plenary , it even deprives the rapporteur of the possibility of discussing individual amending proposals which are problematic in the report .
In fact , the report seems to me to be incomplete .
Help is indicated here .
To Mr Suominen I wish to say that we are maintaining close contact with Lithuania and Russia .
Parliament clearly recognises the importance of these activities and therefore calls for an instrument which would enable the European Union to finance such actions from sources other than the DCI .
I also thank Commissioner Malmström for the enthusiasm she has shown for the concept of burden sharing , which should influence her work within the Commission and thus within Council .
In some cases , these offences are merely administrative , whereas in others they are criminal offences .
Muslims may use the Danish courts in the same way as all other citizens .
In principle , the idea may be included within the framework of our scientific and technological cooperation , but we will need to know more details about the nature of the Russian proposals .
Secondly , we propose a simplified system for the fishing effort , where we want to operate the effort not for each individual ship but for a group of ships .
Vocational training is viewed here as a means of promoting &apos; entrepreneurship &apos; and of responding to the need to &apos; create an environment where enterprises can succeed , develop and grow &apos; , adding that &apos; to grow , they need a reduced tax burden and predictability so they can plan and make investments &apos; .
The uncertain relations that prevail in the Ukrainian administration of justice mean that it can take many years for property to be recovered .
I would therefore like to appeal to the Commission to take competitiveness principles into account , to a greater extent than before , when implementing the necessary reforms in the sugar industry , and to pay much more attention to the development of the biofuels sector .
The problem will not go away .
.
This requires support not only from Parliament , which has a clear position here across all parliamentary groups .
Europe has not been deadlocked .
In any event , the honourable Member &apos;s initiative is always good .
European Network and Information Security Agency (
Our frontier workers will also benefit from this , although no such insurance exists either in Belgium or in France .
It is critical that their voice is heard and I hope the Commission will ensure that Parliament and the Fisheries Committee are kept informed of the progress of this inquiry , especially as the estimated level of dumping by Chile is 29.7 % , in direct contravention of fair trade .
Let a show a good example in Buenos Aires .
Mr President , torture is always wrong and counterproductive .
The Bureau considered a proposal from the Secretary General , without us knowing whether ...
The Commission wrote to Ministers for Agriculture on 4 January and asked for replies to an extensive questionnaire on the implementation of BSE @-@ related measures .
– Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I must confess that I am at a loss , and I do not think that I am the only one .
For a couple of centuries in their new homelands , emigrants from Europe have produced foodstuffs and drink whose traditions they have brought with them from their countries of origin .
He rightly refers to the European social model , and we believe that this European social model is , in reality , deeply incompatible with the doctrines of globalism which now govern the world economy .
So when our fishing grounds in Community waters cannot supply the catches required by the capacity of the European fishing fleet , we must look for alternatives in waters of other third countries .
I would like this House to support Mrs Attwooll &apos;s amendments , which go some way towards improving the report , and my group will definitely be voting for these amendments .
To conclude , I am delighted that this report and its underlying principles have received such widespread support in the European Parliament .
We have already seen what happens when you allow people from poor countries to have freedom of movement into richer ones .
We spend hours in the European corridors of power talking about unemployment but why do we ignore tourism as an obvious job generator ?
Then I bought a taxi , then a public transport firm and then an airline , and then I became the owner of a satellite network . &quot;
This EUR 1 billion facility is now being discussed here in Parliament , and I hope that there will be a positive approach to this possibility of helping developing countries feed their own people and avoid migration from rural areas to the cities .
I liked the expression you used , Mr President , concerning the conflict between Russia and Georgia .
More than anything , if Europe means being afflicted with new burdens , heavy taxation or economic and financial alchemy , they do not want to be part of it. it is true that structural reforms are needed to achieve a single currency , but they must preserve solidarity with the weakest citizen .
As for your suggestion , I can only speak personally , but I must say that the idea of a &apos; Europe Day &apos; celebrated across Europe seems to me effectively to be a symbol of more shared citizenship , of a Europe that is better understood .
Certain scientists believe major climate changes are a natural cyclical phenomenon that has affected the world for millions of years .
This is exactly why we have introduced such a process in the Lamfalussy procedure , which we developed recently .
This House is now right to conclude that the Commission , with its recommendation of 18 October 2005 on &apos; collective cross @-@ border management of copyright and related rights for legitimate online music services &apos; has gone too far .
The reality is quite simple .
Secondly , because there is a power split where economic policy is concerned between a central bank which is entirely unaccountable and not subject to any democratic scrutiny on the one hand and the governments on the other .
If that is the official record - and that is the record that is published - then I would suggest that the result given by the President this morning is incorrect .
This is not always the case at the moment .
As the European Parliament rapporteur on the evaluation of this Directive , I must say that the concrete application of the right of free movement for our citizens is seriously undermined by Member States which erect dams in breach of the Treaties and of the Directive .
I want to draw attention to these problems again to show that I am very much aware of them .
By introducing emergency autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan , the European Commission is bringing the narrow commercial interests of a few - business , pure and simple - into the field of humanitarian aid .
This is strange for a Commission that claims to be so fond of its right of initiative .
In future , we should even extend our thinking to include foreign policy and police and judicial cooperation .
However , in Romania , there are more families wishing to adopt than children available for adoption .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Schmitt is indeed right to say that today marks the first anniversary of the calamity at Überlingen , when two aircraft collided , resulting in many deaths .
author . - ( PT ) As underlined in our Group &apos;s motion for a resolution , it is currently vital to express our solidarity with the East Timorese people and to condemn the attacks on the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister of East Timor .
Once the players are sold , will consumers be hit by technical restrictions and technical obstacles when they want to use the products , music and films they have bought ?
The Integrated Security in Europe conference which was held in November gave rise to a debate on stricter control of the sector .
The list of violations carried out within the European Union by the states and institutions is a long one : xenophobia , double punishment , arbitrary detention , discriminatory practices as regards hiring and housing , and offences based on identity .
I believe that increasing women &apos;s professional activity is an important issue .
.
That means changing our approach to the whole cycle of goods &apos; production in an effort to prevent the creation of waste and thus obtain materials that are useable or recyclable .
The Commission must therefore be capable of achieving the highest standards of executive and administrative performance in the discharge of its powers and duties in order to facilitate that massive and welcome development .
Mr President , Mr Vice @-@ President , it needs to be said loud and clear that this House was right to appeal against the agreement on the personal data of flight passengers ; the European Court of Justice has already ruled that the legal basis on which it reposed was false , and it is only regrettable that it has not therefore had anything to say about its substance .
If it is open in its dealings with the markets and transparent in its decision @-@ making , the foundations for a successful European Central Bank will have been laid .
I am very sorry about that .
For this reason , all mines should be banned .
It simply enables us to create healthy , viable conditions for the internal market , in line with the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy .
However , it would be well received by farms whose owners are close to retirement age , who would see that it was possible to receive aid by reducing activity to a minimum .
We have also encouraged them to participate in the EGGC expert group which was set up by the Committee of the Regions .
It was indeed a very great tragedy that struck Portugal , as you said .
The same issue arose with Siemens , which applied the same practice and corrupted the governments of thirty countries in a bid to win contracts from public corporations , a scandal which is still rocking Greece .
I hope you share our view that this is the right way to render the provisions of the draft directive even more effective in practice .
We must not resist new ideas such as the strategy of helping the climate to recover through the medium of water .
Local agriculture has been hard hit , as a result of which the country has become too dependent on food imports .
After all , what is it that we constantly hear , not only during election campaigns but also in the interim ?
Only then , I believe , will we have sufficient guarantees in place to create an internal market for services that function well while fully respecting the social ground rules .
According to the Commission , less than 1 % of the EU budget is currently spent directly on innovation @-@ related measures .
We consider the budget appropriation to be inadequate , given the needs that exist .
It is important not to create confusion among the general public as regards the nature of the Community institutions .
Having said that , however , you will have to agree with me that in the short term it is not possible to alter reality and that the main victim of the results of this situation is a sector such as transport , which is overly dependent on the evolution of demand and is at the mercy of fluctuations in oil prices .
Here the Commission is on the point of gambling away the substantial amount of trust which has been built up .
We have to find a solution for these people as soon as possible because their isolation and frustration will understandably increase .
I would like to say a few words on each .
Nowadays , we can no longer make peace by waging war .
I want to congratulate Mrs Hautala who has worked to find a new way of solving the problems entailed in the EU &apos; s out @-@ of @-@ date Directive on Equal Treatment .
I therefore support the Commission &apos;s approach , which aims to improve the procedures at first instance - &apos; front @-@ loading &apos; - because high quality decisions at first instance will be particularly beneficial for victims of persecution insofar as they will enable the competent authorities to deliver robust decisions , improve the defendability of negative decisions , and thus reduce the risk of them being overturned by appeal bodies , better identify cases of unfounded or abusive applications , and reduce reception and procedural costs in the Member States , while supporting their efforts to expel asylum seekers whose applications have genuinely been rejected .
( Applause )
By the end of this year the Commission will produce a report analysing the situation in the energy market , which will be prepared in conjunction with the competition authorities .
Many businesses in the tourism industry are small and medium @-@ sized enterprises and would already benefit from regulations for this category .
The next item is the report ( A4 @-@ 0468 / 98 ) by Mrs Schaffner , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs , on respect for human rights in the European Union ( 1997 ) .
We can of course turn round and say that we want all data from now on to have a sound scientific basis , which is what everyone wants , but this legislation will not give it to us , and that is why it is not actually a very good idea that we should adopt it in its present form , and it was not well @-@ advised of the Commission and the Council to submit exactly the same proposal , for a second time , at second reading , for it was Parliament ’ s first response after first reading that was the basis for further discussion that would achieve our objective .
Well , he is wrong about that .
Following on from the stubborn refusal to put the subject on the agenda at the intergovernmental conference , which would allow account to be taken of the tragic repercussions for the peoples of the Union and for the economies of the weakest countries and make it possible for things other than the infamous nominal criteria to be taken into consideration as conditions for the adoption of the single currency , the European Union is setting the stage for a lengthy period of austerity and budgetary belt @-@ tightening via the German @-@ inspired stability pact .
This aspect is left out of the motion for a resolution .
Only a stable , legitimate government will be able to successfully complete the reforms that are necessary to improve the situation of Kyrgyz citizens .
Therefore , I congratulate you .
I believe there must be a balance between competitiveness , social Europe and the environment , but we must be aware that if we do not have competitiveness , if we do not generate wealth in a globalised world , it will be difficult for us to respond to the requirements of a social Europe or to environmental concerns .
There are a number of key issues which I have raised which must be on that agenda .
These include definitions of what constitutes a measure to protect public health and is , therefore , subject to the compulsory licensing requirements allowed under TRIPS .
The report on the reduction of CO2 emissions from light vehicles has added an important detail : the fight against climate change .
These countries are in the process of taking measures in preparation of free access of alcoholic products in the year 2003 .
In my country , where the energy market is controlled by public suppliers for the public good , anything like this will have very unfavourable consequences .
The gradual liberalisation of the water , energy and transport sectors , monitored directly by the Commission or , upon request , by the individual States , will allow the second directive to expire without making it necessary to amend the first directive .
Although market regulation mechanisms are needed to balance supply and demand , the Commission is not justified in extending the ban on new planting up to 2010 while permitting wine making from imported musts .
We are currently finding out how much we are affected when the opposite happens .
I would also like to take the opportunity to remind you that on Wednesday at 12.00 , a ceremony will be held to present the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , negotiations on a common European asylum policy are proving to be tough and difficult .
The Group of the Union for a Europe of Nations also expects from the Italian Presidency policies seeking to combat forms of discrimination , to crack down on traffickers of arms and human beings and to destroy the arcane , yet powerful world of child abuse .
In our conclusion we discovered that there is scepticism about the result of the presidential election .
The contribution of &apos; Youth on the Move &apos; to the debate on the definition of a European cultural model is no less important .
I believe and expect that the European Council will send out a clear message to the effect that the other Member States should also be able to express their views on the European Constitutional Treaty .
I congratulate the EIB on its successful activities and ambitious business plan .
In our view , no special budget can be created for fines to be paid into ; if fines are paid , they must go into the budget of the European Community .
The Commission fully supports the principle of Amendment 6 concerning monitoring by the social partners and involving and consulting them .
So I am all for social justice and social inclusion , but the biggest enemy of both is unemployment .
Clinical trials
Unfortunately , that was not successful , despite every effort on the part of the shadow rapporteurs , and for this I should like to thank them nevertheless .
This means that we must state clearly to what extent we wish to have migration into Europe and to what extent we do not .
Lastly , I voted in favour of rape and sexual violence being considered a crime , even within marriage or any other type of intimate relationship .
Our immunity is in fact a shield which protects us : we can accuse , insult , and do whatever we like , but that , of course , is contrary to political ethics .
I would like to see the Member States reward business for good health and safety with tax rebates and a preference in calls for tenders and the introduction of a bonus @-@ malus system in insurance policies , as well as other financial incentives .
Somebody said earlier that we have done little .
We are all aware of the special sensitivity of this issue and we have all made an effort to achieve it .
However , one should remember the background for the proposal .
Gathering statistical information for smaller territories is certainly more difficult , but in fact 95 % of the European island population , outermost regions excluded , live in NUTS II or NUTS III regions .
Mr President , I consider that Turkey has to begin making the necessary steps to be acceptable to join the EU .
With many speakers , I can do no other than agree .
We cannot , however , rest on these laurels .
I should like to refer to a specific case as a means of illustrating that the sharing of information is not enough .
Good @-@ quality , effective and simple legislation in the internal market should open up opportunities for cross @-@ border trade and give consumers increased choice , while protecting environmental , social and consumer rights .
A change in the definition would obscure the situation and lead to unnecessary legal uncertainty .
How China is to solve these problems fairly is of course an internal matter but I agree with the rapporteur that in the longer term programmes jointly implemented in cooperation with the EU , Japan and the United States of America will be desirable to solve the employment and social problems of the country &apos;s vast rural area .
The experiences of these last few months and the prospects for the future are in line with the interinstitutional agreement on ‘ Better Law @-@ Making ’ and fully confirm my optimism .
This is why it is so important for the European Union to seek joint responses .
. ( DE ) Closer European cultural cooperation is a welcome and desirable aim .
( The Minutes were approved )
Firstly , in a debate about our cooperation with Israel , in which human rights and the humanitarian problems of the Palestinians are rightly discussed , it should not , however , be forgotten that we have a particular responsibility towards Israel .
Fourthly , this is about an emancipatory labour market policy .
Will any of this be taken into consideration in your impact assessments ?
So it is not the EU approval process that is the great problem , as the industry would have us believe .
We cannot cleverly sidestep it .
We bear ever greater responsibility for each other in global terms .
In the individual Member States , several models exist for the coordination of these activities , and it is currently difficult to claim that a particular country &apos;s solution should serve as a model for others .
Mr President , I would like to thank you for this debate .
Later he proposed independence for Kosovo .
After a surge of optimism last year , North Korea &apos; s apparent process of opening up towards the outside world and developing relations with its southern neighbours has entered a period of stagnation .
The Commission and the Council need to seriously address the request for India for EUR 1 billion each for health and education , recognising that one of our main priorities is the Millennium Development Goals and India makes up 40 % of the MDGs .
However , we believe that the Council weakened the text and so I would like to call on colleagues to support the amendments which were adopted in committee to improve the common position .
However , it is true that a Europe that is stagnating economically on account of its own economic and monetary policies cannot afford to dismiss the thousands of billions of euros of potential investment that they represent .
We do object , on the other hand , if in such a system the current large wage differences existing between EU Member States are abused to reduce labour costs .
Many Members here are being invited , as I am , to conferences , some organized by presidents @-@ in @-@ office , full of experienced rational experts who want a European contribution to international problems which cannot be properly tackled at local or national levels .
In other words , people are either revolted or completely depressed by them .
It must not be for the European Parliament to establish what constitute crimes , mitigating circumstances and degrees of culpability .
It is in the interests of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises to stand by the ELISE programme , and when we see the Council &apos;s difficulty in bringing itself to approve this initiative , we have to conclude that the Member States - in particular , my own country - are systematically blocking the decision in the Council .
I have had a little to do with this too .
Agriculture is too fragmented and weak as a sector to set up its own insurance schemes .
The report highlights the extent to which the situation in the Central and Eastern European candidate countries ( CEECs ) has deteriorated during the &apos; painful readjustment process of CEECs &apos; .
The focus of attention in recent months on the number one issue - the early @-@ warning mechanism - has meant that several important measures that strengthen the quality and coverage of EU budgetary surveillance have been somewhat overlooked .
Drivers , things have to change in Europe in terms of driving times and rest periods , and so proof is required .
In the case of the Commission , on the basis of the resources agreement of 2001 and annual resources protocols , 12 so @-@ called secondment posts are granted to the trade unions on a permanent basis out of a total of more than 23 000 posts at the Commission .
It was also one of our conditions for Russia &apos;s WTO accession .
– Mr President , the results of the recent elections in Israel basically legalised the strategy of the unilateral imposition of the terms of any resolution to the Palestine problem .
Because of a misunderstanding that request was not made in time .
It is true that an important contribution was also made to this text by the Council , which , faced with the immense commitment of the Italian Presidency that has just come to an end , effectively followed the text ’ s progress and intervened at once , just when it seemed that the common position , which was aimed precisely at opening a second reading , would be delayed ; nor do I want to forget the commitment and interest shown by the Irish Government delegation long before it assumed the current Presidency , thus showing a real desire to best define the text in question .
The first is related to the ambiguity surrounding the coordinator on anti @-@ terrorism and illicit trafficking in persons and the extent to which this official is dependent on the Commission and , conversely , subject to control by the European Parliament .
For this reason a strategic approach to the fight against terrorism is necessary and , indeed , crucial to guarantee the survival of Europe , its peoples and its cultures .
. I can understand the intent of the supplementary question put by the honourable Member .
We hear a lot said about solidarity .
In the battle against climate change , emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases must be reduced as much as possible .
&lt; empty &gt;
No account whatever is taken of interactions between different pesticides .
A new Multiannual Financial Framework ( MFF ) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe ( continuation of debate )
Regardless of the outcome of the elections , a clearly defined programme is required .
Twenty years after you won back your ability to govern yourselves democratically , you are now part of a new political union that increasingly shows similarities with that old Soviet Union .
Madam President , I rise following Mrs Hautala &apos;s statement about Mrs Lucas being imprisoned on her way to the part @-@ session here today .
In much the same way as the German transport ministry , the Commission has allowed itself to be pressed into the service of two big players and wants to force upon us satellite technology that is not yet fully developed .
All decisions should be made on the basis of scientific evidence , but also following risk assessment , at Community level .
Let me briefly list the areas to which the Commission referred : the need to strengthen the independence of the judiciary and improve their working practices , the need for an overall framework for the exercise of fundamental rights , which must be clarified in such a way that every relic of the authoritarianism inherited from the past is done away with .
Of course , even a single venue involves a cost .
These measures must not only ensure that jobs are preserved in this sector but also prevent Europe from becoming dependent on other countries .
Regarding Amendment No 46
This should therefore be corrected : 76 instead of 69 .
Darfur is mentioned often but rarely given any real meat , and the African summit provides us with another opportunity to try to bring together the disparate parts and elements in the conflict to ensure we can find a clear way forward .
I live with diabetes .
But we as Austrians are having to learn the hard way in the European Union that things do not always go the way we want .
So for many of us this is an interesting learning experience .
Article 18 of law 2936 / 2001 makes provision for a reduction in unarmed or civilian service for recognised conscientious objectors , who will complete reduced armed service .
This clearly shows that the risks which our population faces as a result of the manufacture of chemical and biological weapons are insufficiently removed by current legislation .
I am pleased that our own legal services - who say Parliament must be very wary of attempts from representatives of other institutions to limit our powers - have confirmed that there is nothing in the rules to stop us having a parliamentary inquiry , so long as the terms of reference differ from any question before the courts in a Member State .
The disadvantages of the new agreement are an increase in the contribution to be paid by shipowners , a lower level of profitability for the EU than other tuna fisheries agreements and the same financial support from the EU in return for lower catch quotas .
It is commendable that international institutions such as the UN , the Council of Europe and the European Union , are addressing this modern form of slavery belonging to the 20th and 21st centuries .
The surge in questions has at the same time meant a real challenge : almost 25 % of the total number of written questions have been put by no more than eight Members of Parliament .
The Council is also under pressure from the national parliaments , which categorically reject any increase in the ceiling on own resources .
There are difficulties with other figures : there are difficulties with the quarterly financial account figures in the national accounts , with the unemployment figures at this time of the enquiry into the German workforce and with the French figures , but that is everyday statistical work , and if Parliament wants to give Eurostat more resources , they will be welcome .
These are matters which , if ignored , will prevent you from properly managing the reconstruction process , which will be long and difficult but also potentially very worthwhile .
The requirement concerning the termination of unauthorised releases also clarifies the need for a consistent response .
One aspect that concerns me is the partial decoupling of aid ; the haste to move forward in decoupling aid may endanger many crops .
This draft budget focuses mainly on rental arrangements and renovation solutions for the places of work of the institutions .
I agree that we need more time to evaluate the impact of some additional labelling requirements , especially regarding origin , the care treatment method and the introduction of a harmonised size labelling system .
The EU must be equal to the task of moving forward , reaching a satisfactory agreement among its Member States and playing a leading role at the WTO .
Although there is no doubt that some progress has been made , the fact is that some questions still remain unanswered .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - ( PT ) The debate on the changes to the Statute of the Ombudsman in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs was not easy .
This is not the way to restore people &apos;s trust .
Indications that these two countries are sponsors of international terrorism are increasingly clear .
Social cohesion means all three , it means fighting poverty , inequality and exclusion .
I would urge you to keep up the good work , for much remains to be done .
Mr President , I asked a series of questions of the Commissioner .
I have the greatest respect for the Commission , for the Commissioners and for the 15 000 officials who work under them .
Mr President , the Cairo Summit has been genuinely significant , an historic milestone .
The EU and the United States share the same basic values of freedom , democracy , human rights and the principles of a state based on the Rule of Law .
I would say , philosophically as it were , that this is actually a point worth considering .
A judge who asks a foreign colleague for proof of criminal acts does not receive replies in more than 10 % of cases .
We have already increased the budget for energy in the seventh Framework Programme by 50 % and for the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme by 100 % .
The European Parliament believes that , to be eligible for subsidy at European level , financed by taxation , a party association must have obtained at least five per cent of the vote in at least a third of the Member States or be represented in the European Parliament or national or regional parliaments in a third of the Member States .
In the run @-@ up to the elections , there is a website in the Netherlands entitled ‘ geenwoorden.nl ’ .
That is part of the budget @-@ making procedure .
At first sight , the title &apos; harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport &apos; does not appear to have any relevance for agriculture policy .
I believe that this is one of the most important elements to have been introduced .
On the second point , I would recall that the present four @-@ category classification has been preserved , out of respect for the already @-@ mentioned cultural and traditional practices , with a reassessment of the advantages and drawbacks of perhaps cutting back to just two categories to be carried out by 2012 .
Mr President , a question such as that cannot be answered in general terms . If , however , something along the lines of an answer is desired , it can often be a good idea to ask the democratic forces in the country concerned .
The Ad Hoc Committee is made up of experts on BSE .
We do not need that .
.
I would like to point out several inconsistencies : as a doctor and a teacher , I am aware of the range of reports presented each year by the World Health Organisation , which always cite the famous Horowitz vicious circle , according to which illness creates poverty and poverty creates illness .
Can you confirm these figures ?
information for the consumer on goods bought by him / her ; good information is the best consumer protection ,
Competition is exactly what ensures consumers receive not only low prices but also optimum quality .
On behalf of my group , I would like to express my very deep regret about the way in which Christians are being treated in Iraq .
I will be honest , Commissioner , and concede that I did not at first think it possible that the Convention would indeed bring itself to make Europol subject to a codecision procedure , to be termed in future a legislative procedure , with equal rights for Parliament and for the Council , but what I asked for at the end of each of my previous speeches has now been granted .
Indeed , despite the Commission &apos;s efforts and the support from this House , the selfishness and short @-@ sightedness of certain Member States - more concerned to protect narrow farming interests than to develop a broad @-@ based vision of international economic and hence political relations - are preventing the launch of initiatives which could have extremely important repercussions , primarily for Latin America but also for Europe .
Where is the framework directive about food , food control , hygiene and other aspects ?
People clearly seem to find it hard to distinguish between Islam and Islamic fundamentalism , and this is precisely what we need to guard against .
As part of the overall review of its management , which is also being carried out within the Commission , we believe that , at a time when European integration is increasingly coming under attack , the European Union should at least make itself visible in its external information policy .
The instruments adopted within the International Maritime Organisation only apply to ships engaged in international trade and to facilities at the ports they use .
Prosperity in Europe also depends on achieving an effective and open single market and pursuing the aims of the Lisbon strategy .
In the last instance , I would also like to underline how important it is that at least the parties involved , i.e. the consumer and entrepreneur , must always be able to make prior arrangements regarding the applicable legal system .
The Commission should reply to Parliament ’ s question as to whether the UK properly applied the Non @-@ Life Insurance Directive between 1978 and 2001 .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the forthcoming enlargement which is the subject of our debate today naturally poses a unique challenge to the European Union .
Unfortunately , however , we often applaud the notion of competitivity , while supporting initiatives which erode that very competitivity .
2 .
In my view , this means introducing a quasi @-@ constitutional process , as a result of which a unified Europe is established by the will of its people .
Most immediately , I want to ensure that the EU &apos;s meeting with President Obama in Prague on 5 April takes the relationship forward in a tangible way , already focusing on concrete results .
We looked at ways to cover the following important areas : the nature of voluntary work and administrative , financial , linguistic and cultural obstacles to mobility .
Madam President , this is the first in a series of directives that have to complete the first part of the timetable which aims to introduce , in the longer term , a common asylum procedure and a uniform status for people who are granted asylum .
Freedom with responsibility ought to be the motto for continued work on developing this area .
Although I am happy with the Commission ’ s proposals , there is a great deal left to be done ; not only as regards doctors , but also as regards firefighters – and I could say the same of a number of other services .
This behaviour deserves democratic protest .
We all agree on the importance of the overall economic situation .
This can lead to very important progress , and I have mentioned several concrete examples of this in my speech .
Countries need long @-@ term predictable aid from external donors .
In particular , we think it is right that with effect from next year - I am assuming that it will come into effect next year - passengers who are unable to travel due to overbooking , despite the fact that they have valid and confirmed tickets , will receive increased compensation of ECU 185 on flights up to 3 500 km and ECU 379 on flights over 3 500 km .
Since 9 / 11 there has been a tightening up on corruption , but it is still not treated with the same seriousness as terrorism or drugs .
When the problem first came to light in December , my departments immediately initiated a procedure , contacting the &quot; accused &apos; by means of letters . There were also the reactions of some Members of Parliament .
When I travel around the Member States and talk to farmers , they ask for predictability .
Now I know it is partly at the Commissioner &apos;s responsibility , but will he , in pushing forward the ratification of the Community part of the 1996 Convention , also make it clear to Member States that it makes sense for them to ratify the rest of that Convention at the same time so that there is no disparity between the Convention and the way it is applied in different Member States within the Community .
This also applies to the accession states .
This report gives us an excellent analysis of the current state of aquaculture in the European Union and also provides us with important guidelines for the future .
There is still time to respond by asking the Commission to try to come up with something better regarding waste management , both by proposing that waste be stored underground within the power stations and , above all , by putting in place new , demanding standards where nuclear safety is concerned .
I do not understand why environmentally friendly rail travel is constantly being put at a disadvantage .
Finally , he has emphasised the importance in this regard of the role of politics : of political circles and institutions .
The serious human rights violations by Israel in Jenin and at many other locations in the reoccupied territories are tantamount to a cancellation of the Association Agreement by Israel itself , since respecting human rights forms part of the very substance of this Association Agreement .
Then , also with subsidiarity in mind , I would prefer the next steps to be taken in directives and only enact in regulations what is really necessary to do uniformly .
This is only possible if there is a clear focus on innovation , flexible working and new models for work , and training for young people in an increasingly competitive market .
The proposal referred to in the question , an annual report , may be one way but the Council will have to return to that question with more concrete information at a later date .
If I may , I will now return to the actual reason for my being here , the discharge for 1997 .
Firstly , the problem of representation and the representativeness of the organisations concerned .
New instruments must be found in the short and medium terms , for combating speculation in particular ; in fact , the Commissioner has just said that that is the crux of the problem .
A hundred years ago the population of Europe represented 15 % of the world &apos;s population .
Suggesting now that the process should go on , devising clever ways of regenerating Lisbon in open defiance of public will , is an arrogance of breathtaking proportions and we have seen it all before .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 : 00 .
A similar situation has arisen with regard to milk quotas for which the limits set by the European Commission are also less than domestic consumption .
This is a serious situation , but there is hope .
That , too , is something we must not lose sight of .
I have listened to all of this debate with increasing sadness at the way in which the impressive , ambitious rhetoric of the UK Presidency is just not matched by reality .
Subject : Excise duties
What is going on in Lebanon ?
For this reason we have asked for a roll @-@ call vote on Amendment 30 to confirm support for this key objective .
I am afraid that would have to be decided before we take the vote this evening .
It says &apos; and &apos; and not &apos; or &apos; in the article but , in actual fact , only members representing interests were appointed .
What is particularly serious , is that this flaw is now written into the Treaty of Amsterdam .
We cannot therefore support any amendment aimed at blurring or doing away with the distinction established so clearly in the Council &apos; s text .
Thirdly , it seems to me important that the Commission should play a role in resisting the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the Commission , in order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies .
We should not , however , remove workers ’ right to choose for themselves whether or not they want to work longer hours .
Financial support to Member States ( motions for resolutions tabled ) : see Minutes
With increasing energy prices and a lack of competition in national markets , there is a danger of increasing the number of citizens excluded from accessing energy .
I have had my doubts since the start and have criticised the system of bilateral loans , but that does not mean that I do not hope that it works and stops speculation against the euro .
Madam President , once again we have to pass a resolution on Kenya - as we did last July - and we have to do so because the Nairobi military authorities continue to promote tension in that country .
Are we facing chronic pollution , which will last for years , or is a solution emerging ?
I would remind you , by the way , that one of the reasons why we started this debate on the liberalisation of energy markets at the beginning of the 1990s was that prices in Europe were very high , so that it was not only the companies , but also we ourselves , who were complaining that we were at a competitive disadvantage against the USA , our main competitor .
This should be accompanied by due recognition of researchers as a separate professional category , for we need researchers , we need to train good researchers , we need to keep our researchers and bring back those who have left Europe , and we even need to invite those from other countries who wish to join us .
It works for us .
Can we ask you as President to make sure that is happening with the taxpayers &apos; money for which we are collectively responsible .
Is the rate of gas and oil supply the measure of our objectiveness ?
With this in mind , we agree with the proposal that a representative sample of the vessels to which each Member State has issued a special fishing permit should take a scientific observer on board , ensuring a suitable rotation among all vessels for successive fishing trips .
Clearly , the success of the Doha Development Round is crucial to a further liberalisation of world trade .
As you may well imagine , I will not be voting for it except probably for the first amendment from Mr Rosado Fernandes which says &apos; whereas the Commission has taken no account whatsoever of the European Parliament &apos;s opinion of 17 July 1997 &apos; .
Just how important this is can be seen from the fact that cheap labour can be found on building sites all over Europe and it even jeopardises safety , as shown by the example of the Finnish nuclear plant , where safety standards were not met by subcontractors .
Mr President , slowly and all too belatedly , a common European security policy is in the process of taking shape , one which , though it leaves a bad taste in the mouth to say so , is , at it were , being built on the ruins of Kosovo .
Over this period , it has been demonstrated that the European Union system works , and works well .
Therefore , media concentration jeopardises freedom of conscience and is a grave injury to human dignity .
in writing . - I voted for this report which is driven by the European Union &apos;s policy commitment to simplify the legislation in force with a view to creating a better and clearer legislative environment for businesses , mainly with respect to the simplification of customs formalities carried out by importers of certain textile products released for free circulation in the EU .
Only a few sections of society would benefit from this and it would spell disaster for agricultural communities .
Renewable energy is the key plank of the solution .
Why not when the highway code recommends that car drivers should take a break every two hours ?
( DE ) Mr President , Mr Tannock referred to the Iranian ships that passed through the Suez Canal .
Therefore , I move for the creation of a European health insurance scheme , recognised by all Member States , facilitating European cooperation in the field of crossborder healthcare .
This should be the focus of our authorisation process .
Freedom , and consequently democracy , are after all also under threat here following the adoption of a proposal for the mandatory retention of telephone calls , text messages and emails for the police .
The pressures on the environment have worsened and poverty continues to win ground in the world .
That is why the guarantee fund was implemented , allowing us to confront these difficulties in the event of non @-@ payments .
In order to improve the flexibility of the labour market , we will certainly have to remove the remaining obstacles , adopt the recognition of professional qualifications and establish business incentives linked to productivity .
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
We believe that the Council discharge should be approved .
I think that the European Union was a little late in responding to the consequences of the crisis .
It would be the first step towards a general 44 tonne limit , which is by no means desirable for the reasons I have described .
Nor do we believe that parents and older people in general have poor media literacy .
Moreover , one line for administrative expenses has been created for each programme and the amounts for the various key measures will be entered in the remarks .
( Applause from the left )
Programme of support for the European audiovisual sector ( MEDIA 2007 ) ( debate )
I have to confess that I am not entirely a fan of voluntary codes .
There is also a clear difference in the set @-@ up of the test .
In addition , there are also any number of amendments that look reasonable at first sight , but which we actually consider to be out of place in this paper on internal market strategy , as they relate to social issues and should be dealt with elsewhere .
With this document , the European Commission is , in effect , proposing guidelines for future measures to support research prior to the discussion on the Framework Programme for 2002 ­ 2006 .
Mr President , Mr Tsatsos &apos; report is an important one , and comes , as the rapporteur himself pointed out , at a difficult time of crisis in the relationship between the European Institutions and the citizens of Europe .
I voted against the compromise by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , the Group of the European People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe concerning the registration procedure because it reduces considerably the number of substances to which REACH applies .
To achieve that , a number of conditions need to be imposed on Libya , and that is what the recommendation is calling for .
We will not achieve this without the European Social Fund being incorporated into cohesion policy .
These programmes are the subject of amending and supplementary proposals for the 2008 budget , which we have put forward with our fellow Members from the five political groups .
Before the vote :
Whether the textiles industry is competitive or not , it is deplorable that 850 000 jobs should have been axed !
These are being replaced with individualised employment contracts and mainly part @-@ time jobs having precious little in the way of labour , wage , social , insurance or pension rights .
The rapporteur , faced with his mutilated draft and having taken the ultraliberal forces of Parliament hostage , thought that , all considered , it was worth supporting .
Organic agriculture is now a realistic alternative and a reliable one to intensive farming .
VOTES
Worrying signs are , however , emerging from the Council , which are at odds with this .
In contrast to what the report says , only traditional families and social respect for motherhood provide the remedy we need .
In my opinion , this is a fundamental sign of the transparency , solidarity and democracy of rights : the rights of the individual , of children , the elderly and disabled people .
It is also the case that we often tend to compare what happens in the European Union with what happens in the United States in a rather simplistic way .
In the case of serious complaints about noise pollution , the right to investigation should exist and , if necessary , action should be taken .
It is important that we do not wander from this course ; I would appeal to all the rapporteurs to maintain the consistency we have demonstrated in months of open discussion .
The paramilitaries are not parties to peace talks .
These education and training programmes improve individuals &apos; knowledge and abilities and equip them for the future .
It is entirely a matter for Parliament as to what you want to do with this particular recommendation .
However , I must say that , in terms of this legislation being forthcoming from the Commission , we have had to wait quite a long time .
During the previous question , we were discussing electoral issues .
Today I wish to express my view of the guidelines on employment for the year 2000 .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the PHILOXENIA Programme , which involves a series of measures for tourism and which , basically , we supported , has unfortunately not been put into practice in the most appropriate and desirable manner .
It seems likely that this was done for political reasons , not for strictly legal ones .
Just how sensitive the question of enlargement actually is can be seen from a unanimously passed resolution of the Upper Austria State Parliament .
We must rebalance the support given to the different types of farms , sectors and regions .
What are we expecting ?
These include the increasing numbers of those affected by human trafficking in connection with forced labour , the provision of services , forced begging by children and petty crime , as well as trafficking for the purposes of illegal adoption or forced marriages .
This is a European issue because such readings are far above EU bathing water limits and , incidentally , also a cross @-@ border issue since Thames Water is German owned .
That is why we constantly make powerful appeals to both parties .
We need to amend the directive .
It will affect countries like Tuvalu in the Polynesian islands - a country that is merely four and a half metres above sea level - and the Maldives , where President Nasheed held an underwater cabinet meeting this year to highlight the fact that by the end of the century , his country could indeed be under water .
I understand , Mr Swoboda , that you have spoken to other political groups regarding this matter .
Does he think , for example , the PR system which operates in Germany and has produced over one million spoilt ballot papers thus defranchising one million people is ridiculous ?
One of those sleights of hand is to extend the term in office of presidents in power by ten years or even to the end of his life by means of a referendum without the option of putting forward one or two rival candidates .
Given that there is much talk about EU embassies in the Brok report , I would like the Commission once again to repeat the assurances it gave me a year ago that EEAS missions or delegations will not be called embassies .
The election of the candidate beaten by Mr Yushchenko in December 2004 shows either a major split within the country , or a shift in popular feeling , with people now more favourable to the Russian influence .
Is it a matter for politicians , or should the parties directly concerned be left to work things out for themselves ?
An appeal against this sentence may still be possible , but it is clear to everyone that even demonstrators must fear for their lives in Iran .
The regulation on official controls of feed and foodstuffs requires those carrying out official controls to act independently .
However , who can say that we are actually preparing that ?
I therefore find the two amendments from the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , which recommend more than the minimum , regrettable .
Consequently , I am asking the MEPs from the PPE and UEN to subscribe to the serious attitude we need to adopt on this matter and with regard to the Uzbek people , and support our motion for a resolution , which says nothing more than the truth about the human rights situation in Uzbekistan .
In our work we will naturally be aware of the difficulties and different goals , but we will also be determined as we are also aware that the current situation does not serve the best interests of the Union .
As we explained in the text , many Member States have not implemented this directive .
In a few months the European Parliament will submit recommendations as to whether we should continue tearing down that fence , or build an even higher one .
We have been reporting this matter for many years and I am concerned to see that , despite the enormous efforts being made by the Tibetan delegation , and especially the Dalai Lama , to promote dialogue , to move closer to the Chinese authorities , to find a fair and lasting solution to this conflict , the blockade situation is continually caused by the Chinese authorities .
We cannot accept terrorist acts , but nor can we accept a military solution to this crisis .
However , the Union , which is quite capable of breaking down barriers when it comes to the movement of goods and capital , is not able to do so when it comes to protecting the fundamental right of women to be in charge of their own bodies .
Progress in CFSP ( continuation )
Furthermore , this proposal intends to step up controls and penalties in the event of non @-@ compliance with these rules and , in the light of experience , to improve the functioning of the European Aviation Safety Agency .
Industry is prepared to do this , and I would also ask the Commission to examine this issue closely .
Here we must focus on those areas that are key to Europe ’ s competitiveness and our future prosperity . These include research and innovation , innovative measures for SMEs , support for lifelong learning for renewing skills and key infrastructure projects .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is one such example .
Unfortunately , the Sri Lankan Government has been unwilling to allow the investigation to go ahead without its approval , unless the UN Member States unanimously insist .
This must not , however , be an excuse for subsidising inefficient economic sectors which cause pollution .
President @-@ in @-@ Office . - ( SL ) Thank you , Mr Mitchell , for your supplementary question .
My colleagues should know that , in a single market , it is no longer a question of relocation , but of a choice on the part of companies who have every right to go wherever they please , wherever they feel offers the best conditions for them to produce .
Since the protocol constitutes an annex to the Framework Agreement , it can be regularly renewed without the need for any new negotiating mandate .
For that reason , the Verts / ALE Group says a wholehearted ‘ no ’ to this Directive on ports .
So what we agreed was this : we shall suggest an addition - which I shall put forward as an amendment later on - referring to voluntary set @-@ aside .

It is an excellent proposal , and the work of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy was made easier by the fact that the basis for discussion was very good right from the start .
This relates to the internal market check , which we feel is rather one @-@ sided .
Secondly , I share the concerns and we are working towards a prudent and far @-@ sighted buildings policy for security and for staff .
Either way it has been a long process .
The shortcomings seen in the sector involving the cross @-@ border transfers of small sums apparently reside in the inadequacy of the legal framework at European level that the Commission proposes to present , nevertheless , the structure of this framework – the form and number of legal instruments – is still not known .
We are an area which , for the last two or three years , has a single currency .
This inevitably requires priority to be given to deep burying solutions , such as permanent storage in dry rock or permanent storage in deep cavities ( 3 000 to 5 000 metres deep ) , which are still being examined .
We might also look at the measures restricting freedom in the Arab countries in the face of terrorism and war .
Lastly , we call on the High Representative to take the decision to intervene in support of the population via a task force , which Parliament should also be involved in organising .
Finally , Mr President , I should just like to make a small comment about translation errors .
To conclude , we must therefore improve the systems that are already in place . Above all , however , we must ensure that the proposals that have already been made , the positions that are adopted in our debates and the way we vote tomorrow are not seen and perceived by our Mediterranean partners as just so many negative messages .
I believe that that is also what we need in the future : for learning to be fun .
At the present time , there are ceilings on the grants that can be cofinanced from Community funds . However , it may be necessary to adjust these ceilings in accordance with actual requirements .
In the future , it may be possible to meet our energy needs using renewable energy sources , but this is not yet possible , nor will it be possible for a long time .
It is up to you , of course , whether you exercise it .
Above all to ensure that sums awaiting disbursement do not build up too much and that there is not a build @-@ up of operations to approve and pay them at the end of the year .
The bottom line is that Europe is not a State .
The Commission proposal contains two items which are of political importance .
Health is therefore not simply an issue for individual human beings .
Confidence and trust of the users is directly related to the take @-@ up of electronic commerce and to the success of the Information Society .
Welcome
The Nice Treaty states that the European Union must be brought closer to its citizens .
This is due to a wish to avoid situations in which the Court of Justice declares agreements that have been entered into invalid .
However , in order for this principle to be more broadly accepted and applied on a broader scale by the Member States , certain preconditions must be put into place , as mentioned in the rapporteur &apos;s report .
It would be wrong to prejudice the discussions which we need to have with you , the Parliament , as well as the sports movement itself .
Mrs Sommer is still in the Chamber and I thought it appropriate , even though she is not listening , to respond to what she said .
I have but one word to say on the matter : ‘ vigilance ’ .
There is nothing nice about misleading people .
As Mr Cassese said it is as if the Council created a Frankenstein monster that happily goes his way to intervene and operate wherever he can .
As European socialists , we shall , in any case , continue to defend workers because , now more than ever , Europe needs a social model that meets the needs of the most vulnerable citizens and especially of those most affected by the consequences of the economic and financial crisis .
The more democratic and federal a State is , the more provinces , Länder and regions demonstrate their efficiency and ability to stand on their own two feet as regards the construction of the new Europe .
How can we concentrate on the enormous unemployment problem , which is indeed a real one , whilst closing our eyes to the ongoing deterioration of the environment ?
It is incorrectly worded and inconsistent with the text which was actually tabled in the joint resolution by my group and others .
As I finish , let me stress this : the environment depends on what we do collectively ; the environment of the future will depend on the actions that we take now .
We need to raise the general level of driver training throughout the European Union .
I thank him for his open @-@ mindedness and for having accepted some compromises , which will allow my group to vote in favour of his report .
The process will continue and the participants will inspire each other .
Lastly , that this migration should be carried out in a single , one @-@ shot phase , processed by all Member States .
It is fair to say that the role of Parliament in the process has been strengthened and it will also play an important role in the review of the financial perspectives , which will be one of the top priorities in the coming years .
I think that we need to take this into account .
The Presidency is currently exploring , together with the incoming Austrian and Finnish Presidencies , a series of possible measures aimed at further increasing legislative transparency in the Council .
For this reason , staff concerned with the transport of animals must be fully trained to ensure a high level of care at all times .
Yet , at the same time , the Commission allowed this agreement to be discussed and certain things to be deliberated on without informing Parliament or giving it the chance to be involved .
Violence perpetrated against women , and the relative lack of participation by them in the labour market , in education and in politics , are still major areas of concern in which change is possible only if women acquire the right to be able to speak out and to demonstrate .
As I proposed to the competent committee for content , the concept of a public document needs to be further delineated .
No other donor is able and willing to meet this challenge as we are .
Voting on the Czarnecki report will take place on Wednesday .
Without leadership , the IGC will simply result in another Maastricht Treaty , a treaty which is so complicated and so far removed from ordinary people that it may not even be ratified in all 15 Member States , let alone enable the Union to welcome new members .
The political value of this directive is of a symbolic nature .
I have spent some time this year going to countries which are &apos; complex environments &apos; , to use the terminology of the United Nations : China , Cuba and Russia .
&lt; empty &gt;
( HU ) Madam President , I completely agree with Mr Audy .
We must , therefore , continue to stress that violence against women is neither natural nor unavoidable .
We should also concentrate on the issue of direct payments and the proposal for the phasing in of direct payments . This must not be a stumbling block for enlargement .
Religion can never be a credible or acceptable reason to use violence or to breach human rights .
Namely , last Thursday , at the President &apos; s meeting , two compromises were made among the leaders of the groups .
Once the studies are finished , we will consider the appropriate measures , both in the framework of the common market organisation and vis @-@ à @-@ vis imports from third countries .
Member States must be in a position themselves to establish the level of precaution and food safety they wish for their citizens .
In Sweden , the public housing sector is a socially motivated form of business activity , and Swedish legislation on rented housing is designed to provide social protection .
We need to have the overall directive first and then work from there .
Those are all elements that should be factored in .
I think we had to stress the fact that without co @-@ ordinated educational actions and without a cultural perspective , European information society would be an empty balloon .
It has to be a very broad agenda aimed at continuing the dialogue beyond the lifetime of the current Commission or Parliament .
It contributes to the development of existing systems , cohesive values , social progress and other developments in society , and therefore needs to be promoted and given due recognition .
We are to get a quasi @-@ federal confederation dominated by the three biggest countries , Europe &apos; s former great powers .
I therefore thank the Irish presidency for its dynamic approach .
I believe , for this reason , that the proposed increase in funding for the school fruit programme , whereby fruit and vegetables are made available free of charge in the classroom , is a good idea .
To conclude , I should like to touch briefly on thematic priorities , without going into the merits of individual arguments .
I hope that the Commission can extract that from this resolution , because I believe most of it is in there .
A long list of amendments has been added to this report , many of them good and self @-@ evident .
If we had to summarise in one pillar what it is that is going to enable Europe , and all the countries that make up Europe , to be competitive in this global world , it is the qualifications of the human resources , the citizens of Europe .
The Euromed parliamentary assembly must therefore do everything it can to support , promote and involve networks and actors from civil society in its work and to develop a real independent , autonomous capacity of governments , a capacity to assess , to spearhead and to make proposals within the framework of the Euro @-@ Mediterranean policy .
The utilisation of the best technology that promotes safety , and its wider application , must become a key point of focus .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.22 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
We realize that it will not be easy to reach a consensus in the Council on all these proposals , but I am convinced that this approach should be pursued if we really do wish to make progress on tax policy .
As the honourable Member recognises in his question , in some instances , new markets are being created .
I voted for a renewed commitment to this WTO round , as an ambitious trade round but also as the development round it was originally intended to be .
Such a debate was launched this morning , but only four of us were present .
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
I would like to thank Parliament for its close interest in this dossier , evidenced by our discussions both in plenary and in the Committee on International Trade .
One could be cynical and choose , for economic reasons , to side with the strong , but that would not be my personal choice in this matter .
The remainder represented democratic systems .
It seems truly absurd that we are even considering investing tens and tens of millions of euros in a project of extremely dubious utility at a time like this , totally out of place and at completely the wrong moment in time .
We may well have done the right thing , but I fear , as the American Herald Tribune said recently , that these endeavours of ours are destined to remain unheeded , a dead letter , and so , the time may well have come - not for boycotts and sanctions , which are abhorrent to us - but , for example , to promote European tourism only in the dozen States of America which do not inflict the death penalty .
When I look at the dossiers that I am qualified to assess , the balance is positive .
The Community &apos; s Fifth Environment Action Programme protects people from the adverse effects of air pollution .
I want you to insist that this matter be put on the agenda of the next General Affairs Council and of the summit in December .
At the same time we are also diversifying oil supplies because a project has also been announced from Samsun to Ceyhan , an additional oil supply project that again will bring oil from the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea region towards the European Union .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
Cross @-@ compliance is an important element of the common agricultural policy that links most CAP payments to the observance of certain rules in the areas of environment , health and animal welfare .
By mistake , the export of inhalers for asthma sufferers and of pain @-@ relieving cancer pumps had been banned .
Since that is the real position it is not right to look away when there , years ago , human rights were trampled under foot and justice has not been done .
( EL ) Mr President , Commissioner , the question is how effective the Schengen Agreement has been to date .
As Europeans , we should not be satisfied with the situation of the European education system .
The question for us now is whether the Union is capable of responding to this situation quickly and firmly and of assessing it appropriately .
The report covers in detail all areas in which the Member States implement the budget , such as agriculture , cohesion , pre @-@ accession funds and collection of the EU &apos;s own resources via customs duty .
We cannot therefore have uniform taxation for everything , for excise duty on petrol for example .
This actually confirms what one of our fellow Members said in this House a few months before the latest European Parliament elections , which was that the European grants had not produced the desired results in Wallonia , particularly in comparison with other European regions , and that it was not only Wallonia itself but also the European Union that was responsible for ultimately approving these projects .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , first of all I want to say well done to the rapporteur , Mr Hammerstein , on his very comprehensive and wide @-@ ranging report .
With regulations , too , we are going down an entirely new road , you could say we are blazing a trail , since this is the first common European infrastructure which is being built up jointly and is under common Community ownership .
2007 discharge : EU general budget - Council (
I refer to the decisions on TARGET and access to TARGET by the &apos; Outs &apos; ; decisions on the minimum reserve requirement which were made public last week and which , I must emphasize , were the final decisions on the monetary instruments that would be used .
We are particularly perturbed about this .
there should be broad and open consultation on the matter with all interested parties , including entrepreneurs , local authorities and non @-@ governmental organisations , and I would like to emphasise the importance of such consultation ;
We arrived here last night at 10.40 .
A second equality summit took place in Paris on 29 and 30 September 2008 .
We have seen how things go with money : they go fairly badly .
Parliament has also contributed to other improvements to the common position , such as the authorisation of the committee responsible for the complex technical details and adapting the thresholds of technical development , and I would like to thank them once again for the work they have done , which has demonstrated once again the seriousness and skill of this Parliament , even when we are dealing with and discussing enormously technical issues , as in this case .
Unfortunately , fear of distorting competition often hinders even rational action .
I believe that if people cannot understand the present perfectly good health warnings , nothing will be achieved by making them twice as big ; that approach is mistaken .
The fact that you can actually have rules for Bucharest , London and Paris and consumers in those places is absolutely ludicrous .
On tropical forests it has been ECU 50 million for the last two , if not three , years .
The justification that public authorities are at an advantage in that they can obtain financing on more attractive terms than businesses , or are less dependent on building stable relationships , may be valid for national authorities or European institutions , but is definitely not valid for most smaller towns and rural municipalities , not only in the Czech Republic , but throughout Europe .
As for the rest , dealing with this at intergovernmental level and within the Community , and all the things that have been quite correctly said here , we can examine them in the future .
Nor has the Council received any request from a Member State along the lines referred to by the honourable Member .
In due course , within the House and in the appropriate fora , my own group intends to contribute to a debate which we hope will be initiated on lessons which we ourselves , as Parliament , must learn from the hearings process .
However , it will also provide an impetus to the green agenda by encouraging renewable energy and energy efficiency and a renaissance of nuclear energy .
It is in the light of this that I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr García @-@ Margallo y Marfil , for the work he has done , because it is the changes and policy direction proposed in his report that constitute the approach that can provide more jobs and greater prosperity .
I know that the workers at this shipyard should not be punished for the rather inappropriate , or simply clumsy , way these things have been handled by the present government .
There are a few aspects of it I should like to have seen given more weight .
I am talking about texts on which the Commission itself , which is usually slow to adopt positions , has expressed convincing reservations of a legal and political nature , which are , moreover , appended to our report .
Thank you , Commissioner , for your words , and I am counting on further good collaboration in the future .
Thank you , Commissioner Marín .
We must not forget that what we had before Cairo , in 1994 , was management and control of the population ; since then , we have had the concept of birth control and control of our own bodies , which is substantially different .
Mr Schulz would like to speak against the proposal .
The European Parliament and national parliaments must play a more significant role in both .
I was entirely convinced that it was very good news that France was to take on the responsibility of the Presidency of the Council during this particularly difficult period .
I think we should reflect carefully before we do that again .
I was , frankly , surprised that the other Member States conceded so quickly on the size of the Commission , reverting to one Commissioner per country .
Energy efficiency aids must be included in future long @-@ term EU budgets as well , having particular regard to the building reconstruction programmes of the former socialist countries .
Mr President , this reply which the Commission has given on automatic pilot does not answer the question which I put orally .
. – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , with the European Qualifications Framework , the Union is providing itself with a tool that can certainly be improved , but that is key to developing mobility within the European Union .
Although the agreement also declares , among other things , a strengthening of the monitoring by relevant bodies of goods in transit and the export regime or ex officio negotiations , a question arises here as to scope and other possibilities for enforcing the agreement , as its effect seems debatable without the agreed ratification by a large number of important countries worldwide .
Thirdly , the EB established a clear and future dialogue with the present board of the ECB .
We have agreed the 3 % and we therefore need a strong Commission that will , in future , monitor and also enforce that 3 % limit .
Greek euro @-@ scepticism is directed at exactly what the European Union is ; a European Union which has not progressed with the same speed as far as its political union is concerned , as far as acquiring a genuine , authentic European defence identity is concerned .
That is why I really must take it as a compliment when you say that it runs counter to Berlin .
In Parliament &apos;s plenary sitting on 20 February 2008 they all voted against the proposal to respect the verdict of the Irish people and against holding referendums on the Lisbon Treaty in the Member States .
In the European Union , for example , the number of women with breast cancer is showing the greatest growth in my own country .
To conceive , give birth to and bring up a child is not just a private matter but a public task , a state task .
I have already dealt with them in committee and on other occasions .
Austria is like no other country in the Union , surrounded by potential candidates for entry .
That is called participation , and it &apos;s called democracy , in Europe too !
Mr President , we are now taking a stance on an important issue , an international agreement , which may influence the prospects for prosperity of many Member States .
I very much support the goal of the European Commission that half of all Internet connections must be by broadband facility by the year 2005 within the European Union .
At the March conference , we must take tangible decisions such as sending a peace @-@ keeping force to protect the civilian population in the occupied territories and refusing to allow Israel to obstruct or even fire on humanitarian missions .
Member States are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas .
They have interpreted what is happening at the moment , whether we like it or not , whether we think it is right or not , as dividing Europe for a second time .
I believe that the Leader programme has in the main been successful and it should be developed to achieve more at local level .
A representative from Africa summarised the reaction : in Africa , it is regarded as impolite to invite guests through the one door and , at the same time , leave through the other oneself .
This is not true .
This instability is having an adverse effect on the process of far @-@ reaching institutional reform needed if it is to join the EU .
In October , Serbia and Montenegro hosted missions led by the Commission , in association with the experts from the Member States , and those missions confirmed that all of the criteria of the respective road maps had been fulfilled properly .
What production could be so cheap that you could compete with that ?
– That concludes voting time .
The terms are : first , a new macro @-@ financial loan from the Union for an amount of ECU 250 million .
It is unfair in itself , and all the more so because , with regard to State spending , on the other hand , there is a trend to increase spending to favour large employers and the wealthy , to the detriment of public services .
In the meantime , the Schengen labyrinth is ensuring that daily practice is generating a dangerous grey area of personal contacts between police forces over which there is absolutely no democratic and judicial control .
It is only applicable to NATO or similar organisations &apos; Status of Force Agreements designed to protect soldiers from sending States , but it cannot be applied generally to US troops or US citizens .
This first reading is a particularly important stage in the procedure because it is the stage at which each of the institutions carries out an especially detailed analysis of the Commission &apos;s proposals . It consequently provides an opportunity for all to clearly demonstrate their concerns , to emphasize their own interests - minority , sectoral or majority interests - and to ensure that they make their voice heard at that stage .
This dialogue is very important .
As far as the proposal for a conference on the outcome of the &apos; Europe Against Cancer &apos; programme is concerned , I think that it should be discussed with the next presidencies .
There are a number of reasons for this .
Great strides have already been taken from an Irish perspective and this is a model which could be used in other Member States of the Union .
I think that this responsible and realistic approach in the report should be accepted by the Commission as it stands and strengthened in the forthcoming negotiations in the World Trade Organisation .
Formulate the objectives quite clearly so we can understand them . The objectives are as follows .
It also recognises that national governments have the right to define general interest , but it is the Commission and , in the final analysis , the Court that determine the extent to which derogations may be made .
( IT ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I must say that I agree with what has been said by Mrs Grossetête because I came here driven by the intention of bringing with me the pain , regret and discontent of the wine producing world in Italy and I found myself faced with indifference , like talking to a brick wall .
We are all aware that this was a particularly tough task that you had to accomplish .
As I have previously stated , I have been the rapporteur on a number of matters , but if I can just give you a thumbnail sketch of just how extensive this review will be and what it will cover - universal service , frequencies , satellite , regulation , licences , interconnections , numbering , mobile telephones , convergence of broadcasting , data transmission and telecommunications - an explosion of legislation and an enormous segment of the European Union &apos;s manufacturing , industrial and commercial base in its own right , but also as an adjunct to so many other industries .
This should make us all proud as we are remaining true to ourselves , as Parliament , and ensuring that long @-@ term partnerships and gay and lesbian couples are not the subject of discrimination .
We are glad that you are here , even though we would have liked prior notice .
If anyone thinks that I have only cast the role of the European Court of Justice in such a positive light in my report because I shall be at the Court of Justice as Advocate @-@ General as from next week , then they are mistaken !
We are not only talking about enlargement of the EU , but also about the tasks for the DAPHNE Programmes .
A qualified groundhandler makes an essential contribution to maintaining the highest standards of safety .
I am wondering whether President Santer or the Commission has already begun to analyse the legal and social position of women in these would @-@ be Member States .
in writing . - ( HU ) Recognition of citizens &apos; knowledge , skills and competence is indispensable for the European Union &apos;s competitiveness and for social cohesion , as well as for individual citizens &apos; mobility .
I was going to go for a swim in the sea - it was an extremely hot day - at the &apos; Italia &apos; bathing resort off Corso Italia , and I was about to dive into the water when I was recognised by an old childhood friend , a municipal councillor called Egidio Saccone , the owner of the establishment , who said to me : &quot; Mr Fatuzzo , as a Member of the European Parliament , speak out and try to ensure that enthusiasts who practise all kinds of sports - swimming , boxing , field and track events , football , cycling , tennis and so on and so forth - receive a pension as well .
All we can do is hope that the Council is on the right track on this occasion and that it will look on this common position as a temporary stage on the way towards stricter measures .
Firstly , Parliament must have complete access to all Commission documents .
The Commission has tried , as the White Paper shows .
If it is not ratified , enlargement can still go ahead .
Looking only at the European Union , the fight against poverty will require a pugnacity which , it must be said , the European institutions have not always shown us .
What is needed is for the Heads of State or Government to be astute enough and wise enough to provide the legal framework that is needed to make that possible .
The first point is the question of decentralisation .
It would be best if the Commissioner for the Environment , who is from Denmark , were to agree to take out of the Commission &apos;s proposal the point relating to the proposed withdrawal of the alternative labels in five years &apos; time , because it might mean that perhaps the world &apos;s best eco @-@ label system , the Nordic Swan , will meet its death .
In the few weeks this year in which we have been able to address this issue , we have , however , been able to get the Member States to commit significantly more .
We can only deplore the large numbers of civilian victims of the conflict and the misery of the displaced populations .
The draft is open for debate and we hope you will participate in discussing it .
First of all , I would like to thank Commissioner Tajani , who , in a way seldom seen before , accommodated the requests and the justified concerns of Parliament in the work of the Commission in an unbelievably open manner .
Much of what was planned , and is essential , remains undone .
One of the discussion points in connection with the negotiations concerning the new Constitution related , of course , to whether the Euratom Treaty should be allowed to continue , as the Constitution allows it to .
Subject : CONNECT initiative The CONNECT initiative was launched in 1999 at the European Parliament &apos;s instigation .
The general opinion is that governments should pay much more attention to the ethical aspects of biotechnology .
If we could all agree not to put the amendments that we have tabled to the vote tomorrow - I would just like to see them presented - and to concentrate on voting with a large majority or perhaps even unanimously for more safety and greater European powers , we would be doing more for the reputation of the European Parliament and for the process of drawing consequences from the events in Japan than if we continue with the disputes that we are always having .
As for the first point , I very much hope that we can resolve these things amicably , and I am sure that if both honourable gentlemen put the case that they have put to me with equal force to their first cousins in the United Kingdom Government , that will very much help to resolve these issues without it taking too long .
Our efforts to persuade Russia to invite the ten new members of the Union to St Petersburg are also having positive results .
When there is further reflection account may be taken of the fact that not all Member States would be agreeable to such a collective approach .
If you rule that we will not suspend the debate until tomorrow morning - and I understand that is implicit in what you are saying , though I would question it - could you a least say that the Council will reply in writing to the specific questions put by Mr Spencer on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy and that we will have that reply tomorrow before the vote ?
We know that global competition in the television sector has often led to uniformity of supply : they all compete with the same sort of soap operas .
In my opinion , such a debate within the College is normal , absolutely normal .
At present - as Mr Swoboda has just said - there is a concern that military conflict in the Kurdish region will spill over into Iraq .
The first relates to the Founding Act between NATO and the Russian Federation of May 1997 .
A few dissidents question the reality of this phenomenon , without offering any genuine proof .
I would like to draw attention to several specific matters .
Subject : Cyprus
Rumours are one thing and facts are another .
I do not deny that there is a legal requirement .
This is the reality of the situation .
On this subject , the minority opinion of Mr Krivine , Mrs Boumediene @-@ Thiery and others , who see these expulsions as a &apos; violation of the rights of migrants &apos; , and who clearly wish to open Europe &apos;s borders to immigrants from the entire world , is quite enlightening .
If the – who , unfortunately , shares with me and with others a long experience of fighting terrorism – will allow me , I would like , as well as expressing gratitude for these gestures – and this applies to both sides of the Atlantic – to say that we must not confuse stoicism and resistance with cowardice and appeasement ; that terrorism must not only be fought with tanks , planes and invasions ; it must be fought with dignity , with resistance and also with the necessary coordination of intelligence services and with legislation such as that we have been trying to create in the European Union since 11 September .
We will continue to insist on it but , as you know , trade negotiations are bilateral and plurilateral negotiations : we need to receive this offer from them and we are trying hard to put pressure on them to make such offers .
Whereas , in 1976 , values described as ‘ adequate ’ , still put between 7 % and 9 % of bathers at risk , the WHO now stipulates values permitting a maximum risk of 5 % incidences of illness among bathers .
Now to the next item . We want to spend ECU 35 million on BSE research .
This is basically cosmetics - things to boost people &apos;s egos , making a huge amount of money for the industry .
The idea of the EU prescribing how much of each type of energy is to be used is an absurd notion that is dangerous for the future of Europe .
By looking for innovative solutions , we contribute to an increase in the well @-@ being of society .
. On Thursday 17 November 2005 , the plenary in Strasbourg will be voting on Guido Sacconi ’ s report , ‘ REACH : establishing a European Chemicals Agency – Persistent Organic Pollutants ’ ( A6 @-@ 0315 / 2005 ) .
A fundamental condition for effective state function is that the area of taxation is in good order .
Mr President , I have to say that my previous remark was not meant as a joke but as a formal protest .
The discussion on the situation in Tunisia and Egypt will follow and I am sure that my colleague Cathy Ashton will be able to address it in more precise terms .
Thirdly , the European Union will continue to urge those States that have not yet done so , to become party to the Statute , because we believe that the broadest possible participation is both desirable and necessary .
We engaged in a wide @-@ ranging consultation exercise with all the parties concerned , including Mr Rothley , with a view to deciding how best to proceed .
It has been quite impossible for us to obtain definite information as to how the various amendments tabled affect Parliament &apos;s budget .
The first trend , represented by Mr Schwaiger among others , would require us to change the procedure .
As it is , if we go on with the expectations that we are arousing but cannot fulfil , we will not do Europe or Europe &apos;s consumers any good .
As far as we are concerned , it is vital that this money be spent on social measures in future because , according to our initial calculations , around 7 000 jobs a year could be scrapped due to restricted fishing efforts , in addition to the other jobs which will be lost this year anyway , one reason being the increasingly modern and less labour intensive techniques being used in the fisheries sector .
We also know that the question of cars already on the road , which has been raised by many colleagues , is essential .
The agreements we have concluded with both Australia and Canada have always been more acceptable and more in line with the principle of proportionality , as they allow for limited access in scope , in time and in the number of details , as well as oversight by a judicial authority .
I ask for more respect from you , Baroness Ashton , for us Austrians in this very sensitive area .
But on the other hand , the sound rule of macro @-@ economics should not be misused by pinning it down too much .
There is absolutely no doubt that victims of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation are considered victims of Nazism .
This would be a sign that every country in the Balkans , if it makes the appropriate efforts and meets the criteria , has a chance of becoming a Member State of the European Union , something that was recently promised in Thessaloniki .
Therefore , no , I am not ashamed . I am not questioning the victims ; I am questioning the use , by Italian Members , of a Thursday afternoon sitting reserved for human rights issues to debate an issue which strictly concerns Italy and Brazil .
If the system cannot cope somewhere in one country , the integrated nature of the electricity grid means that this will have major repercussions on other countries in and outside the European Union .
I voted for this Directive because I feel that Portugal has much to gain , as it will accordingly derive maximum benefit from the internal market .
It was only last May that the European Parliament conferred with Prime Minister Deuba in Brussels .
Existing programmes , such as the European Neighbourhood Policy and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights , have cultural components which need to be coordinated and strategically deployed .
Science and the experts are suffering the consequences of serious crises ( for instance , mad cow disease ) and indeed the implications of crises to come , because they cannot tell us what the results of their interventions will be : dissemination of GMOs in the environment , manipulation of the living organism , genetic manipulation .
We can all send a positive signal by voting for the report by a large majority .
I just want to reject emphatically the fact that this side of the House is against consumer rights because we are not committing an advance to a proposal for which we do not even have the information .
In this regard , we need greater cooperation between the customs authorities and consumer protection authorities in the Member States in order to protect consumers from unsafe imports .
During the course of the first debate on the Méndez de Vigo / Seguro working paper in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , one of the requests made was for the historical introduction in the first part of the report to be angled not from the point of view of the Council &apos; s victories or the Commission &apos; s victories , but from the point of view of Parliament &apos; s defeats .
The President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council told us in all honesty that Council is at present rather confused about asylum and immigration policies .
It is the first time that it is on the table , so it goes without saying that it will require fine @-@ tuning in future .
Mr Papayannakis , if you have not received an answer , you should do what you have done and ask here in the House why your question was not answered .
Mr President , I merely wish to observe that Mr Moorhouse is far too left wing to have a place in the modern Labour Party .
The second topic concerns the currencies of emerging market economies which have current account surpluses and exchange rates that are not sufficiently flexible .
To move forward in the negotiations , the EC issued in mid @-@ September its own proposals on finance .

These things may at present be pipe @-@ dreams and fantasies , but I consider it necessary to proceed in this way in order to turn them into a reality .
Therefore , whether or not there is an agreement with the International Monetary Fund , there will be support for FYROM , although it must clearly be conditional upon the application of the necessary reform programme so that these funds will be put to specific effective use .
Otherwise we will be too late once again .
What is every bit as important to me as playing for millions with the threshold value in the directive on European procurement is the protection of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises from unfair competition .
Perhaps attention could be paid to those languages in which the word &apos; gouvernance &apos; , first used by Sir John Fortescue in England in the fifteenth century when the English political class spoke French , is less clearly understood than in English and French .
In order to prevent the introduction of possibly contaminated food and feedingstuffs into the food chain , the necessary containment measures have been taken for these installations .
The EU is calling on Turkey to do more in the area of minority rights , but instead of resolving the issue of the Kurds as it had said it would , Turkey is planning to ban the pro @-@ Kurdish Democratic Society Party ( DTP ) .
It is also necessary to introduce different procedures because , following enlargement , the European Union would otherwise lose its ability to act .
When will they be started ?
If it is a matter of maintaining the international legal order , the European Union must , together with others and within the multilateral frameworks , be able to accept its responsibility .
The roadmap meant to lead to the 2009 Climate Conference in Copenhagen is the flimsiest of documents .
The fight against IUU fishing constitutes an essential component of the common fisheries policy and the EU should be able to foster international cooperation on this matter by participating actively and constructively in the adoption of an international instrument on port state measures .
The nations of Europe will certainly still compete against each other for these orders but they will compete against each other on price and on quality .
Mr President , I do not think there can be any among us who do not support every effort to disseminate and promote books .
The time has come to wake up .
Mr President , next Friday the Council will make a decision that will affect the future of the European Union – on opening accession negotiations with Turkey .

( The sitting was closed at 23 : 00 )
Mr President , that is what we agreed .
( FI ) Madam President , first of all , I want to thank the rapporteur for what is an excellent compromise .
Concerning the question about transparency , we definitely support transparency .
( Applause )
Mr President @-@ designate of the Commission , in today &apos;s vote for your nomination as next President of the Commission you will receive the support of the overwhelming majority of Liberals and Democrats in this House . Your performance in yesterday &apos;s debate was assured .
I repeat : intervene when citizens &apos; rights are violated .
To stage major events to reach as many people as possible in one go ?
I thank the rapporteur for having added some water to his wine , if I might use that expression .
The temporary breaks in women &apos;s careers in science due to family reasons make promotion of women difficult .
We therefore need to ensure that the Structural Funds mesh well on the ground with the new agricultural Rural Development Fund .
They include measures to be implemented in the first quarter of this year , such as wage bill cuts , reduction in public employment , progress with health care and pension reforms , tax and excise duties increases and tax administration reform .
The second suggestion that we considered was to work with what I will call a structured network whose origins are found in civil society .
In a Parliament resolution , this House made a very clear call for the passengers affected to be better protected .
The European Commission , as well as most of the Member States , has massively responded to the needs of the affected population , and are prepared to provide help also in the future .
They clarify several points in a useful way , in particular as regards the neutral display of travel options on the travel agent &apos;s screen and the protection of personal data .
In the current political climate , the European Union needs to ensure that it makes good progress on a number of crucial issues at this summit .
I was very pleased to hear the President @-@ in @-@ Office stressing the value of Parliament &apos;s role and contribution .
You have our support for them .
In the short term , it is clear that this system must be maintained , that justice must be established - that you can certainly not impoverish some in order to establish justice for others - and that we must ensure , in the future , common management of resources , by the fishing professionals to begin with .
The 1993 directive on the organisation of working time was therefore a major achievement .
The Commission has just directed that the sum of EUR 5 million be paid under a fast @-@ track procedure for a food safety programme in order to enable Georgia to meet its most urgent needs during the winter months .
This precise point appears on the agenda of the Finnish Presidency , which has decided to devote a large part of its work to the matter .
I fear that these tools are marvels only for those who are already structured , already well @-@ versed in this general culture , which will enable them to profit from them , while they pose a serious threat if we regard them as a palliative .
Mrs Ferreira &apos;s report is concerned with preventing severe macroeconomic imbalances .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the text of Mr Rothley &apos;s report has been long and difficult in the making .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the PPE @-@ DE Group was dismayed to hear of the British Government &apos; s plans with regard to the cloning of human embryos .
The report draws attention to the major problems associated with branches of companies that benefit from different tax systems , frequently within the framework of a single company , but in different countries .
In a choice between fulfilling their legal obligation to implement Community legislation and responding to a possible breach of WTO rules , the Commission and Council opted to ignore their statutory EU obligations in favour of WTO considerations .
There are undoubtedly criminal immigrants , just as there are English , German and Greek criminals , but the immigrants &apos; only real crime is that they were born in poor or war @-@ torn regions .
We have taken the first steps on the path of a very important discussion .
in writing . - ( PT ) It has taken 50 years for the EU to achieve the free movement of services enshrined in the 1957 Treaty of Rome .
This was a supplementary to Mrs Pailler &apos;s question . That question referred to the fact that on the evening of 26 March the French authorities refused 3 000 Italian nationals entry into France .
Rap , hip @-@ hop , contemporary creativity in general , all these artistic movements which have been censored or threatened with censor are shot through and enriched with the diversity of the world &apos;s cultures , and call upon us to open our hearts and minds to welcome the foreigner in the words of Jacques Prévert : &apos; Strange strangers , you are part of the city , you are part of its life.&apos;
President Lukashenko is continuing his illiberal policy by stifling the voices of a great many , mostly young people , who are demanding a future of freedom for their country .
Whether this is from public or private injection or a combination of both is another discussion , but we must have one soon .
I believe that is the spirit in which we must confront this unprecedented challenge for the European Union .
As I said a week ago in Brussels - a new year , a new treaty , and a new era for the European Union .
It is precisely for this reason that the van Nistelrooij report was very deserving of my vote in favour .
9 .
The Commission has made its proposal in line with this reasoning and I ask the European Council to be faithful to the same reasoning , which in any case follows from its previous decisions .
To avoid a contradiction between their standards and our standards , we have decided - as I announced today - on some kind of harmonisation , at least with Japan , while we are reviewing scientifically the global standards we can implement for any kind of imports to the European Union .
We must have clear , precise , simple and effective Community regulations and this is the raison d &apos;être of this agreement .
When we vote on it , as we will do tomorrow , we will be bound by the rule that a majority is required to reject or amend it .
Perhaps the questions will be discussed ...
The Commission , together with all stakeholders and , in particular , with the social partners , will step up work to gather data and identify the necessary solution to apply in the future in such cases .
As long as the rules stay as they are , these matters are the concern of the Commission , and they must be dealt with by the Commission . The Council may not interfere .
I can obviously only applaud the fact that we in the Council act counter to your views and , as Mrs Trüpel stated , are dealing with a very independent Parliament .
Thirdly , simply making the fuel cheaper will not achieve this aim .
Calendar of part @-@ sessions : see Minutes
We are after all discussing the events of 1995 and it is now the beginning of 1997 .
If the report is adopted in its current form , without taking into account a number of proposed amendments , it will for example no longer be possible to record radio and TV broadcasts for short @-@ term use for the inmates of care homes , hospitals , prisons and so on .
I would also like to thank the rapporteur , maybe in writing , for his efforts and for the overview reflecting the contributions made by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , as well as the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee .
So there is no hurry .
We are negotiating an agreement in which the subject of energy is essential ; these negotiations are beginning , and we have the best prospects for them , but obviously , like all agreements , it is something that depends on very complex negotiations that are , in turn , part of a series of negotiations on this cooperation agreement that we want to update - as I said - because a great deal has happened in Europe in the past 15 or 20 years .
We may each have different views on the Treaty of Lisbon .
The Bank &apos;s activities should be made more transparent , they should be more locally based and be clearly focused on the main objectives of the Union &apos;s development work .
Otherwise , this Directive will be less effective in practice .
I will check with the Commission as to whether the Commissioner is available to come to the House this week or , if not , on another appropriate occasion .
However , an increase in the level of protection and security needs to be accompanied by a guarantee of passengers &apos; rights and dignity , as stipulated by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
Member States would be in a position to decide with their own fishers which of those measures would be best suited for the realities faced by the particular fishers .
The rules are sufficient , but there is a lack of political will and determination .
They seek , in our judgment , to introduce an unrealistic objective , increasing energy intensity to 1.5 % over and above what would otherwise be achieved .
This Parliament voted unanimously for the application of consistent , coordinated measures to halt the decline of biodiversity by 2010 and to promote the sustainable use of the seas , protecting and conserving marine ecosystems .
Yet , in our social model there are services of general interest , and in developing countries such general interest services have yet to be formed .
I hope that my fellow Members will be prepared to remove this blot on this otherwise excellent report .
In addition , the new budget line &apos; Preparatory action : Migration management - Solidarity in action &apos; , which is the name of the project , will be used to assist Member States faced with particular difficulties .
It will allow a wide debate of all stakeholders on an approach which should further reduce the costs to our economies of reducing greenhouse gases .
( Applause )
I refer primarily to social and economic consequences on a regional scale .
4. fair encouragement of investments including for international connections ,
I think the rapporteur has seen to it that it covers the whole issue , however .
These are matters of great importance for all EU States .
At present , all radioactive waste on the peninsula is kept in medium @-@ term storage facilities either on land or on board ships .
Joint motion for a resolution
The difference in production between less @-@ favoured areas and lowland areas must be compensated for as the future of these areas and the future of land @-@ use management are dependent upon it .
The Sofia City , unlawfully supported by the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria , has acted without the mandatory environmental impact assessment by the Ministry of the Environment and Water and without subsequent hearings of the affected population .
Would a busker fall within this scope ?
The recipient last year of this new prize was Mr Nelson Mandela .
The Council is also looking forward to the planned census being held in accordance with international standards .
Since we have some very modern Members , they are also bound to use modern means of communication .
That in itself is an important result , an initial but fundamental step towards the gradual harmonisation of national legislations .
Mr President , I am very pleased to see URBAN orientated towards a more integrated approach which attempts to solve interrelated problems .
Mrs Gebhardt , you say we usually hear this at the beginning , but that time has already passed .
in writing . - The European Parliamentary Labour Party welcomes this resolution , which shows strong and clear unity between EU Member States in the Council and the European Parliament on this vital issue .
I was amongst the first in this House to call for a no @-@ fly zone .
We already have some basis for consensus in the paper I presented to you today .
Mrs Miguélez Ramos , I cannot agree with your assertion that the regions are as much States as the States of the Union , because the latter are the only members of the Union and the only ones that have the right to participate in the Council of Ministers .
But we should also turn our attention to a few of the less attractive issues : the flax case , the latest developments of which , it is true , we are not yet fully conversant with , the mafia case involving adulterated butter , and , indeed , the Fléchard case .
Fellow Members , I am also asking for your support so that we can achieve a truly free market and equal rights for all European citizens .
My own Member State , the UK , has already started the destruction of some 30 million explosives , changed its export control regulations and directly contributed to the clearing of ordnance , including cluster munitions in Georgia .
It is in the light of this that I wish to criticise the &apos; now or never &apos; mentality .
On the WEU : clearly , we still have to work on that relationship .
I would like to conclude by thanking Mrs Kauppi for all her hard work in the European Parliament and I wish her every success in her new venture .
In these circumstances , it is important that Parliament reiterates its appeal to the Council and to European Union Member States to maintain and increase the pressure on the Iranian regime on human rights issues .
These proposals are a good starting point , but I need a few more things on top of that .
The European Commission has finally given its approval to the Spanish plan for providing assistance to the mining sector but has again demanded cuts in coal production by the HUNOSA mining company , which means that for the second time it has failed to recognize the agreement between the Spanish Government and the social partners .
Otherwise , this will cause a total breakdown in the good intercommunal relations we enjoy at present .
In the meantime , China joined the World Trade Organisation and , in recognition of this fact , it was decided to phase out these quantity limits , which will , therefore , disappear completely at the end of 2004 .
Mr President , allow me to make a brief comment .
The 5 % proposal requires far more serious consideration .
in writing . - ( FR ) There are 25 national legislations governing mortgage credit , and soon there will be 27 standing in the way of a common European approach .
Reaching a decision before the summer is crucial to restoring confidence in the euro , given that the Stability and Growth Pact was being broken as early as 2003 .
In conclusion , we need the regulatory authority to be strengthened and integrated , antitrust to be strengthened and , in the immediate term , a more active and effective attitude from the Commission .
Wednesday :
- ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Parliament , in its capacity as budgetary authority , must make its assessment to contribute to the review of the 2007 @-@ 2013 financial framework .
I shall not quote anyone , but will say that the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats has no need for lessons where respect for human rights is concerned .
The Bureau now intends to present a working paper by a British Vice @-@ President which proposes moving all the services and Directorates @-@ General from Luxembourg to Brussels .
We need closer cooperation with United Nations organisations such as the FAO in order to ensure that the allocation of these funds genuinely serves to improve the levels of nourishment and living conditions of poor peoples .
Europe , the European Union , I say again , and this is a matter of fact , does not have any competence to obtain authority or to require a reply on the criteria that govern inclusion in this no @-@ fly list .
. Mr President , on paragraph 3 I have agreed a compromise amendment with the PSE and ELDR Groups , as well as my own Group , to add the following after the words &apos; the retail investor &apos; : &apos; when the different regulatory authorities at European level recommend it is appropriate &apos; .
I think it is very important that we should allow as few derogations from the rule as possible .
It is a serious warning of the EU &apos;s growing power over the Danish legal system that an EU institution should have the power to prevent Danish courts from carrying out those tasks that fall to them under the constitution .
Fighting paedophilia , and related evils such as sex tourism and child prostitution , on the one hand , and taking action to prevent child abuse within the family and the production and distribution of child pornography , above all on the Internet , on the other hand , therefore present a very particular challenge , not only to the Member States of the European Union , but , we believe , to all states .
The positions adopted by the European Union so far , and its policies , contributed decisively to the dissolution of former Yugoslavia , the outbreak of war and the preservation of the present abnormal situation determined by the protection of foreign troops not only in Bosnia , but all over the Balkan area , either in the form of multi @-@ national forces as in the case of Albania , or in the form of military bases and facilities .
This aid is considerably less than the previous period , 1993 @-@ 1995 ( a 13 % drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8 % to 2.6 % in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector ) .
So why question it ?
I am sorry that Parliament will be pressed for time this year in order to give its opinion on the employment package .
The aim of this Fund is to ensure the necessary level of solidarity in the future between those who benefit from trade liberalisation and those who will lose their jobs as a result of globalisation .
in writing . - Laboratory tests must be carried out in order to identify harmful organisms that are not present within the EU .
Evading justice is common and a person legally sentenced in one European Union country should not be allowed to stroll peacefully down the streets of other Member States .
The ECB also acknowledges that there has been a lack of clarity surrounding this extra bonus .
Does it depend entirely on context ?
I believe the agency has a vital role to play in ensuring that new drugs get to the market safely and with the minimum duplication of effort on the part of individual Member States .
I am well aware that everything depends on your discussion with the Heads of State or Government , but as President of the Commission , you must share your vision with them .
Each element of it – not just the tariff cuts – will provide substantial improvement in market access , as required under the 2004 Framework Agreement .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , may I point out that Mr Cunha did not put a direct question , but since I do not agree with his last statement I would like to make the following clear .
For me this is a vital point at this time .
I cannot give a comprehensive answer today to the question of what financial resources would be needed for a so @-@ called BSE crisis package , since there are still many unknown factors in our calculations .
Working time in mobile road @-@ transport activities
We are still faced with low demand and price fluctuations in many sectors of agriculture .
You can clearly see from the text our condemnation of the military actions and the disproportionate reaction of Russia .
What I would ask your House to do is to help us and the Commission get a majority for this target at the spring summit of the Heads of State or Government , for I regard it as one of the most important that we have to achieve .
Valencia has helped us to evaluate and debate this situation , and it has taken place - despite the enormous current tensions and emotions - within the framework of a debate which at times was genuinely constructive , which has demonstrated the parties &apos; desire for peace and I believe it can be of use to the whole process .
Mr President , I refer to yesterday &apos;s Question Time , and in particular page 24 of the Minutes .
The EU also needs to invest in health care , agriculture , and transport and energy infrastructures .
The European Union &apos;s view , as has incidentally been reasserted in declarations by the Council and by its representative in this House , is that extraterritorial legislation is unacceptable in law and in principle .
Immediately after the summit , Commissioner Lamy talked of mediaeval organisation .
Amendment No 44 , on the other hand represents a technology @-@ neutral compromise solution and has the merit of being a fully harmonised EU approach to unsolicited commercial e @-@ mail .
I would like to recall that the Commission never had the option to build new buildings for the EIT , but to come up with the new approach .
This has been an important first step in strengthening EU @-@ Brazil aviation relations which has allowed Brazil and the EU to further enhance aviation cooperation and move towards negotiating a comprehensive air services agreement between Brazil and the EU .
Would you first of all accept that this is not just a German debate and that there are other elements to this discussion ?
According to the Commission &apos;s assessment , this application fulfils all the legally established eligibility criteria .
But did you say , for example , how you intend to deal with something as simple as the dispute over the paper on future food policy , which the Commission announced over a year ago and which we are still waiting to see ?
I therefore share your concerns .
Furthermore , I think that , before applying the new regulations on dairy quotas starting from 2015 , producers must have the opportunity to adapt to market changes and to invest according to market demands , bearing in mind in particular that the deadlines for investment aid applications are relatively lengthy .
We need , certainly , a special focus on alcohol @-@ related harm in young people .
When the reform of the COM in tobacco was approved in 1998 , Parliament and the Council planned to carry out an assessment of this reform at the end of 2002 .
- ( NL ) The division of poverty and welfare among countries and among groups within one country is becoming increasingly unfair .
We want a free trade agreement between the EU and India that helps to promote sustainable development , and that is accompanied by clear clauses concerning respect for ILO standards , environmental rules and corporate social responsibility obligations .
Guillermo Fariñas , last year &apos;s winner of the Sakharov Human Rights Prize , has accused the Cuban regime and , in particular , the First Secretary of the Communist Party , Raúl Castro , of Juan Soto &apos;s death .
( NL ) Madam President , Commissioner , you have talked about three things for which I believe you will be able to count on the support of a large majority in this House .
In this report , I have proposed a number of solutions so that you - fellow Members - can engage your electorate effectively and well in the process of European integration and , in this case , by actually strengthening the common market , increase their share in the common market , that great success of the European Union .
We have here a good example of a Europe which is close to the people .
What exactly they were summarising escaped me , but the headings were certainly right .
You can already receive e @-@ mail messages on mobile devices which are connected to the Internet .
I hope Parliament will lend its strong support to the agreement in Wednesday &apos;s plenary vote .
However , as far as Portugal is concerned , they are limited because they do not grant a special status for non @-@ European Portuguese @-@ language productions .
If a large number of products contain CMR substances , we should obviously act even faster .
Mr President , I would really like to repeat what I said last year .
I believe that the clarification offered by this framework agreement is good for both institutions .
The European Parliament is launching a powerful appeal to this effect to the conference on disarmament .
Why , so soon after its reunification , does it already appear so divided ?
We have an opportunity to ensure that our products enjoy a good reputation and are protected from unwanted imitation .
The provisional application is decided by the Council on a proposal by the Commission .
It thus follows that ships can go to these countries outside the EU to fill their tanks if bunker oils are covered by the directive .
These efforts by the Estonian Government must encourage us to speed up the process leading to Estonia &apos;s accession to the European Union .
The hopes and actions relating to the development of renewable energy sources are not having an effect quickly enough .
Sustainable development and social justice make sense not only when the general indicator of the economy and of human prosperity increases , but when social cohesion also progresses .
I hope that all three will carry equal weight .
That leaves me utterly dismayed .
In answer to Miss Eriksson and Mrs van Dijk , under Article 7 of the Financial Regulation I have to remind them that the projects financed under this regulation shall comply with Community law and Community policies , in particular in relation to environmental protection , competition and the award of public contracts .
One concern I have about the Commission ’ s document is that it focuses strongly on aid for innovation by SMEs .
Clearly , other principles must apply regarding individuals , law firms and associations .
B4 @-@ 0955 / 96 , by Mr von Habsburg and others , on behalf of the European Parliament People &apos;s Party , on the arbitrary arrest of Tomislav Matanovic , a priest in Prijedor , and his parents by agents of the self @-@ styled Republic of Srpska .
Whether or not it rains , groundwater supplies have difficulty maintaining their levels and replenishing supplies .
Once again , commercial concerns are being portrayed as acts of generosity .
As we all know from experience , in the era of globalisation , helping to break Cuba ’ s isolation through greater economic cooperation would not fail to have positive repercussions on its internal politics , beginning precisely with human rights .
However , as a result of the low administrative capacity of the administration departments within the ministries , the rate of absorption remains one of the lowest in Europe .
We must have a risk prevention policy .
Secondly , environment policy in Europe is known for the priority it gives to patching up the effects of damage to the environment , rather than actively preventing it from occurring .
It is stipulated that , in the event that there is a new member of the Commission , they must attend a hearing before the European Parliament before commencing their duties .
This is not fair .
You acknowledged yourself , Commissioner , that the World Summit on the Information Society produced valuable results ; it also had a spin @-@ off , a focusing effect .
Vertical Restraints
The artificial construct that is Belgium is still as ungovernable today as it was six months ago and there is nothing that can be done about that , because Flanders and Wallonia have evolved into two different countries with totally different political and socio @-@ economic cultures .
There was , however , a perfectly acceptable solution based on consensus , without the need for a vote . If everyone had been in favour , this item could possibly have been included in the agenda .
The second point I want to make is that it has been suggested that the trend for economic support is downwards .
Therefore , we need to stop for at least a second or two to think about the reasons for this .
They have criticised the country &apos;s leadership and president .
I hope that the three conditions , the conditional discharge and the obligations on those concerned to address these conditions will be taken seriously .
I have a very specific question for the Commissioner .
As regards the liberal professions , a subject we have already discussed in this Parliament , in February I will present to the Commission a report – which will subsequently be published – on the liberal professions in Europe .
Activities aimed at structural reform have been made the main instrument of development .
These will not prove successful , however , because I fully agree with the Austrian position that we should try to achieve something even better .
It is now absolutely imperative for us to address the issue of the borders of the European Union - and I do not just mean its geographical borders .
However , apart from the positive aspects , there are also many development problems in India .
How that is to be recorded in the Minutes is a matter for Parliament ’ s administration .
( CS ) I abstained , because the answer to the question &apos; is it true that the Georgians attacked a sleeping city with rocket launchers ? &apos; is &apos; yes &apos; .
I would like to point out that the proposed agenda was mostly prepared before the onset of the crisis , but in spite of this I want to make it clear that it was and still is a good basis for facing the crisis .
( Parliament approved the Minutes )
You want to report back in March and we fully support that aim .
Their children might practise a different occupation from their parents , perhaps in a different country , but undoubtedly on a scale which is no longer just national but at least Community @-@ wide , spanning all the EU countries .
Something more has to be done in this area .
Above all , as regards decision making , should the unanimous rule , which is the only way to guarantee security , be maintained or should we opt for majority voting , which we usually do when there are drifts involved ?
It is very much in the interests of both countries that they continue their cooperation and overcome any nationalist and extremist ideas which have been at the root of much misfortune suffered by the whole region in the past .
By taking this step , we would be cutting the ground from under the fraudsters &apos; feet , simplifying the system and avoiding needless controls , with all their vexations , which are a further burden on our small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
The European Parliament would do well to keep this in mind .
I also think it would make us look a little ridiculous .
It will still be possible to reach agreement on equity rules , on rating agencies , possibly even on questions in connection with derivates and their licensing , but there will be argument on the question of unfair competition , taxes and control .
The broad guidelines adopted by the European Council in Lisbon , Corfu , Essen and Cannes bear witness to the European Union &apos;s intention to draw up a long term programme for its relations with Mediterranean countries .
We should indeed put the issue of export subsidies on the political agenda and keep it there .
It was a parliament that did not have any powers .
Yet the 2006 budget fails to take account of these factors .
Our duty is to ensure respect for the principles of the rule of law .
If the Committee on Culture and Education voted to keep the name of &apos; European Heritage Label &apos; - for which the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) was hoping in particular - it is because this initiative is not limited to the period of history of the European Union , but focuses on the grand idea of Europe , a much older concept .
Now we have seen a number of significant amendments with support for an oversight ethics committee , and modifications to prevent the patenting of life .
I believe there are solid opportunities .
Perhaps we could look at the Court of Auditors &apos; criticisms particularly .
This dossier should really have gone to conciliation , though , because the correlation tables were not included in the final agreement .
What increasingly worries me , though , is that policy @-@ makers at the national and international level can think of nothing better , when new problems arise , than to respond to them with new regulations , new directives and new measures .
( Parliament gave its assent )
The 2011 budget will be the first Union budget to be agreed following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon .
Common responses to the issue of immigration are required .
The first results of this will be available by June .
I particularly welcome the fact that the directive exempts national contract law , in particular provisions on the drawing up and fulfilment of contracts , from its scope , and concentrates on essential matters .
What we miss hearing is a declaration on your part that the Constitution is dead and buried and a statement calling on us to start afresh and to allow supporters and opponents of the Constitution to draw up a common discussion paper .
Not only do Parliament &apos;s reports fail to get their act together and move away from the Commission &apos;s disastrous policy ; on the contrary , they add fuel to its fire .
To this extent , I recognize great parallels with the draft directive on consumer goods guarantees .
And too little attention is paid to additional standards which cannot be divorced from &apos; sustainable growth &apos; , namely environmental standards , social , international standards , bans on child labour , forced labour , equality of the sexes , freedom of expression .

In contrast with other times when the European Parliament , in non @-@ binding discussions , accepted the principle that workers &apos; representatives should have the right of veto , as in my report on the role of women in industry , it has now refused to include this in the directive on the European Works Council , which is regrettable .
Lastly , I would like to put a question to Mr Patten , though he has just left .

. In this debate on the situation in the Middle East , I want to remind Members that on 31 May 2005 , Parliament voted through a resolution entitled ‘ The Assyrian community and the situation in Iraqi prisons ’ .
That is what we want to do , that is what the Council is working towards .
We are trying to address the problems we have uncovered this year and help the Greeks .
Mr Albertini , the answer to that is that we adopted Amendments 13 and 18 and so the original paragraph on which you had the oral amendment fell .
Mr President , we will vote against this report not least because the rapporteur proposes exerting pressure on the Commission and the Council to speed up the process of visa liberalisation for Kosovo .

If the EU were to make a decision on a constitution , right under the nose of the new EU Member States , that would be a triumph for the arrogance of power , and democracy would have lost out .
It enables us to come up with a global strategy and to create synergies ; and creating synergies between the budgets of the Member States and our budget is an extraordinarily European system to give more value to public resources and to create a real method to turn the 2020 Strategy - long and ambitious as it is - into a European reality .
An instrument as worthwhile as this deserves a solid legal basis , therefore .
Of course , there has been an increase in the number of working women over recent years , but remember that Beijing concluded ten years ago that , if we continue at this rate , we shall achieve equal numbers in 2500 years .
It is a real labelling con .

Whatever the cause , it would be wise to produce a list of the most dangerous sites and to relocate them away from housing .
Sadly , we are compelled to note that the process of democratisation has received a severe setback , in that this forthcoming election will be less democratic than the previous one .
I believe this choice should be respected .
We therefore need to promote the use of Euro II and Euro III .
EUFOR troops should therefore be deployed specifically in these crisis areas .
The second reservation relates to the Commission &apos; s interest in regulating time limits , because I am wondering : is a long procedure a factor in the rejection of asylum seekers ?
In any case , the Commission does not intend to propose to the Council that the ASEAN @-@ EU regional cooperation protocol of 1980 should be extended .

This is very important .
I appreciate too that we are running into a new era where import controls will be different and a new sector will be joining our textile industry .
The information provided on price increases in Germany , when the reform of German law prevented international exhaustion , is conclusive .
If we do that , there is a danger that Parliament &apos;s big groups will fund their own political objectives out of common administrative expenditure , and that will be a financial burden for Parliament after 2008 .
In my view it is now necessary to adopt a formula which allows for this right thinking and I believe that the European Union is in a good position to contribute to this .
Thirdly , the investor is protected against misleading advertising , in that it is ensured that issuers , when describing their product in the media , cannot promise more than the security can hold in accordance with the prospectus .
But we must not overlook that in this field too , unfortunately , the east @-@ west conflict has left its traces behind .
I hear with interest what the Commissioner has to say , but she will know very well that there is no comfort in that response for many lecturers in the United Kingdom who assumed that they were going to be guaranteed the rights they had in their previous employment .

We have to do more to find a cure ; we have to do more about taking care .
Last week , Mr Barroso quite rightly called on the Heads of State or Government to take responsibility for the European project before their citizens .
To quote a simple example , it has been calculated that , to obtain compensation for damage in the sum of about ECU 2 , 000 , a European consumer today , involved in cross @-@ border litigation , would have to face average legal costs amounting to ECU 2 , 500 , not counting VAT , and not to mention innumerable risks ; indeed , there is not even any certainty that , if he won his case , he would then be able to assert his rights , because it may well happen that when the time comes for payment the other , defeated party has disappeared or is no longer able to pay .
( DE ) Mr President , Mr Langen , I just want to make sure that you are familiar with our ideas .
Turkey has merely been recognised as a candidate .
The changeover will require an effort .
I am preparing for a visit to Belarus , where we have to work a delicate balance , because we want to offer something - particularly to the population .
In 2002 , for instance , the difference was EUR 200 million .
However , the aim of the consultation procedure has not been overlooked : namely to bring about agreement between the two arms of the budgetary authority with the help of the Commission .

The principle of the oral amendment is that any research on the embryo must be forbidden unless its aim is to help the embryos development .

You have brought forward a raft of energy policy proposals , including proposals on energy policy in relation to nuclear safety .

On the other hand , we must observe our commitments to climate protection .
We also think it is unacceptable for products resulting from processes such as sugaring to raise alcohol content to be called wine .
There is one point on which I am in complete agreement with the Council Presidency , and that is that no headway will be made , either in the Council or in Parliament , if there are those who see their role as being to speak up for special interests , while others see themselves as responsible for brokering compromises .
Europe ’ s citizens have their own worries and their own aspirations ; these they address not only to us in this House , but also to the Commission .

. – Mr President , no questions have been put to the Commission and I have nothing to add to the debate .
We condemn these acts , indeed we condemned them on the spot , and have done so here on several occasions .
As for the possibility of us periodically carrying out a quantitative assessment of these incidents , I believe that the Spanish authorities may be able to provide the necessary information in this respect .

Religious groups themselves , however , must also remain tolerant towards those with different beliefs from their own , and must respect freedom of conscience and of the individual as well as obeying the law of the land .
In the past the Commission continually assured European consumers and Members of this House of the quality of imports into the European Union .
So we need to be careful of the moves we make .
We also need to clarify another point , i.e. that we are calling for an international solution because this is an international problem and international problems require international solutions . We are here to talk .
I therefore voted in favour .
As far as access to documents is concerned , certain interinstitutional arrangements are currently in place , and each institution also has its own procedures .
We achieve protection by imposing rigorous limit values .
Above all , I believe it is a political mistake to translate the way in which budgetary austerity is carried out in the Member States to the Union &apos;s budget , and there are two reasons for this : firstly , because budgetary restrictions are being applied to a Community budget which by its very nature does not have the capacity for indebtedness .
The adoption of this ILO convention can help reduce the numbers of working poor , improve working conditions and facilitate the social inclusion of some of the most vulnerable workers .
Of course I cannot go into details on this question now - I am not really an expert on these financial negotiations - but I can tell you that you were right in making the point that every aspect of tax management naturally has a major effect on the entire global economy .
But I cannot do the work for France , for Italy , for Poland , for Romania , for Greece and for Luxembourg ; that has to be done by those Member States alone .

The AFET / SEDE opinion proposed to delete the Low Value Shipments CGEA because we were provided with good data proving that there is no positive correlation between a low price and a low security risk , an assumption on which the whole CGEA relied .

It also provides a valuable , if underused , resource for employers .
Providing the public with information relating to decision @-@ making is , in my opinion , a matter for citizens &apos; associations .
How is that to be achieved in the time ?

Strategic reflection is now needed for the future , if we are to continue to have the same levels of efficiency .

That policy guideline is indeed part of the integrated guidelines adopted by the European Council in March this year .

The Commission considers that the position of the Court of Justice is clear as far as the special rights in the games of chance sector are concerned .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as Mr Vecchi , the person who tabled the resolution , has just said , the American court @-@ martial has delivered its verdict and the pilot of the aircraft involved has been cleared .

I wonder whether the procedure used would have been the same for the least important Member of this Parliament .
I find the Presidency &apos;s appearance in this House prior to every summit an interesting idea .

President Kim Dae @-@ jung emphasised that Sweden &apos; s long @-@ established contacts with the countries on the Korean peninsula could play a valuable role during the Swedish Presidency .
Fears were also voiced regarding corruption , since opportunity - or a great deal of money - makes the thief .
I also believe that this Agency must be designed to actively seek solutions to the problems arising from cyber crime , which means , of course , looking very closely at the particular situation of risk and greater exposure with which our children are confronted .
I still find it hard to understand why the sharing of responsibilities between the Community and Eurocontrol has not been resolved in a truly definitive way .
Total liberalisation of current accounts for all residents , of capital accounts for investors of practically limitless assets without any rules for financial services : for the matter of financial services , as for the matter of climate change , therefore , we are adopting rules that we cannot then manage to ensure are respected either internally or in our external dealings .
– Mr President , like Mr Dick Marty in the Council of Europe , Mr Fava has the courage to coordinate an investigation with a very clear objective : to establish the truth .
Not having access to the Internet or lacking ICT skills is becoming a barrier to social integration and to personal development .
Of course , among the issues faced by society is the question of addiction , which is extremely important and which has been highlighted in your report , and there is the question of minors .

The text on which we are preparing to vote tomorrow is an excellent foundation for the negotiations ahead of us .
The solution , then , is clearly to create public stem cell banks , as it is only with public banks that we can guarantee equality of use , equality of access , effective medical treatment and more research that is equal for all and not just treating stem cells as some sort of commodity or a business which is expanding , but is only for the privileged few .
That is its value .
Safety at work policies must be implemented and harmonised , reducing health risksall too often newspaper articles describe unthinkable events for our European society .
Within the open method of coordination which has already been mentioned , the Member States are , in fact , encouraged to provide adequate minimum standards .
For me this is a kind of model and I very much hope that , on other issues on which we have such legal disputes , this will serve as a very good example of smooth relations between the Council and Parliament .
Such a president also organise and plan for a longer period than just six months .
( ES ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let us imagine that tonight , when this interminable debate finishes , we go out and we meet 27 fellow Members downstairs and we have to decide unanimously which restaurant we are going to .
The stance adopted by Parliament at first reading is a sensible one and it is in line with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice .
Finally , we must severely punish those involved in this system .
I too am one of those who believe that it is preferable for China to be integrated into the disciplines of the World Trade Organisation than to be a free and unruly system .
I am , however , grateful to the honourable Member for his warm welcome to his home city ’ s success in securing the Olympic Games and let me assure him that there are plenty of opportunities in bilateral forums and indeed in contact between the European Union and other nations outwith the European Union to raise exactly the kind of concerns of which he spoke this afternoon .
Mr President , in today &apos;s oral questions , the passport freedom which exists in Scandinavia is referred to as the Nordic Passport Union , but that is not its proper name .

Over the last year , especially in the context of the response to the Haiti disaster , the Pakistan floods and today in response to Libya , we have built very strong and effective working relations with the EU military staff in the European External Action Service to the point that now EU military staff designate liaison officers as part of our humanitarian operation , so we can make sure that we plan and execute together as one .
Just imagine what position Germany or France , not to mention my own small country of Estonia , would be in if they were to be on their own in negotiations with the USA or China at the WTO .
( DE ) Mr President , Mr Hahn , Mr Andor , ladies and gentlemen , I do not need to emphasise how important cohesion and regional policy is for the process of living together and growing together in Europe .
Since 1997 , the Commission has been responsible for implementing the Daphne programme , which is specifically designed to combat violence against women , adolescents and children and which will be succeeded by the Daphne - 2000 @-@ 2203 programme ( approved this very day ) , which has the same objective .
One of the most important innovations that the Commission introduces in the communication concerns a &apos; new &apos; working method .
All these pressures , often exacerbated by weak responses by governments and public bodies , are threatening our ability in Europe to realise the great potential which biotechnology offers us .
We are told that data protection will be in compliance with relevant European standards , but I read in paragraph 3 that the Americans will process data in accordance with applicable US laws , and in paragraph 1 that data will be handed over as required by the Department of Homeland Security .
For that , we need to use , more than ever , the project @-@ oriented EU bonds , we need to engage more with the EIB and we need to find ways to use public @-@ private partnerships more in the future .
We could point to many of these results , and I am delighted at the energy with which the Austrian Presidency is working to achieve concrete results .
It is for the citizens of a Member State to decide whether or not they will choose to fund national political parties or independent representatives .
Indeed , Ljubljana hopes to finish incorporating the Community acquis during the Spanish Presidency , within the second half of next year that is , maintaining the steady rhythm demanded by the current Belgian Presidency as well .

Madam President , Commissioner , I wish first of all to thank you for being here today and for the statement you have just made , which attests to the sensitivity you have shown throughout the years towards the European textile and clothing sector .
This proposal will be supported today .
In this context , the report &apos;s objective is less about persisting with a doctrine than about providing you with a necessarily evolving roadmap , for all the new institutions that are being established and that must learn to work together .
An international competition system must create minimum norms so as to prevent anti @-@ competitive behaviour such as the forming of price and area cartels , the misuse of a market @-@ dominant position or vertical and horizontal competitive restrictions which distort competition .
This report must , therefore , be supported enthusiastically by those who ?
I welcome the fact that they are at last getting the tools with which to do the job , but let us give them the time to bed in and to actually go about making the place safe for humanitarian aid and support them while they are there , rather than sniping at them with the sort of nasty , political comments we heard from the extreme Left here today .

It was then that the Council adopted its conclusions on these matters .
– Mr President , despite the satisfaction and , in certain instances , the self @-@ satisfaction which prevailed following the summit , it is becoming clear that the 25 endeavoured to manage the collective embarrassment which the institutional crisis and the impasse concerning the fate of the Constitutional Treaty continues to provoke .

Secondly , concerning the distribution of the PHARE programme money and the management of those monies : where are the biggest pitfalls that the Croatia financial management system has to overcome ?
Finally , the Member States and the Commission should use all the means available to them to eliminate the stereotypes that contribute to discrimination against women in the workplace .
It is precisely for this reason that I feel that the European Union must be visibly active within its borders and proactive in any area of the world .
It does remain a tricky subject , though , because whilst the interests of the different countries do not always run parallel , law and order do remain important in world trade .
I have asked Sir Brian for such a response but , once again , he has chosen to ignore my request .
Thus it will just be a case of normal parliamentary ratification .
This is precisely what has happened in the report before us .

The term &apos; area of cooperation in the field of education and training &apos; requested by the Council has excessively technical and abstract overtones and would be difficult for people to understand .

Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , shortly after this Parliament was voted in , we were immediately faced with the issue of suspending the Generalised System of Preferences ( GSP + ) , in particular , with regard to the application or nonapplication of this mechanism to Sri Lanka and Colombia .
I see this as a risky strategy as long as there is no framework provided for it .
It might be salutary for the Commissioners to instruct their staff to give briefer and more pungent answers to Members &apos; questions which in turn would allow more Members to get a chance to raise the concerns of their constituents .
However , they face challenges such as global warming , which is a huge challenge for them .
Improving the energy efficiency of buildings could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
We should recognise the government and also perhaps place an international United Nations force in Gaza and the West Bank . In my view this is vital .
The fact that that is not possible in the long term has been demonstrated very painfully here again .
However I also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here .
Regarding the issue of restructuring , various options are , as you know , under analysis .
author . - Mr President , last September , a member of the Ugandan Parliament introduced an &apos; anti @-@ homosexuality bill &apos; .
It is of the utmost importance that the channels of communication be kept open , and a constructive stance will be required from both sides to ensure that the accession process is not delayed or does not completely degenerate into mutual distrust .
So it will limit it , and this can be done on the basis of this compromise .
Since the new protocol has solved the technical problems and opened up a more secure procedure for settling technical differences between the parties , that will surely lead to a greater number of vessels wanting to access this fishing ground , which is becoming safer by the day , and therefore offering more guarantees , than in the previous protocol .
This linguistic diversity has been put into practice in the Member States for the European Year of Languages .
We should build on the national strategies that we have - where they exist - and encourage the setting up of regional initiatives and tools to jointly address security threats .

It is crucial to implement the strategy in good time and I too would very much like to see an interim solution .
Closure of sitting
Thank you very much .
Secondly , in our view , it is very important that donations are voluntary since we must remember that AIDS in fact originated in North America due to the abuse of trade in blood from Haiti .
We are currently working on this issue .
These dimensions should definitely also be adopted for use throughout the entire area of the EU .
To divide the new programme into two sub @-@ programmes would be an over @-@ timid approach .
The present situation is rather like Luxembourg spending money to build dykes but the Netherlands seeing no need to do likewise .
For this reason we need a place for political dialogue , for mutual discussion . That was the special thing about the Lomé Convention , and we should advocate it in the future .
If we do not suspend the Association Agreement with Israel , then not only will the Israeli tanks have crushed the territories , they will have also crushed Article 2 of this Agreement , as well as Article 2 of all the Association Agreements .

Parliament welcomes the Centre &apos;s initiative to run a computerised network for the collection and exchange of information called the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction .

Counterfeiting , piracy and infringements of intellectual property in general are part of an increasing phenomenon today , one that has taken on an international dimension and represents a serious threat to states and to national economies .
If the Commission really and truly wanted to introduce a real Plan D , its first decision would be to call for constitutional referenda in the countries where the European Constitution was adopted by parliamentary decree , frequently by acclamation .
I would say that it is no excuse that Member States in some cases deliberately drag their feet on implementation of employment non @-@ discrimination , but it is an excuse , and the Commission must not allow the slowest to dictate the speed of the rest .
Apart from eliminating discrimination , which also means between men and women , we have the responsibility to implement proactive measures to encourage professional careers for women .
So , let us instead concentrate on the essentials , namely the harmonisation of environmental standards and the entrenchment of a high level of environmental protection in industrial activities .
However , let me make this very clear : Member States alone decide whether and how to use cord blood stem cells .

The creation of &apos; intermediate regions &apos; as proposed in the report means that relatively rich areas of poorer Member States will still receive support , and will be able to prepare gradually for the point in time when they lose this additional funding entirely .
A further crucial aspect is the fight against passive smoking .
Trade has always been the defining factor of EU @-@ ACP relations , and what was once confined to unilateral trade preferences for commodities and raw materials in the early days of Lomé has now been replaced by more diversified trade in manufactured goods , services and ideas in the 21st century .
The roots of the present situation go far back into history , to the pre @-@ colonial era . However , we are not here to analyse the historical events that have led to the present armed conflict in the Kivu , or to lay the blame for those events at any particular door .
We hope that these efforts will result in a final statement which , due to the careful process of preparation , will receive ministerial approval in the Algarve .

Vietnam benefits from the European Union &apos;s preferential tariff system .
Well , they are men who have women behind them looking after the home front .
– Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the fact that the new external borders are to be set wider , with consequent migratory pressures , leads me to welcome your setting as a priority the reinforcement of the area of freedom , security and justice .
You did not always get your way , and nor , for that matter , did I , so , speaking personally , I ask your indulgence for all the things I put you through .
That dealt with perhaps a much more complex problem because of the staffing situation there – it being a much older foundation .

For services provided via an establishment in another Member State – for example a hospital or a home for the elderly – the service provider will have to comply with all the relevant rules in that Member State .
I hope that colleagues across the House will recognise those particular qualifications .
Bad textbooks on economic policy are legion , but never yet have I found one so bad that it would recommend these courses of action in a phase of the economic cycle such as the one that we are now in .
This is an important programme which complies with our commitment to achieve a high level of health protection in the European Union .
I cannot agree , however , with the statement that military personnel died &apos; defending freedom &apos; .
My Group does not seek a dispute with the Commission .
It considers issues that , as this debate has illustrated , will become increasingly important in the future .

At the European Council in Thessaloniki , as you know , the Convention &apos;s final proposal was presented by Mr Giscard d &apos;Estaing .
One is that we spoke about a technical analysis .
For that reason I would like to say that I fully understand people getting annoyed with people who overstep the limits of courtesy , or who insult someone &apos;s religion on purpose , but the punishment which is administered from government beats everything .
In practical terms , this paves the way for false reporting and , if not false , then at least incomplete .
As Mr Santer said , this is not a negative judgement on the Italian presidency - it is as well to remember Mr Santer &apos;s whole sentence and not continue the election campaign which has not borne good fruit in Italy anyway .
Just as the European Treaties define the competences of the Union , so the national constitutions should be able to ring @-@ fence certain matters of wholly national concern .
A survey carried out in France , for example , shows that 83 % of the people questioned have heard of nosocomial infections , and that these risks are the main source of concern for French people when being admitted to hospital .

If consumers know where a product was made , they will also more easily avoid purchasing hazardous products , of which there are still very many , despite improved controls .
I hope that this type of problem , which is a result of over @-@ implementation rather than under @-@ implementation , will also be addressed in the report that is provided for in Article 16 ( 4 ) of the Services Directive and that is required to have been produced before the end of the year .
We would like to see a faster tempo here .
I would have preferred it if we could have made do with a code of conduct , which operates very well in a number of Member States .
I would like to point out that it is a question of incorporating enlargement in terms of the trans @-@ European networks and of exchanges and of this European area in which it is transport that guarantees the reality of a market and the capacity for goods and people to move around throughout this European area .
It is a concrete measure that will cost little or nothing and that will make a considerable contribution to attaining our ambitious climate objectives .
We will formally hear the case against the proposal and then I will take a speaker in favour of it .
However , the regional waste plan has never got off the ground and two infringement procedures have already been opened .
Moreover , it is worth noting that the Internet , considering that we are talking about online gaming , already provides us with a range of security measures that we can build upon , such as the obligation to sign up before one is allowed to play , or the tracing of certain activity which could be fraudulent in nature , or even the identification of the credit cards that are used .
The first thing to be done is to arrive at an unambiguous definition of the term frontier worker .
We are not asking you to agree with everything we say .
Finally , we object to the Commission proposal on the statute and financing of European political parties .

In a few weeks &apos; time , the Convention on the Future of Europe will be presenting a draft treaty for a European Constitution , and the next Intergovernmental Conference will be getting underway .
Mr President , faced with the social catastrophe which the collapse of Sabena represents for Belgium , I should like to add a little humanity to this sitting , by dedicating my first words to all those who , from one day to the next , found themselves , to put it bluntly , deprived of their jobs .
In fact , we were got started too early , and now we have to pay the price for that a second time .
The treatment of the indigenous minorities , particularly in the Central Highlands and in the north is unacceptable by any international standards , even if one allows for their negative role in the national liberation struggle in Vietnam in decades past .
Last but not least , I would like to touch on the relationship between international trade and climate change .
Labour MEPs have worked closely with our regional representatives , with local councils and with trade unions to identify our priorities .
There are twelve different systems for suspension of payment in Italy , and in Denmark all creditors are treated equally , even the State and the social security authorities .
After all , blunt military repression of opposition forces only leads to a nigh hopeless spiral of violence .
Our SMEs must also be involved in the construction process . This is why we set aside 40 % for subcontracting in the procurement plan .
This is why I ask you to reject the two strangely identical amendments tabled on this matter .
Our strengthening of human rights needs to acknowledge a truth which we should all accept : that the right to be protected from torture and ill @-@ treatment must be considered side by side with the right to be protected from the death and destruction caused by indiscriminate terrorism , sometimes caused , instigated or fomented by nationals from countries outside the European Union .
Please remove these placards now .
The Gazans also knew who they were electing and why .
The motor vehicle industry is offering to cut average consumption by 25 % , purely by taking technical measures .
Today , however , amidst the storm that has broken out in the Middle East following the irresponsible decision of the Netanyahu government in Israel to proceed with settlement of the eastern areas of Palestine , this debate on the agreement takes on special significance and should send a clear signal from the European Parliament to the Council of Ministers of the European Union to embark on decisive action and , also , to the protagonists in the Middle East crisis .
The Union &apos;s approach has evolved a great deal over the years and since the start of the 1990s the focus has been on the issue of democracy as an aim of all development cooperation .
Islamic fundamentalist terrorism shares both ETA ’ s objective of destroying democracy and the fanaticism with which ETA takes action against its victims , who are always innocent , but they differ in terms of their strategy , their organisation , the way they act and the support they receive .
In 2005 , the European Parliament awarded the &apos; Ladies in White &apos; the Sakharov Prize .
First of all , at this very tragic time for Haiti , I would like to reaffirm our complete solidarity and desire to help its people and all the victims of the earthquake .
These are issues which certainly need to be addressed by the international community because , not only is the situation not improving , it is getting constantly worse .
The EU must stipulate as a prerequisite for Serbia &apos;s accession that it should run its judicial system without discrimination and that , instead of delivering intimidating , prejudiced verdicts , it should catch the real villains , Serbian war criminals .
I therefore want to conclude by inviting you all to a seminar on 15 June in Brussels where we shall , for the first time , present a proper factual comparison from the patient ’ s perspective of Europe ’ s healthcare systems .
Tajikistan has great problems protecting the border , particularly as there is a large Tajik minority on the Afghan side .
A very important part of the Act is reducing the red tape affecting SMEs in Ireland and the EU .
Mr President , I believe that the objective of achieving greater protection for the consumer in relation to tobacco consumption is absolutely shared by all of us .
On this point let me just say that , by definition , activities related to young people and their employment involve mainly voluntary provision at local level , usually with citizens &apos; associations and non @-@ profit @-@ making groups , in other words in some way related to third @-@ system employment , a subject to which , as we know , the European Parliament attaches particular importance .
If an integrated approach is to be adopted , then what is needed is a dual strategy ; integration into existing funds , but a separate financial instrument in future .
If Turkey joins the EU , their Islamists will use the human rights legislation as a shield from behind which to advance their jihad in Turkey and Europe .

Young people are currently becoming unemployed straight from education .
Indeed , the new legal framework on maritime pollution and the future Lisbon Maritime Surveillance Agency , established by the Brussels Council last month , leads us to believe that Europe is finally assuming its responsibilities .
Consequently , it is our job to continue to demonstrate ambition and leadership but , at the same time , and here I am replying in concrete terms to Joseph Daul , to say that our offer , especially our financial offer , is a conditional one .
The Charter will also help define a &apos; collective patrimony of values and principles and a shared system of fundamental rights which bind citizens together and underpin the Union &apos; s internal policies &apos; , a patrimony we must constantly defend against the racist and xenophobic tendencies that have , alas , not disappeared .
Your responsibilities are not just limited to a square mile in Brussels , you are responsible to 370 million Europeans - 370 million Europeans who are represented by this House , and it seems that you still want to hide more from us than you reveal to us .
Support from my fellow Members of this Parliament will give it the political clout needed to bring about the changes it recommends .
It will be wellnigh impossible .

Combating discrimination of all kinds and bringing about participation in public life by the disabled are important jobs .
In this connection , the requirement for informed consent on the part of the donor , supplied in a specific form either by the donor or by next of kin is particularly important , as is the prohibition of the removal of cells or tissues from foetuses originating from the voluntary interruption of pregnancy or from cloned human cells .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , ladies and gentlemen , I am very glad to see that the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Jozias van Aartsen , has been able to join us for this important debate , and I hope this will become regular practice in agricultural matters under the various Council presidencies .

It is our declared objective to bring to an end the era of animal testing .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as draftsman of an opinion on the Galileo proposal , I would like to focus essentially on two financial aspects of the Commission &apos; s proposal , leaving the rapporteur and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism the task of discussing its merits .

Per capita GDP rose by more than 3 % and inflation tended to fall throughout the region - certainly not to the level we consider acceptable here at home , but what is important here is the trend .
( CS ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I welcome the enterprising report by the rapporteur , Mrs Jensen , because the decreasing quality of ground handling services has , over the last while , become an increasingly urgent issue and the true Achilles &apos; heel of the aviation industry .
It is important to say that many of the elements and proposals formulated emanate from the various actions undertaken by the Commission between the years 1987 and 2002 within the framework of three successive &apos; Europe Against Cancer &apos; programmes .

In the border area between these countries , called the &apos; Parrot &apos; s Beak &apos; , they are caught like rats in a trap in fighting between Guinean troops , shadowy rebel movements and the gang of murderers known as the United Revolutionary Front .
I am able to support Amendments Nos 7 to 11 on replacing the &apos; open method of cooperation &apos; with &apos; cooperation &apos; .
Finally , I should like to point out that the individual components of this proposal , by which I mean maintaining premiums at current levels , adjusting thresholds to current production levels , the three @-@ year period of validity and promoting diversification , form a balanced entity which is tailored to producers &apos; requirements and takes account of new prospects .
As regards the proposal to make a deduction in the aid for the calendar year 2008 , and bearing in mind that the tobacco cultivation contracts for the 2008 harvest year were concluded some time ago , the Committee on Agriculture considers that approving that proposal could give rise to a whole series of legal actions or , at any event , to a dispute which would ultimately cause serious harm to farmers alone .
The benchmarks used for professional performance essentially continue to be predominantly male @-@ based .
We have made better arrangements for information , we have defined the rules for reimbursement more precisely , and we have laid down the European reference networks that ensure that the quality of care will be improved .

Our Parliament could have done much more in this vote today to protect people from cancers , from leukaemia , from non @-@ Hodgkin &apos;s lymphoma and a whole range of other diseases , and I am very disappointed indeed that we did not take up that option , which had been put forward in the Committee on the Environment .

Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , although the past few years have seen enormous progress in our knowledge of the prevention , diagnosis and treatment of illnesses that put women &apos;s health at risk , there is still a great deal to be done in this area .
The interim agreement contains a reference to a democratic form of government and human rights .
I would like to know if you can distinguish between Mr Bloom and me or whether I am to regret that you associate us both in the same struggle because we clearly hold radically opposing positions .
We must therefore support the political groups of Philippine members of parliament who are going to present a draft abolishing the death penalty in that country ’ s congress , so that that abolition can become a reality and the death penalty in the Philippines can come to an end .
To Mr Arlacchi , I would say that we agree that the efforts made to date have not been sufficiently coordinated .
Poznań has also sent the message that the current financial crisis is not to be seen as an obstacle to further action on climate change , but instead as yet another opportunity for transforming profoundly our economic system and moving toward a low @-@ carbon economy .
We must ensure that those women who work part @-@ time have the opportunity to change to full @-@ time and we must allow positive discrimination so that men can take on women &apos;s jobs but also so that women can enter the male @-@ dominated professions .
It goes without saying that this is in the interest of everyone who gives credit and of everyone who sells goods on a hire purchase basis , but there is , at the end of the day , such a thing as the individual &apos;s own responsibility .
This will mean that countries with a high level of protection may risk being overrun with advertisements and marketing from firms and from countries which have a lower level of protection .
I want to thank the French Presidency and Commissioner Barrot for the enormous commitment they have made in this case with a view to reaching agreement at first reading .
I read an interview with a Uighur woman , for example , who said : Would you like to be governed by yellow communists ?
Therefore , it is necessary to supplement financial resources for research and development and to encourage private investments in this field , while the funds obtained from bids within the scheme should be used in the fields of research and aeronautical innovation , which are capable of providing concrete solutions .
In fact , here in front of me I have the document dated 27 September 2002 , proving this .
I call on Parliament to overturn the relevant resolution as unacceptable , since it undermines the role of our parliamentary delegation following its very successful mission to Tirana .
This will be of critical importance .
Divergence of contract law at national level leads to additional transaction costs , legal uncertainty for companies and a lack of consumer confidence in the Internal Market .
And I am not talking about the moral aspect of this experiment , the scorn of the East by the West in a society where money is the measure of all things .
We are seeing trafficking in human beings , the genuine social exclusion of millions of illegal immigrants and the despair that this situation generates deserves closer attention .
New policies need new resources . A total reform of the financial perspectives is essential .
This is an issue which we have discussed on a number of occasions with the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy and with the group of MEPs who are monitoring the situation in Belarus .
They also agreed on a new mechanism for their meetings with greater frequency , so as to strengthen and deepen the EU @-@ Mercosur political dialogue .
Mr Walter is quite blunt on this point : the future enlargement must , under no circumstances , be carried out to the detriment of the cohesion countries .
Many of them do not fall into the category of &apos; refugees &apos; as defined by the Geneva Convention .
Turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud , corruption , mismanagement and nepotism : the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by Commission officials of perceived wrong @-@ doing .
Concerning sustainable growth , it makes sense to have better integration of environmental concerns .
Human rights , to me , should include pluralism , good governance , an independent judiciary , a free press , as well as free and fair elections .
Amendments 23 and 24 ask for a time period for the Commission to scrutinise and publish applications .
At the time , enormous pressure was brought to bear on the defenders of ethical principles , who were told that , important as the issue was , it must be not be allowed to lead to the blocking of this important research programme , of which the protection of embryos formed only a very small part .
That concludes questions to the Commission .
( PL ) Mr President , as early as October of this year , the press was already indicating that the Czech Presidency might pass unnoticed .
The package is also a unique example of how we can succeed - if only the will is there - in combining ambitious legislation with the concern to safeguard a competitive European industry .
It is of utmost significance that the European Parliament expresses its opinion on the Kashmir earthquake of 8 October .
In this declaration , amongst other things , we vigorously condemn all forms of intolerance , hostility and use of force against persons or groups of persons on the grounds of racial , religious , cultural , social or national differences .
From the point of view purely of principle , we believe that the EU should not fix the salaries of MEPs elected by people in each of the EU countries .
I was recently confronted with information alleging that sterilisations of Kurdish women have been carried out in Turkey .
The fauna @-@ flora @-@ habitats legislation should have been implemented by 1994 - it is now the year 2000 .
So I was a little surprised when you commented on the social EU , seeing it as a conflict between national systems and the rules we have in the EU .
Market access is being hampered by non @-@ tariff barriers to trade , such as health and safety requirements or technical barriers , quantitative restrictions , conformity procedures , trade defence mechanisms , customs procedures , internal taxation , and a failure to adopt international norms and standards .
I still have another eight items on the agenda , and I cannot simply ignore them and move forward one particular item .
The protests were put down in a particularly violent way and the prosecutions are still going on .
The Chinese are already producing and exporting high @-@ quality and technologically complex goods .
In Hungary a significant proportion of the maize crop was destroyed due to drought , and more than 400 hectares fell victim to flames in forest fires even though our fire @-@ fighters bravely stood their ground in Hungary - and in Greece too .
Neither the present initiative , nor the review of Decision No 1692 / 96 , contribute to this .
We have set a lower threshold excedence for SO2 which I recognize is quite optimistic but , in view of the serious effects on public health of high levels of SO2 over even a short period of time , I hope the Commission and the Council will find a way to reduce their existing figure , even if they feel they cannot go the whole distance .
Mr President , I am very pleased that the political groups have reached a compromise position on this report , which actually consists of two reports rolled into one .
The framework directive and the specific directives cover both these spheres of action .
Under President Kim Dae Jung , Korea has started an economic reform beginning to address some of our long @-@ standing concerns .
The second amendment the Commission cannot accept is Amendment No 7 . This relates to a simplified transit procedure , which the Member States can establish through bilateral or multilateral agreements or apply to transit operations within their own national territory .

I do not know of a single example of a country which made any progress by applying their directives .
The nuclear issue can no longer be dealt with by sidestepping public opinion , which is increasingly unfavourable towards it .
I hope that what I have said on behalf of the Presidency will be a final contribution to the debate in Parliament today on the basis of so many reports , the authors of which - Brok , Böge , Sommer , Turco , Görlach and Olsson - I congratulate on behalf of the Presidency , since they have been extremely useful in terms of clarifying our ideas about what we need to do within the enlargement chapter .
The report on the future of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) is heading in this direction .
Bearing in mind also the widespread crisis that we are unfortunately experiencing , we can do nothing other than to sustain the quality , traceability and transparency of information associated with agricultural produce .
This will require further work with the individual countries of this region , which must strengthen their capacity to meet the membership criteria , as well as with the entire region , which needs a framework for discussing and resolving the problems they share .
When the Commission waited 15 months before handing over the documents it was asked for , it was seriously neglecting its duty to cooperate honestly with the Ombudsman .
I call upon the Commission to show greater courage in relation to national governments and to report to Parliament if governments , as a result of their stalling tactics , not making a decision , or their unacceptable and unreasonable influence , prevent the Commission from adopting a certain stance or making clear decisions .
Allow me to add a few comments on two subjects of particular interest to the Members of this House .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of my group of the European People &apos;s Party , I would like to add my personal endorsement of the proposal for a resolution presented today by the other groups , thus the PPE approves the wording in its entirety .
Against this background , it is of course right not to want to go ahead with a European corporate governance code , because it will not work without a common , harmonised system of company law .
Thank you .
What is needed here are detailed regulations covering all EU countries .
I would like to finish by talking about shared management and the audit chain , and to reiterate my proposal to include the national courts of auditors more in the process since , according to the Council &apos;s Decision , we will never have national statements from the governments .
This monetarisation is clearly excessive because the production and trade that meet the people ’ s material needs are drowned in the speculative waters of international high finance .
This requires a Court of Auditors that can actually audit the multiple action of expenditure rather than merely looking at whether the rules are satisfied .
So we are not talking here about pizza delivery drivers , but about light commercial vehicles , which , at present , are allowed to do anything they like , including travelling at extremely high speeds , seven days a week , twenty @-@ four hours a day , with no ban on driving on Sundays or at night , and without being checked up on – the consequence of which is an increasing number of accidents .
I see the difficult of policing an institution which contains the likes of Mr Bernard Antony , who was convicted on 15 May in Montpellier for racism , fined FF 50 , 000 and received a six @-@ mont suspended jail sentence , and Roberta Angelilli who endorsed the re @-@ enactment of the book @-@ burning of Hitler &apos;s Nazis in Rome , but can the President assure me that in future the security services will try to ensure we are protected from this kind of vandalism ?
At the hearing , we were told that she will work on developing new structures for the future of Europe .
Apart from this basic conflict , the other mid @-@ term adaptations are consensus between the three institutions ( with the exception of the ICI + ) .

I am sure that European cinema helps European people – mainly the young people – to understand each other &apos;s sorrows and joys .
I just want to say that for both of us this journey was something totally outside the normal political routine .
I support the Council ’ s position and the ECB President , Mr Trichet , in the comments he has made .
I believe that the Caveri report ends up making you a good offer , in the form of a transitional arrangement .
Mr Wurtz did indeed explain that his colleague had been mislead , but you raise another issue , which I have also recognised . We are going to look into it , together with the Quaestors , to prevent this happening again and ensure that security checks are in place .
( FR ) Mr President , if that presents a problem , then I myself am also presenting a problem .
Lastly , we know that anyone who claims to meet the needs of the citizens must first ensure their total involvement in public policy decisions .
It is depressing that we have heard , here today in the House , intolerance promoted .
Closer cooperation , at least as we view it , must comprise two main elements .
Cohesion policy should certainly remove the current physical , administrative and regulatory obstacles and reduce the &apos; border effect &apos; between territories and regions , permitting them to address their shared challenges together , whether these be territorial , global , economic or societal .
- ( EL ) Mr President , let me begin by expressing my deep satisfaction with the agreement that has at last been reached on the amendment to the Regulation establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security .
It serves as a social model , an economic model , a political model , and also as a model of integration .
Mr President , firstly , it goes without saying that the decision taken by the Council is not prejudicial .
Member States &apos; National Action Plans must focus more on implementation .
In my view the European Parliament &apos;s main task is to bring about the announcement of new , orderly elections . We all know these would be the first orderly elections given that - and we too are guilty here - we supported a government and a president although we knew the election had been rigged ; we decided on this approach , this support , in the name of monetarism and financial commitments .
This Parliament has repeatedly pointed out to the Commission and the Council over many years that there is an urgent need for a directive on a framework for services of general economic interest .
4 000 homes were severely damaged and tens of thousands forced to evacuate at a total cost of EUR 150 million .
Excuse me , Mr President , but I thought that you had received an official request to postpone my report to a later part @-@ session .
It means that these are not only trade and free @-@ trade agreements between the EU and the ACP countries , but also economic partnership agreements with the main aim , and I insist on this point , of leading the member countries of the ACP group to conclude trade agreements with each other in terms of investment , intellectual property , transport , infrastructure management and laying down standards , in order to establish economically @-@ relevant zones themselves .
These issues will be coming up before us again in the near future .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon .
So there is also this very important aspect , that olive oil only represents 3 % of total oil sales worldwide , and is therefore a minute part of the world oil market .
Apart from needing to get used to considering them as not always incompatible if force is required to serve clear political objectives - and it is our responsibility to compel our respective governments to assume theirs , - I will state quite clearly that my preference is for a political response , because , firstly , it is our responsibility as parliamentarians ; because , next , I believe it to be better to appeal to people &apos;s intelligence rather than confining them in their fear and their rancour ; because , finally , I believe in those words of Martin Luther King , assassinated in April 1968 , which said that injustice anywhere threatens justice everywhere .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Vondra , ladies and gentlemen , our Parliament takes pride in its unceasing defence of the respect for human dignity in all circumstances , including , of course , the conditions in which illegal immigrants are held .
Such super @-@ statehood and a centralised army for Europe I repudiate , as I do the Lisbon Treaty , which would make it all possible .
I would like to stress once again that the proposal does not have any financial implications .
It really is unbelievable that democracy can be practised and human rights observed on that basis .
Mr President , let me also start by congratulating Mr Ferber on a comprehensive estimate of Parliament &apos;s revenue and expenditure .
We will adapt our relations with Kenya , including as regards cooperation , to reflect changes in the situation and the actions of both sides .
The good of the patient should be at the forefront of our thoughts while examining the proposal for a directive .
Mr Van Rompuy , be a political actor , and come and look for political support here ; we will give it to you .
Madam President , we must work for success at the Luxembourg summit conference on employment and ensure that clear decisions are taken to improve the employment situation .
I would ask Mr Barroso , on this his birthday , and his colleagues , to help Ireland help itself on this one occasion and we will not come calling again for help by way of a bailout .
It is the minimum appropriation necessary for the Agency to carry out the new tasks assigned to it .
Is development the objective of these negotiations ?
I am still a fervent supporter of the principle of subsidiarity , and I therefore feel that the European Parliament should not be pointing a critical finger where it has no instruments and no powers to change anything .
Up to 40 000 people were made homeless by the main quake and numerous aftershocks .
I hope that the Commission will take up Parliament &apos;s suggestions , wishes and demands .
As the powers that be in Ukraine are obviously not unanimous in their desire to shut down Chernobyl , we should agree with the rapporteur &apos;s view on the Commission &apos;s responsibility .
First we admit that an American law is valid in the European Union .
What we need , then , if we are to do more than simply pay lip service to equality , are quotas - but they must be ambitious quotas , so that they really achieve something .
Direct foreign investment has grown faster this decade than trade .
They rather aim at complementing the framework by adding new aspects and , in particular , at strengthening the applicable rules as regards access of interest groups to the European Parliament premises .
Work on the database is going well and it will be available in the foreseeable future .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Madam President , I would also pay tribute to Mme Lulling , who has been tenacious to say the least in promoting and bringing this issue to the floor of the Parliament .
Interoperability has therefore become a fundamental concept for information and telecommunications networks .
We also note that the resolution sets one form of discrimination above others and is in itself a form of discrimination .
. The internal situation in Iran has for a number of years given considerable cause for concern .
Nigeria &apos;s position has been as follows , and I quote : &apos; There cannot be impunity for Taylor .
Secondly , I see great potential for using part of the Cohesion Fund for directing research spending to the new Member States , and I hope you will be sympathetic to that suggestion , Commissioner .
Secondly , we support the Commissioner in her struggle – – which is what it is – in the Council for a clear commitment of purpose , because it makes no sense to increase the road toll fees in order to improve road maintenance and expansion , if as a result the increased revenues are added to the general tax pool and go to finance no doubt very reasonable training or cultural measures or other policies .
Mr President , the vast majority of United Kingdom citizens or indeed EU citizens were deeply shocked and dismayed at the recent events at BNFL .
Some trust Russia , while the other side in the conflict is more open to the United States .
Once again , we are choosing the solution which reduces the advantage of Community preference .
Concerning the discussion about the financial issue of the EUR 5 million , the budget line available for the regulations on atmospheric pollution and forest fires also covered the EFICS .

Financial control on implementing the European Union budget takes place on three levels : internal control , within each institution ; external control , carried out by the European Court of Auditors ; and a discharge procedure carried out by Parliament .
The Commission supports their case unreservedly .
It is only when we meet all these criteria that we can truly say that we have worked properly on behalf of all the citizens of the European Union .
I voted in favour of the Batzeli report on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the European Year of Creativity and Innovation ( 2009 ) , as I believe creativity and innovation are essential for Europe to be competitive in a globalised world .
Moreover , it cannot be ruled out that the WTO will one day tackle the system provided under article 227 .
Despite all the difficulties and a mountain of debt , the new government is working to ensure that the ambitious goal of achieving a zero deficit remains in place .
in writing . - ( FR ) The Commission proposal introduces provisions that will enable definite progress to be made in the area of aviation security .
In particular , I would like to know whether we could count on your support if we were to launch the idea of working with a positive list when using the country of origin principle , possibly also in terms of the area of application .

Even the UN , in the country , does not know how much Russia has increased its peacekeeping forces .
That would create an incentive for using European Social Fund appropriations for subsidies to non @-@ governmental organisations .
Taking decisive steps and changing the global model of energy use - as Portugal and the Azores have already done - is vitally important , along with investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency .
The aim of the EGF is to help workers who are victims of the relocation of companies , and it is fundamental in facilitating access to new employment in the future .
The EU must protest strongly against this .
Parliament should have open and transparent channels for obtaining information and arranging follow @-@ up .
There are , however , many expensive budget lines remaining in the MFF that shouldn &apos;t be supported , and I &apos;m thinking of the EUR 6.6 billion to be spent on nuclear fusion as just one example .
I am delighted to note that this is the general view tonight , which was not the case when we began in July .
The application for a ban is on the table and that shows Turkey &apos;s lack of democratic maturity : the parties are not remotely perturbed that the governing party could be banned and that the Prime Minister himself could be barred from politics .
In addition the agreement which has been reached , and I shall come back to this , has prevented a serious confrontation which could have profoundly undermined the WTO , the multilateral trade organisation and its significance .
I am concerned by these ambiguities at which , quite frankly , I am amazed , to say the least , even just hearing the terms used .
Although industrial policy remains within the competence of the Member States , the European measures , encouragement of development and economic growth have considerable influence here .
To these can be added the rising age of health care workers , the fact that these workers are leaving certain countries to work abroad , the increased movement of EU citizens between Member States and the growing levels of immigration from third countries into the EU .
According to Swedish studies there is no evidence of research at EU level being more valuable than the research carried out in Member States .
Quite apart from that , it is unacceptable that death sentences should still be being carried out , particularly on juveniles and the mentally handicapped , and there is still no confirmation that execution by stoning is now a thing of the past and will not be revived .
Abyei must not reach a point of no return that would undo more than six years of negotiations .
Madam President , it is slightly difficult to speak on this resolution because as yet it has not been translated and brought up to the office .
We see winners and losers , the losers being the tens of thousands of local civilians who are withdrawing or fleeing in fear of government units .
From my own experience in the Netherlands , I know that works councils have often acquitted themselves better , when firms close down , than the management which was accountable to investors .
With the official purpose of providing security for elections , 2 000 EU soldiers are to be deployed in the Congo , yet we know – and the German defence minister has himself said – what this is actually all about ; it is actually all about safeguarding Germany ’ s and the EU &apos;s economic interests , and now – or so I see from the plan – the Sudan is the next country to get the treatment , this time with NATO involvement .
That is why I hope the judicial investigations will continue , as is happening in some Member States , including my own country .
Companies will be required to demonstrate the positive effect on the animal and the absence of any risk to human or animal health or the environment when applying for authorisation or re @-@ authorisation of a feed additive .
If we do achieve a balance in development policy and commit all industrial nations to this , we have no reason to hide behind others .
Mr President , we are very worried about the current growth rate of the European economy , the high unemployment rates and all the social and environmental problems we have to deal with .
For the thousands of people imprisoned in the football stadium in Santiago who were tortured , beaten and who then disappeared , that is what the rule of law meant under Pinochet , so I do not think we should have too much tender mercy for him at the present time .
We have some on @-@ going cases but these are all in national judiciaries .
What exactly should its initial tasks be ?
- ( SV ) I have voted against the report because , in paragraph 29 , Parliament calls for &apos; European tax coordination where it is necessary to meet the Treaty objectives &apos; and urges the Commission and the Council to &apos; foster the process of convergence of VAT ... and of taxes on business income &apos; .
Mrs Oddy , the necessary checks have already been carried out , and I can confirm that the building in question does not belong to the Commission .
There has as yet not been sufficient examination of CCCTB to guarantee that such a taxation system would have a positive impact and it is likely that more evidence exists to the contrary .
Curiously , this amount is spread very unevenly over the ten years in question with most of it , more than EUR 50 million , concentrated in 2014 and 2015 .
Unnecessarily tight restrictions on the use of a library , for example , by excluding private study , is at odds with the principles of lifelong learning .
Namely , that the issuing of passports or travel documents to stateless persons permanently resident in a Member State does not fall under the competence of the Community .
In this regard , determined implementation of a policy to provide patients with recombinant factors is more necessary than ever in Europe .
Democracy cannot flourish without civil society , and there is no civil society without participation .
Further , I ask the Commission if it knows that in one major Italian municipality - namely Milan - migrant children , who in this case are mainly Roma , whose parents are not in a regular position with the law and do not have a residence permit , cannot attend state schools .
( DE ) Mr President , on a point of order , I would like to comment on what my esteemed colleague Mrs McGuinness said .
I believe this is the case , so any talk about efforts aimed at dismantling this kind of protection , or returning to the 19th century is simply not true .
In June of last year Europe &apos;s voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism .
The events of 11 September have fortunately brought such action and I look forward to travelling to Washington shortly to talk about common action between the European Union and the United States of America .
For instance , what does the right to good administration stipulated in the Charter mean for each citizen ?
in writing . - Although I fully support the European Citizen &apos;s initiative , I voted against the final legislative resolution because I am disappointed with how little was ultimately achieved with this promising tool .
No .
Having made these observations , which I would like to leave as suggestions for application in the future , I would like to repeat that we in the Liberal Group are in agreement with the positions expressed by the rapporteur , Mr Della Vedova , and we congratulate Commissioner Monti on his wonderful work .
With regard to the maximum working time at night , especially bearing in mind the situation of peripheral Member States such as Portugal , the solution adopted by the Council is more appropriate , which stipulates ten hours in every twenty @-@ four hours .
My second point concerns facilitation of cross @-@ border service provision .
We have already begun this important process .
I am particularly pleased with the vote cast in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , since 12 of the 21 amendments that were tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have been adopted .
( B5 @-@ 0232 / 2002 ) by Mr Wiersma , on behalf of the PSE Group , on the political situation in Moldavia / Moldova and the disappearance of Vlad Cubreacov ;
B5 @-@ 0216 / 2001 , by Mr Miranda , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , on the kidnapping of three Portuguese citizens in Cabinda , Angola ;
This is a step backwards .
Through biogas we have an opportunity both to increase renewable energy production and contribute to sustainable economic , agricultural and rural development .
The best way to preserve jobs is to create new jobs .
Europe &apos;s economic power , which is considerable , can only bring success with regard to the United States if the power that we have is backed up by a true political power .
I am also in favour of Romania ’ s accession , and will seek to ensure that we do all we can to make this a reality .
We must support Iranian civil society , which is rising up against the death penalty . Iran has one of the highest numbers of executions : 177 in 2006 .
So you have simply to decide when you ask for a document what you really want .
As European travel habits change ( e.g. the increase in short haul flights ) , and the tourism sector switches over to certain innovations ( e.g. online bookings ) , it is necessary to update the legal framework , regulating the collection of statistical information in the field of tourism .
President Bush &apos;s decision to impose steel tariffs is irrational .
Indeed , Mr Grosch &apos;s report will be complemented by the forthcoming report from Mr Chanterie , on behalf of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment dealing with the extension of the general working time directive and my own report on lorry drivers &apos; hours .
( LT ) Mr President , the work programme for 2011 presented by the European Commission really does seem rather ambitious .
Trouble @-@ free years of experience have shown that the current practice is in the interests of both intermediaries and customers .
Unlike Mr Pirker , we socialists are convinced that our approach to this question must be a humane approach rather than an economic approach , because we are talking here about the fate of human beings , not about common merchandise .
The June List is a committed opponent of common civil and criminal legislation at the EU level .
On the other hand , documents received or written by in @-@ house counsel for the enterprise for which he works are not protected .
( MT ) Madam President , I agree with those who say that the Common European Market , the single market , is probably the largest project the European Union has ever undertaken .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Now it is strangling Greece and other client states of the euro .
It is better to have a channel to do that .
Contrary to what the Commission has suggested , Articles 30 , 31 and 32 of the Euratom Treaty are not applicable , as the Commission would be interfering with the safety of nuclear installations in respect of their technical operation .
This political decision will be good for the euro zone , but most of all it will be good for the European Union .
Pushed by poverty , hunger , squalor and war , people will keep crossing the Mediterranean whether they fit our criteria or not .
He was actually the very last person entitled to get this second version of the Constitution adopted by Parliament , but these are the lengths that some people will go to in order to draw attention to themselves and make themselves look as if they are pulling all the strings .
However , we remain somewhat dissatisfied as regards the protection of nature and requirements under programmes such as NATURA 2000 .
This is roughly when the General Product Safety Directive came into force , which regulates the general requirements ensuring that products do not endanger a person &apos;s safety .
I am well aware , of course , that there must be incentives to encourage wider participation in this scheme .
I must point out that we regarded the work carried out by the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe as particularly important and we took due note of the reports produced by Mr Marty .
( LT ) The programmes of our local television broadcasters contain a lot of material from the United States .
All Member States need the flexibility to organise their own working time .
6 .
In addition , the accountability which results from transparency requirements is an important instrument for preventing all kinds of abuse .
Mr President , I wish to thank Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten and Mr Di Lello Finuoli for their excellent work on two texts that cover the same subject : the proposal for a directive and a draft framework decision on the protection of the environment through criminal law .
It gets to the heart of the matter .
However , this is the legislation we have as our basis for action .
This European Union is about a vision for the future .
Sports foods in particular need to be properly controlled , because consumers &apos; health is at stake , they have to be protected against false and inaccurate claims , not to mention the effect of such foodstuffs .
We are currently working out the criteria .
Mr Lenarčič , you must pay attention to social cohesion and environmental stability but you must do so secure in the knowledge that markets are the most powerful tool we have to improve living standards .
The advancement of clean coal technology is essential to our fulfilling our climate change targets , and there is such an urgency with this .
Are there any comments ?
As regards Turkey , I note the decision taken by the Council to partially suspend the negotiations on eight of the thirty @-@ five chapters .
We perhaps had something to hide where the Erika package was concerned .
This has somewhat obscured the fact that a motion of censure is actually a very simple question .
The Commission has opened an infringement procedure against Italy ; that was , unfortunately , inevitable , for certainly Campania is light years away from complying with the rules imposed by the European directives , which those in charge even in the government have disregarded .
Let me stress the point that this certification can only be awarded to products where no dolphin – or other species not being fished – is harmed .
The light transit system should be part of an integrated transport system .
The new directive targets two specific areas : consumer safety and the completion of the single market in food supplements .
– Madam President , much is spoken about preserving and enhancing European cultural heritage .
We also have to make a determined effort to endorse the Members ’ Statute , so that we can do away with a system that allows travel expenses to be claimed for no clear reason .
The trade name &apos; vodka &apos; should be reserved only for vodka that is produced from traditional ingredients , namely grain , potatoes and beet molasses .
For example , the defence of the right to work clearly and explicitly enshrined in the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic ( Article 58 ) and the European Social Charter ( Article 1 ) is &apos; adapted &apos; and &apos; modernised &apos; in the CFR and becomes the &apos; right to engage in work.&apos;
It is to take new ideas and try them out in LEADER , with the participants on the ground , with the local organisations on the ground , with many non @-@ governmental organisations , with the churches , with all those who have helped actually to get new ideas up and running in rural communities .
This means partnership , which , on the one hand , aims at the clear representation of interests , but also , on the other , their equalisation by means of information and consultation in shared dialogue .

This lack of consumer protection is truly unacceptable , and it calls for a European response that provides for the assessment of airlines , promotes assistance for passengers caught in these situations and sets out compensation for damages .

However , in accordance with the common basic principles on Roma inclusion , the proposal does not exclude other marginalised groups sharing similar social economic circumstances .
